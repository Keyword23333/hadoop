4340000 its probably why youve seen some of the records being broken out there particularly in the longer events
4340001 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4340002 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4340003 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4340004 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4340005 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4340006 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4340007 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4340008 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4340009 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4340010 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4340011 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food

4340025 the body that is currently being studied is being referred to as the rickmat creature a name derived from the names of rick dyer and matthew whitton
4340026 im extremely skeptical about this bigfoot claim i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi the bigfoot hunter holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect the fact that the two georgian men who said they found the body turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4340027 that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4340028 put on a bikini put it on and stay strong
4340029 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere

4340051 we have a great rivalry this race is going to be more exciting than they all have been shell be rested weve been waiting for this for a long time shes the main challenge also the rest of the jamaicans as well its going to be a really great final
4340052 their nbcs strategic reasons were made for what people felt are valid commercial reasons i would humbly challenge those reasons this is the second most popular sport in the world to football soccer
4340053 its a huge injustice to the athletes who have worked so hard theres too many exciting athletes to talk about athletes who have cheated amazing things are going to happen
4340054 its a responsibility weve been given the opportunity to do what we love and have america look at us and bring some hope back to the sport maybe we can change the face of the sport
4340055 were excited about the position and ready to take it on
4340056 the only other stretch i can remember was in 2005 early in the season but i think this is probably a little bit worse its not a lot of fun
4340057 im not trying to describe games right now to be honest with you just

4340077 a statement by the presidential press office said talabani entered the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota on aug 2 for knee surgery but the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves

4340084 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4340085 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4340086 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4340087 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4340088 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition

4340098 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4340099 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable

4340112 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today we are dealing with a group of extremely competitive guys and john is one of them he agreed to the first three code violations but disagreed with the fourth for an obscene gesture john said that he did not do it and the umpire said he 100 percent categorically saw it we have to go with the umpires ruling
4340113 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4340114 i dont really have anyone to blame but myself this is like a long story that culminates in me getting defaulted in a big tournament i mean i guess it was bound to happen its too bad i dont feel good about it but i cant say that im totally surprised
4340115 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

4340123 i thought immediately that the contents which appeared to recognize and concretize the bangsamoros right to self determination and ancestral domain were too good and too generous to be true
4340124 the moa was so contrary to the greedy and brutal character of the grp government of the republic of the philippines whose presumptions and actuations i have long known in the course of revolutionary struggle and the grp ndfp peace negotiations
4340125 the pretense at generosity is full of malice it is calculated to outwit and outflank the milf and the bangsamoro and to facilitate frontal military attacks against them they are being left no choice but to wage revolutionary struggle in order to advance their cause of national self determination there is a heightened need for the unity cooperation of the milf and the ndfp in their distinct and common concerns and causes against the same adversaries
4340126 it was almost predictable that the signing of the moa would be aborted the public release of the draft only a few days before the date of signing was clearly meant to stir up a controversy big enough to cause the abortion
4340127 it is obvious that the us has been out to sidle up to and ingratiate itself with the milf and the bangsamoro in order to further strengthen its position in exploiting the human and natural resources of the bangsamoro and deploying us military forces in mindanao
4340128 unilaterally or in cahoots with the grp the us can use the high expectations raised by the moa among the milf and bangsamoros to justify us military presence and advance us hegemony in mindanao
4340129 prolong grp milf informal talks and ceasefire and to deploy larger us and philippine military forces against the milf and the bangsamoro
4340130 new zealand has looked at it before it is all a matter of timing and priorities and we think the moment is right to have another look
4340131 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4340132 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4340133 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4340134 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4340135 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4340136 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4340137 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4340138 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4340139 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4340140 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4340141 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4340184 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4340267 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4340268 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4340278 if they truly believed the shipments were in violation of the law
4340279 it will be genuinely unfortunate if they are forced to close their doors
4340280 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4340281 because companies that violate federal law are the type of company that the government does not want to continue in that particular business

4340285 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
4340286 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
4340287 its not heres a check come back in a year

4340298 ben and his family have elected to pursue alternative actions regarding his eligibility status
4340299 as such all comments on the matter should come directly from ben his family or their representation

4340304 in the days and weeks ahead the department of defense will re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4340305 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4340306 we work on a lot of short game up there
4340307 well do two hours of chipping or two hours of putting
4340308 i missed the eagle putt but i just wanted to lag it up there i knew i could do it after that hole i won 10 11 and 12
4340309 i thought i played really well today especially my iron play
4340310 i didnt go after a whole lot of puts i just lagged them i hit a lot of greens so that was really good
4340311 my caddy told me to hit it right here which was a spot right in the fringe and let it trickle down
4340312 fortunately it was the right spot it hit the pin and dropped in the cup
4340313 i like ending on that note because i was a little conservative the whole day the first match is always the one where you dont want to get beat
4340314 taking her to 16 and losing on a chip i felt great about it
4340315 my driver was pretty good today and i chipped well
4340316 its going to come down to me beating him every night
4340317 the more nights i can beat him the better we are if i can beat him every night in the feature then well be o k

4340320 this was an awesome awesome race track for racing im just blessed more than anything to get to drive two race cars
4340321 were trying to make up for some lost rainouts this year weve been struggling this year and the only way you can work through that is by running laps
4340322 thats what probably won the 360 for us is to run the 410 and be comfortable with it
4340323 to have a race track like this slick off and be as racy as it was to have two or three grooves and not hurt tires my hats off to these guys at waynesfield
4340324 they are professional photographers who get behind the scenes passes to photography these musicians up close and personal
4340325 its very intimate theres a lot of emotion on the singers faces its a vantage point people might not necessarily get to see
4340326 its really beautiful and its capturing these legends and up and coming bands its really difficult in the low light and physical situations when everything is moving fast and theres a short amount of time and what they produce is beautiful and colorful
4340327 youre still looking at classic applications of photography composition lighting subject matter it has the elements of traditional photography its just the subject matter is slightly different

4340340 i havent been contacted by any of the principal people involved in this ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4340341 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable

4340354 it is a very specialist role and she will be doing the vital job of putting in place the framework for the financial structure of our federation we have to get that right and her cv is most impressive
4340355 once yoke has put the framework in place we will be looking for a permanent finance director to take the role forward
4340356 the thing to remember is that we are entering new territory here running two schools on separate sites but under one strategic umbrella
4340357 if we had cancelled the whole show it would have been a financial disaster
4340358 one of the reasons we made sure we kept on going for as long as possible was to make sure exhibitors had the chance to at least cover their costs
4340359 if we had cancelled it on the thursday night which was a possibility they would have lost everything
4340360 at the moment i have no idea what the final cost will be all i can say is that it will be massive
4340361 we have built up a war chest that hopefully will deal with a situation like this

4340376 there were some tough times on the fells but actually overall we found it easier than we had imagined i think thats because we did so much pre planning and training

4340381 he went for some physiotherapy at the cumberland infirmary in carlisle and they took blood tests he was very quickly diagnosed with duchenne the worst form of muscular dystrophy

4340383 he is a very bright and articulate boy we know in future he is likely to suffer behavioural as well as physical problems
4340384 it would be lovely if someone finds a cure that helps him and fellow sufferers

4340513 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
4340514 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
4340515 that would result in an annual reduction of stroke coronary heart disease and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
4340516 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
4340517 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling
4340518 much more needs to be done to ensure that patients with high blood pressure receive appropriate counseling on lifestyle change including counseling on the importance of regular aerobic exercise from their physicians

4340570 he does whatever it takes to win and thats the kind of attitude we want on everyone in this dressing room
4340571 every season prior to last year was different for me
4340572 i was healthy two years ago but then had the ankle issues this past season was one in which i grew a lot of confidence and really found my role before i was out there playing in all the games and contributing in a small factor but this season i had more responsibility on the ice and was more of a key factor in the dressing room and on the ice i had a lot bigger picture for myself now i have something i can build on and grow on where as before i just had to keep coming in and keep working for a spot now i want to expand my role and keep the momentum i have created
4340573 i just want to be one of the players that contribute toward the team that has never changed for me
4340574 i think im a player that contribute defensively and a little bit offensively i want to expand on that this coming season i still think last season was a stepping stone to getting to where this team needs me to be as a player in the future as my role
4340575 team wise it was a huge step for a lot of us on the roster there were 10 or 15 guys on the team that made strides in their individual games to help the team be better on the ice i was just fortunate to be one of those guys that made that kind of a jump
4340576 when i first came in it was derian hather and richard matvichuk and some of the older guys who were the leaders in the room
4340577 this last season the tide has kind of turned marty turco are at the forefront of the leadership but im now one of the guys who can speak up and help those guys i want to be looked upon as a leader on our team you have to lead by example you cant take games off you have to carry yourself well off the ice too that is something i take pride in trying to help the leadership on our team because it is so young if were all pulling on the same rope it definitely translates on the ice

4340687 sikkim chief minister mr pawan chamling can help us a lot as the only nepali speaking national leader
4340688 mr chamling was the first person to raise the gorkhaland issue even before gjm took it up for which the people of darjeeling have great respect for him

4340820 what i said was they have a very talented football team and they are the most talented team in the state of texas
4340821 i dont remember questioning their toughness i was actually assessing their talent
4340822 once we step out on the field with texas the only ones who can help us is ourselves texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
4340823 my defense will get to a point where they will be mean nasty and ornery bastards and thats what you need for texas texas will move the ball with tit for tat screens and options but well make them pay a price whenever they catch one of those dinky passes well put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas

4340826 you all the news stories first before its even true
4340827 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
4340828 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
4340829 would be very unpleasant for most people to watch its really a gathering of curmudgeons expressing frustration and upset and the rest of the day is spent trying to mask or repress that through whatever creative devices we can find
4340830 those types of stories that can almost like the guy in the green mile

4340836 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
4340837 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal
4340838 being conducted on the scale that bush conducted things or even the clintons i dont think it has the same true viciousness and contempt
4340839 to name things that dont seem to have a name
4340840 named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
4340841 10 years of making even people who agree with you cringe
4340842 time it takes lenscrafters to make you a pair of bifocals
4340843 may be exaggerated on the show its grounded in the way jon really feels

4340846 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
4340847 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
4340848 for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess there is in our hearts so we can move on to the business of making you laugh
4340849 sit in the back of the country and make wisecracks

4340903 a dream is something that might be possible i didnt think this would be possible
4340904 its really opened my eyes to this level of play
4340905 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
4340906 id rather be 100 percent going into the olympics than 85 percent with some races under my belt he said
4340907 dont be afraid to try something new an amateur built the arc professionals built the titanic
4340908 i am not going to give up the dream of both
4340909 which is the source of distrust and conflict has to be eliminated completely
4340910 i have expectations that north korea will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4340911 opening the age of the pacific and the age of eurasia simultaneously a unified korea will leap toward the center of the global community
4340912 in europe wagons are considered the sportiest body style here its the predecessor to the minivan
4340913 we like to think were on the front end of change
4340914 its a nice addition to the line but dont expect huge volumes for it
4340915 its a small percentage of our sales but a very loyal customer
4340916 there are 3 kinds of people in the world those who try
4340917 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4340918 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4340919 i think everybodys pleased the start of the season is finally here
4340920 and thats not just the players its very clear that the fans are also raring to go
4340921 last season they probably should have won the home and away part of the competition frank farina roar coach always prepares his sides well theyre a mobile team and a young team and theyll be tough but i think if we can get on top of them then weve got the firepower to overcome them
4340922 everyone has had a good pre season and we want to take that form into the season it hasnt been easy to pick the team but im sure the 15 that have been included will do the job for us
4340923 we played during the 2008 pre season cup and we know their strengths and weaknesses they key is to close their midfield down because thats where theyre quite strong if we can do that well go a long way toward winning this game
4340924 daves getting in tonight and hell give me a call then so ill be able to find out if hell be playing or not if he does play then im sure ill let him know that im out there therell be no love lost i might put a strong challenge on him or give him a bit of a nudge as i go past
4340925 daves a mummys boy so im sure hell have mums support
4340926 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4340927 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4340928 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4340929 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4340930 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4340931 how we got our name back then was when we first got in we wanted to be called the mercenaries
4340932 that would be a good thing to write in your book but i was sleeping i dont remember anything and everyone who was there can testify to that
4340933 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4340934 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4340935 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4340936 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4340937 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4340938 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4340939 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4340940 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4340941 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4340942 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4340943 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4340944 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4340945 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4340946 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4340947 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4340948 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4340949 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4340950 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4340951 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4340952 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4340953 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4340954 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4340955 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4340956 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4340957 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4340958 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4340959 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4340960 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4340961 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4340962 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4340963 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4340964 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4340965 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4340966 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4340967 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4340968 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4340969 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4340976 auf der ebene der regierung wird an einem solchen konzept nicht gearbeitet
4340977 es gibt keine notwendigkeit ber ein solches programm berhaupt nur zu diskutieren

4340987 we had previously indicated that we would review any new information that was brought forward
4340988 during the dependency hearing another theory was advocated concerning the death of this infant and we will look at that theory
4340989 is the case closed or do we go to a different plan
4340990 weve been saying all along that there are a lot of questions that arent answered we need some explanation thats the least we deserve
4340991 we are excited to get rolling it should be a great project
4340992 i have mixed emotions about how things turned out but it was the best under the circumstances i am pleased the board approved this license transfer and that construction will resume
4340993 i dont agree with people who say this license should be revoked and rebid
4340994 that would be disastrous for thousands of families of construction workers and for the city allegheny county and the state
4340995 we took a deliberate stance and made sure we understood everything even though we faced a storm of criticism
4340996 i think were far beyond the debate on whether gambling is right or wrong for pennsylvania the reality is its coming now we as city residents and myself as mayor have to deal with those ramifications
4340997 theres going to be negatives associated with it we all know that but i think if we plan and prepare for it it will allow us to be more successful
4340998 were looking at a new casino next year in 2009 and then a new arena the following year so i think that overall today is one of the more exciting days in the city of pittsburghs history

4341005 i dont see this team ever leaving this is a great hockey market
4341006 its been a long time coming its something thats exciting for all of us
4341007 it was a painful process but the end result was worth it
4341008 i cant wait to sit on one of those seats in the new arena
4341009 i wait wait and about 11 oclock about six of them they come around
4341010 to look at their faces they dont look good and they say sorry youve been cancelled
4341011 im actually supporting and calling for much greater accountability and transparency and performance indicators that tell us how often these kind of things are happening

4341021 even though these islanders arent filling up at the pump high gas prices are having a devastating effect on their livelihood many of the visitors who would normally flock to the island are opting to stay at home rather than spend the extra 30 or 40 on gas the ferries from the mainland have increased their prices to off set their rising fuel costs and cutback on their runs to the island stores are hurting because there are fewer visitors to buy their products food and other necessities cost more for not just visitors to the island but for those who live and work there indeed all americans are seeing the cost of their basic necessities skyrocketing whether youre on mackinac island in manhattan or mississippi its the same story
4341022 rep bart stupak d mi sided with his party leadership last week and voted for a five week vacation without addressing americas energy crisis
4341023 now the question for bart stupak is simple does stupak think that speaker pelosi should call congress back into session to vote on energy
4341024 or will stupak continue to ignore the overwhelming majority of americans who support republican efforts to increase american oil drilling now that stupak has some time off back in his district he should at least take the time to explain to his constituents why he votes to take a vacation instead of staying in washington to deliver real solutions for americas energy crisis
4341025 stupak has made protecting the great lakes one of his signature priorities
4341026 on may 25 2006 the house of representatives voted to approve a bill h r 5429 that would authorize drilling in anwr i voted against this bill because i do not believe that the limited amount of oil that could be produced would be enough to jeopardize this ecologically important region i believe there are some environmentally sensitive areas that should not be open to oil or gas drilling like our great lakes
4341027 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4341028 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4341029 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4341030 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

4341065 the daily call volume of the natick fire department is on the rise
4341066 the department no longer has the resources necessary to adequately meet the demands of our growing community
4341067 as fire chief it is my duty and responsibility to make the community aware of the deficiencies and unsafe conditions that exist
4341068 today we no longer have the resources necessary to adequately protect the town of natick or to provide reasonable safe response capabilities for its firefighters
4341069 one thing we better not suggest is that if we have an ambulance go down they are in danger of losing ambulance service other communities will assist
4341070 i dont disagree its an issue but i dont want residents of natick to think their lives are in danger and we dont live in a safe community
4341071 this has not been done for years we have gone through a number of chiefs the last few years and now we have one who plans to be around for a while

4341078 were actually hanging onto our kittens later in the season
4341079 i would definitely concur that the cat season has just been unbelievable
4341080 the amount of calls of stray cats have gone way up way up
4341081 the times are very bad but that community feeling is still there among the animal groups

4341110 is there a reasonable expectation that they could be photographed without their knowledge
4341111 i hired the guy to photograph me and my horses so i could have prints imagine my surprise when they showed up in the paper
4341112 these guys asked if they could take pictures of me and a few weeks later there i am in the paper
4341113 gee i could be paid instead of getting nothing for this photo
4341114 gee id rather get nothing for this picture than a check

4341119 we obviously werent a very good team the first couple of months it put us in a big hole
4341120 but its not like just because its the end of the year you stop working theres always stuff you can help these guys out with and at least give them some good ideas of what they need to work on in the off season
4341121 if a guy shuts it down in the middle of august because his focus is gone or hes looking forward to the off season were keeping score of that stuff it is going to go into his personal evaluation theres always something to play for
4341122 ive thought about it the chance to be up with the blue jays in september
4341123 who knows youre never really going to know until it happens we have 17 games left so we might as well put it on full burn and finish strong

4341125 the last three four weeks of the season i hate to say it determines a lot of what the decisions are for next year

4341135 the espresso machine was too big for the house anyway
4341136 so now its under the back patio with a timer to come one in time for breakfast
4341137 the constant urge to know assimilate amp cross link information is the main reason why i was driven to quizzing the satisfaction one derives after working out an answer with the help of clues is enormous
4341138 india is one of the quizzing capitals of the world parents encourage their kids to quiz and being a quizzer is seen as equivalent of being brainy at school and college levels quizzing is a very popular pursuit which then gradually dies down due to the pressures of professional life quizzing communities have used sites groups and blogs to stay in touch
4341139 television and internet have been the biggest factors for the spread of quizzing popular quiz shows like kbc bournvita quiz contest mastermind bt acumen tata crucible etc have helped quizzing gain mass acceptance
4341140 for example this happened with me in one of the general quizzes i attended recently the question was which indian city is believed to have got its name when lord shiva showered divine nectar on it from his matted locks though being clueless we figured out that the suitable sanskrit hindi word for nectar would be madhu thus we guessed madhurai and it turned out to be right
4341141 a stamp depicting a tower cum antennae at new foundland canada was shown for a second it stumped me then it dawned on me that perhaps its something related to radio especially trans atlantic transmission after being passed by all the other teams i replied maybe this tower commemorates marconis first trans atlantic wireless signal this turned out to be a right answer much to my surprise
4341142 in todays world a certain amount of commercialization is inevitable and welcome corporate sponsorships have only made events more slick and glamorous while the lowest common denominator for an event like kbc is money the overall publicity has had a positive rub off on quizzing moreover quality of quizzing has improved over the years in spite of or maybe because of this commercialization
4341143 the scope is huge but one needs to have a passion for research when i joined greycaps i thought i would take it as it comes but now three years into this career i cant see myself having chosen a better path whats best is you get paid to do what you love doing
4341144 personally i never advise youngsters to take up quizzing as a career option the perishability of a quizmaster is very high i am a pickbrain only till the next pickbrain surfaces it is not a job you can do for 58 years as a profession quizzing needs constant innovation and an endless thought processes if you just pick some questions for a particular event without doing a comprehensive research you may end up making a fool of yourself but ya for those who are passionate about quizzing this is the right time to get going
4341145 you must take interest in varied subjects you must have an aptitude that allows you to assimilate and store a lot of information and essentially an ability to recall them whenever required
4341146 just having knowledge and being able to speak good english does not suffice a quizmaster needs to understand his audience and be an entertainer at heart he needs to have a good sense of humour at the same time a mature speaker
4341147 to be a quizmaster you dont need to be highly knowledgeable you just need to be a good host you need to be amiable and able to connect with the audience of course you should be decently informed if you are an uninformed person you just cannot carry it off
4341148 from a practical point of view initially you wont have too much moolah once you start getting shows you are on it i do two three shows a month and i make rs 20 30 000 off them
4341149 to be a researcher you need to be inquisitive questioning should come naturally to you you must have a passion for finding new stuff you need to know sources for varied information and most importantly which most people lack these days is that you must know how to use the internet there is a lot of stuff on the net but you must know how to get to it
4341150 there is a serious lack of good research teams there are people who do research but it can be far better in 60 70 of the cases there isnt much quality in terms of questions there are repetitions and arbitrary stuff
4341151 mere awareness will not fetch you success in quizzes rather applying a fair amount of lateral thinking also becomes important
4341152 for example this happened with me in one of the general quizzes i attended recently the question was which indian city is believed to have got its name when lord shiva showered divine nectar on it from his matted locks though being clueless we figured out that the suitable sanskrit hindi word for nectar would be madhu thus we guessed madhurai and it turned out to be right

4341164 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4341165 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4341187 it is essential that we behave with grace and charity towards everyone
4341188 remember too that some speeches in the general synod and reactions since have shown us that there are many people including bishops who do not agree with us about women bishops but do not want to see the marginalisation or ex clusion of our contribution from the ongoing life of the church of england

4341194 its the hardest part of the game to swallow when you make your pitch and dont get the guy out
4341195 its frustrating especially because all our games are going to be close typically we dont blow guys out so those little balls that get through like that it just gets frustrating

4341239 i speak on behalf of the entire territory in sharing our excitement for the significant increase in cruise ship arrivals that we can anticipate for st croix in 2009
4341240 i would like to recognize the collaborative efforts of the cruise ship working group that made this news a reality this news demonstrates that we are expanding our core tourism market by showcasing our offerings on st croix thereby opening new opportunities for our small businesses
4341241 the expansion of cruise ship activity to st croix is an indication of the diversity of our tourism products and recognizes the strength of this sector and the fostering of long term relationships at local and national levels
4341242 there are several familiar faces in this stanford superstars squad but there are some exciting new additions such as lindon james lionel baker and chad hampson and this was due to the fact that there were some high quality performances from these individuals in the stanford 20 20 tournaments and they were also very impressive in the just concluded stanford superstars camp

4341245 i feel it very appropriate to announce to this gathering that subject to cabinet approval an airlift taskforce headed by the minister for tourism will be set up to make the airlift taskforce a permanent body to continually seek to improve the relationship with the airlines
4341246 the last time we had an issue like this a task force was set up to examine the problem and they did manage the situation admirably
4341247 liat has indicated that they may well be able to arrange an early and a late flight between san juan and the virgin islands
4341248 how very serious this administration is about what we are doing to ensure the survival of the industry and economy in the british virgin islands
4341249 it means that we are no longer going to be reacting to what is happening we are always going to be proactive
4341250 any fear that the small man is going to gamble off his money should be dismissed we are talking about high end gamblers you have to have good credit cards before you can even consider entering these casinos
4341251 you never know they might mess around and never make the final
4341252 last year everybody had me paste for a bronze medal

4341256 besides catering for people who may get sick at events the ministry of health has taken good care to ensure that certain vector borne diseases are going to be problem during carifesta and should not be a problem at anytime
4341257 another element of our health response is that our port health programme at the cheddi jagan international airport the moleson creek exit point at the brazil border and at the shipping sites we will ensure that persons who come into the country are properly immunized for example it is required that people are vaccinated against yellow fever to enter guyana of they are coming from certain countries such as africa
4341258 ive worked hard for the months so i do think that my hard work will pay off
4341259 im not sure if ill be doing both events but if i do both the 100m and 200m i think im ready
4341260 ill be taking it one race at a time first ill deal with the 100 metres then ill look to the 200m but im definitely looking forward to score in both events
4341261 ive worked really hard for this so its an honour to go under 11
4341262 i really put in a lot of hard work to get to where i am now
4341263 i just want to go out there and do my best and achieve as much as possible
4341264 when i come back this time its all about business
4341265 ive waited four years for a rematch im not taking it lightly
4341266 veronica campbell is an amazing competitor we have a really great rivalry
4341267 this race is going to be more exciting than they have been she will be rested more weve been waiting for this for a long time
4341268 she has been running fantastic all year its going to be a really great final
4341269 i definitely think i am everything in practice points to that
4341270 i just have a couple of fine tuning things in the next few days and i will be ready to go
4341271 im definitely not disappointed at all at running the 100 it definitely helped my 200 for the first 100 of my race
4341272 im exactly where i need to be with my training in the end it will definitely pay off
4341273 i did run poorly it was just a bit of exhaustion my legs were dead
4341274 now im hitting my times in practice and im exactly where i need to be im confident
4341275 after eight years in power putin has secretly accumulated more than 40bn the sum would make him russias and europes richest man
4341276 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jetter assaulted the guard at the premiers home and proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister
4341277 the premier at no time had any physical contact with lisaraye but as a result of her assault on them both the premier and his sister were taken to the hospital with injuries and later released
4341278 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4341279 i am announcing that i am separated from lisaraye mccoy misick
4341280 last night an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force
4341281 it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered
4341282 and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its enquiries
4341283 while it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me
4341284 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4341285 the economic logic of us cuba trade is so powerful that it trumps political hostilities
4341286 if the embargo were lifted then a flood of trade and investment would pour into cuba transforming both the economies of cuba and south florida in the process
4341287 i dont know that mark penn had a heck of a lot to do with the winning new hampshire strategy
4341288 it would be nice to take the field its always good to play against your old team and especially up in townsville as well in front of family and friends
4341289 prince is trying hard to play so i wouldnt rule out that possibility
4341290 theres no denying that if he played wed try and run at him
4341291 ross is going very very well but jason has stepped up to a whole new level
4341292 its tough on ross but nobody could have foreseen how well jason would go

4341294 if you win the world championships it is not automatic you will win the olympics

4341297 the problem with this world is that not enough people watch birds
4341298 chela didnt want to put the gloves on at first
4341299 it tires her out and it tires me out too
4341300 this isnt over yet we expect more harassment and bombing
4341301 the bank will continue to put a tight lid on cost and expenses to mitigate the weakness in revenues brought about by lower trading and forex gains
4341302 we expect loan growth to be moderate for the rest of the year owing to short term concerns on the economy and volatile commodity prices
4341303 in religion something that we had thought irrevocably forgotten is made present again a returns and what we took to be an berwindung overcoming realization and thus a setting aside is no more than a verwindung a long convalescence that has once again to come to terms with the indelible trace of its sickness
4341304 it is only because metaphysical meta narratives have been dissolved that philosophy has rediscovered the plausibility of religion and can consequently approach the religious need of common consciousness independently of the framework of enlightenment critique
4341305 the conception of religion outlined here at least preserves the attention to mythology found in schellings positive philosophy yet less as a more adequte way of knowing truths that transcend reason than as a language appropriate to the narration of events that can only be handed down in the form of myths
4341306 the philosophy that poses the problem of overcoming metaphysics is the same as that which discovers the positivity in the religious experience
4341307 it is just and only when philosophy recognizes its own provenance in trinitarian theology that it begins to voersome these aporiae or at least to discover a sense in them that is not purely contradictory
4341308 how to pronounce the end of meta narratives if not by narrating the history of their dissolution
4341309 god is incarnated and thus is first revealed in the biblical pronouncement that ultimately gives rise to the post metaphysical concepton of the event like character of being
4341310 because if it is struck down the government is going to lose face will the other side milf still believe them
4341311 what if the sc strikes down the moa there will no longer be a peace process if there is no peace process what will we have
4341312 what were seeing now is the difficulty of moving forward if the court strikes it down its not a simple problem
4341313 the thing is its a negotiation you agreed when you talk about renegotiation after a strike by sc there will be many psychological elements that includes loss of face
4341314 im sure well talk about how we can move forward
4341315 whats clear is we cannot stop the negotiations thats how important peace is nagkakagulo na nga uli e
4341316 gma is not the problem because during the time of fvr the issues raised were the same
4341317 erupts whenever there is a trigger such as the moa ad
4341318 the trigger in 1996 was the spcpd southern philippines council for peace and development the trigger in 1988 was moslem mindanao
4341319 you cross the bridge in these formal negotiations both sides and you be a bridge within civil society level we need bridges of peace and media can play that role
4341320 should not get involved in the cockfights sabong because we already have too many fights
4341321 strong influences in the community but they are not part of the talks for peace
4341322 it is not true that there was no air force chopper that arrived the chopper was available but the weather condition did not allow the chopper to evacuate the wounded
4341323 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4341324 our feedback from the dept of foreign affairs is that the philippine embassy has been the only post thats complied with all the requirements as far as the implementation of the new passport regulations is concerned
4341325 we made arrangements with the filipino organization there who collected passport applications sent them to us and we are now preparing the computer generated forms later this month one of our staff will go there to take the computer generated forms so they can sign the forms in her presence
4341326 even if they can easily get a us visa the airfare today for a family of two or three is a huge burden
4341327 our appeal is for these leaders to coordinate closely with the consular posts concerned
4341328 so well know just how many people we should send this does not only entail the deployment of people this also has financial implications because we operate on a fixed budget
4341329 they can verify that the person who signs our computer generated forms that will be mailed to these honorary consuls is who he claims to be
4341330 people in georgia and florida can mail their applications to us we print the computer generated forms we send the forms to the honorary consuls and the applicants can go to them to sign and affix their signature they dont have to go to washington dc anymore
4341331 our appeal is for these new applicants to bear with us with this requirement because the philippines is the last country in asia to comply with international civil aviation organization requirement of a machine readable passport
4341332 this is going to be a big help to stop human trafficking
4341333 if the validity of the passport is less than one year we encourage them to apply now for the new passport because most countries require that the passport should have at least six months validity
4341334 possibly propping up the notion that overseas filipino workers may be conduits for terrorist funding or money laundering
4341335 food security in the philippines is projected to remain stable
4341336 the active search is complete but we will continue to investigate
4341337 matt was so taken with bow lake and the beautiful surrounding area
4341338 saturday afternoon was a warm sunny day so matt decided to take out a kayak he took a book and some sunscreen with him after he had been gone for about an hour a severe thunderstorm passed through
4341339 they had done a very good job of preparing us mentally this was the likelihood
4341340 its always hard going to india you really need to go there and familiarise yourself with the country the wickets and the conditions
4341341 were looking at it at the moment the champions trophy is still going ahead so we can only plan as if that is going to happen

4341374 you take away his second and third inning where his pitch count ran up and he would have been a lot more efficient

4341386 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
4341387 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
4341388 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
4341389 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
4341390 even if we go in the house close the windows and turn up music its loud it never stops

4341396 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially

4341406 i do like the voluminous naturale because it doesnt clump the brush has very short bristles which i think helps it separates the lashes well and it has staying power i only use mascara on the top lashes though but im betting there is no smudging if one chooses to wear on the bottom lashes the long wearing formula might be the only drawback when it comes to removing it i use arbonnes wipe out eye makeup remover but you still need to be gentle and slow when removing this particular mascara it seems other mascaras seem to come off more easily

4341425 bumblebees are a critical pollinator of a lot of the fruits and vegetables we eat every day
4341426 they are linked to a lot of crops we depend on without the bees we would require manual pollination but it wouldnt take long before wed have to completely take some of the crops out of our diet
4341427 the disease spillover from domesticated bumblebees contributes to the decline of the wild bumblebee population but we are not suggesting it is the only factor at play
4341428 whether one is a predominant factor is too early to say
4341429 there are beekeepers that have been wiped out in the last two years
4341430 greater attention to their diseases and their overlap with wild species would greatly reduce or even eliminate pathogen spillover
4341431 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

4341459 there are a couple of nicta projects looking at feasibility around the bionic eye but our view is that the science is not quite there yet to contribute an ict level design for such a device yet

4341588 were feeling something as old as the world something god feels the bible begins with god making people who have freedom freedom to love god or not to love god and these people consistently choose not to love god
4341589 the story of the bible tells us of a living being who loves and who continues to love even when that love is not returned a god who refuses to override our freedom who respects our power to decide wether to reciprocate a god who lets us make the next move
4341590 in matters of love its as if god as agreed to play by the same rules we do god can do what makes god god but god cant do everything god cant make us love our choice love is risky for god too
4341591 he always went out of his way to help people
4341592 so many of us are still trying to figure out our purpose in this life
4341593 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year
4341594 yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift
4341595 before you pull the splinter out of your brothers eye take the plank out of yours
4341596 for some trust in horses and chariots but i must put my trust in god
4341597 my freshman year i got into the more popular crowd but that didnt really work out well for me suddenly my friends stopped talking to me and to this day i still dont know why that happened
4341598 then i ended up becoming a total punk rocker i had a pink mohawk my junior year and was much more of an outcast
4341599 i had been looking for a town that had only one high school because i thought it would be more of a social pressure cooker that wasnt right next to a big city because when youre in a big city you can escape and make other friends if things are going awry
4341600 i called hundreds of high schools and i found 10 that were willing to give me the access and i went to each of them and interviewed all the incoming seniors that were interested
4341601 thats what made warsaw unique you would have these underdogs show up and be interested and be comfortable talking about themselves with a stranger no matter how insecure they were
4341602 he not only was willing to be articulate to me but he also went out and actively looked for a girlfriend despite his series of rejections and insecurities
4341603 they are more accustomed to showing who they are and speaking honestly about who they are to their peers obviously a camera is another step but its different than when we grew up
4341604 i dont think teenagers realize the repercussions of their actions and so that can be awful because you can send out something of yourself and youre not thinking oh my god this can spread everywhere you just dont think ahead a lot at that age
4341605 a lot of people do regrettable things in high school
4341606 after sundance i went to warsaw and showed it to their parents and high school administrators and teachers that also went fine they were all ok with the movie some even extremely happy with it
4341607 people rightfully wanted to know what was going on with them since so much time had elapsed
4341608 one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
4341609 i was in the back of the car pretending to be han and luke with my brother mike

4341611 david has always liked science fiction the whole star wars thing godzilla
4341612 i think we have all the godzilla movies at home yet from the beginning he was a fantastic artist and he loved drawing and using cardboard and materials to make things he would see he was just fascinated by all of the names the costumes the fantasy of it all has always been a part of what he liked
4341613 in first grade mrs rhodina set up an easel in the back of the classroom and providing i finished my assignments she let me go in the back of the room and draw
4341614 that kind of thinking by a teacher early on was important when youre young you can so easily lose confidence about something creative like drawing but i found in my school system that creativity was supported and fostered along the way
4341615 this is the first job where ive used a computer at all
4341616 i got a shocking call out of the blue from someone at lucas company
4341617 i almost hung up on her i thought it was my friends having fun with me here i am three years later when i got here the studio had only eight people total now theres 75 plus people here and the company is worldwide with offices in singapore

4341622 weve all had great players at times but they take a long time
4341623 hey were going to run this route that weve never run before well it takes a whole week to get them used to the steps and different coverages and stuff
4341624 then there are people that you tell it to them one time and then all of a sudden they look like theyve been doing it forever he seems to be one of those guys so far
4341625 any time you get an athlete like that a playmaker guy you want to see what he can do
4341626 youre excited to have him and you want to get him in position to get his hands on the ball i think he can handle it
4341627 we had him doing too much and he wasnt as good a runner as he could be
4341628 he had some good things where he was catching the ball and everything else but we were doing all this stuff and we werent really getting his best
4341629 did so many things with him that first year he caught 80 balls and he was lining up all over the place all of a sudden hes getting like 3 2 yards a carry
4341630 the one thing you dont want to do is do so many things that he does nothing well
4341631 hes got to be really good at things before you do too much
4341632 its really up to him more than its up to us how far can he take it how many things can he master and do really well
4341633 you have your up days and you have your down days
4341634 its a joy to me because i played quarterback all the way up to my sophomore year of high school
4341635 today the risk is very small its a warning sign
4341636 could new devices be hackable we have no definitive evidence to suggest one way or the other but we expect the risks to increase as wireless ranges increase
4341637 its important to understand the risks so you can protect against them
4341638 today the chance of a patients implantable cardioverter defibrillator being reprogrammed by a malicious hacker is remote and the safety and benefit of these devices outweigh the current risk of this kind of interference
4341639 we think its important to think about these types of things
4341640 we dont want to leave ourselves and our patients vulnerable

4341642 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
4341643 a new field its just like a new car or a new anything youre going to have some problems
4341644 we did have a collapsed pipe underground we believe thats stopping the water from draining off the field in left field we put sand over it but its not a problem
4341645 wednesday was the first day that we had sunshine and the field was still wet as we figured that we were going to be able to go on it right away but as the time came closer and closer we realized that we had a wet left field and we had to take time out to put sand down so it would absorb the rain
4341646 the grass is a little slow because its a little damp
4341647 safety oh no we would not play baseball canada would not let the players play if it wasnt safe
4341648 well considering all the rain that you guys had theyre in pretty good shape honestly im surprised at the shape of the fields because i had a look at them wednesday morning they did a great job at both fields to get them ready
4341649 the grass doesnt have enough time to absorb anymore water but if we dont get anymore rain as we go along its going to get better and better
4341650 it doesnt affect it that much because the goal is to have the grass infield for the canada games we do play sometimes on dirt infields its not really an issue especially with the islands red clay
4341651 i would say we prefer to have lights but the schedule was built taking into consideration we only had that field with lights
4341652 i have four games that are really important the other three are placement games so if im stuck i wont play those games ill play my semifinals and my gold and my bronze thats my priority
4341653 unfortunately i have nothing to say about bryan at all

4341681 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4341682 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4341683 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4341684 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4341685 i think us 112 is still a key support level for oil

4341705 what makes him so remarkable is that he is willing to share his knowledge with anyone he does not keep anything to himself
4341706 even when he is not playing he remains the same person and personality i am blessed to be working with someone like percy this is a great week for him
4341707 what more can i say than it is wonderful to play in 100 test matches six springbok coaches selected percy and that says a lot
4341708 he is a wonderful role model and he looks after himself well it was always great to have players such as percy and
4341709 percys passion and loyalty to the springbok values are very strong he is serious about the traditions of springbok rugby

4341726 i see it as probably around the all star break when were really going to start coming together
4341727 i feel vin baker is being neglected in our offense and right now were also getting nothing out of the small forward position ainge said yesterday after learning the captain of his team spoke out for the second time in a week
4341728 somebody said to me that he proved me right he doesnt belong on our team
4341729 championship driven celts management only succeeded in driving the team into ruin because they couldnt wait to blow it up and start over

4341731 were losing three guys two veterans in eric williams and tony battie and its very painful
4341732 he was the mvp of the playoffs he led us to the promised land in game 7 of 84 to see him go out the way he did it really wasnt that good but i understand why max to a certain degree brought a lot of it on himself because he would say nonchalantly thats it boys lets close the books i think it got under larrys skin that he wasnt serious and red felt he lay down on him i just wish that all that could be forgiven and forgotten because there are two banners up there that he was a big part of he took the best offensive player night in and night out he was a pretty good other player i know red isnt going to go back on that not retiring maxwells number but in a real sense i wish he would red has been bitter about a lot of situations a lot of the time even though max did some things wrong at the end you dont just say he was a bad boy a bad kid we should really respond to the fact that he is a big reason why two banners are up there
4341733 if you look at the trade i think he really felt like i wouldnt mesh with these guys in dallas
4341734 i cant understand it unless he was trying to put me in a situation where he didnt want me to succeed
4341735 obviously hes going to ship me west thats obvious he didnt think individually id shine in dallas maybe team wise but if im putting up minimum numbers and im just an average player with this team he can live with that because he knows thats what hes going to get in return anyways with raef lafrentz
4341736 i feel vin baker is being neglected in our offense and right now were also getting nothing out of the small forward position
4341737 all of these small forwards we have are capable of producing something and they havent theres a lot more to be heard of from them than what were getting and its a matter of the whole team stepping up but we should be getting the ball more to vin
4341738 a lot of times guys depend on me to make a play they shouldnt depend on me so much i know i carry a heavy load but theres more they can do
4341739 a lot of stuff has to come from each individual everyone knows what has to be done rebounding hustle plays and were not doing it its not that were not playing hard everyone has to play tough mentally were too inconsistent right now

4341751 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4341752 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4341753 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended

4341776 he is clearly burning that many calories if he wasnt he would look chubby
4341777 its interesting if he wasnt eating that many calories he wouldnt be winning because he wouldnt have the energy
4341778 the carbs is what the body uses for energy you have to give the body glucose to fuel it thats why people on the atkins diet an all protein diet cant work out
4341779 its every part of the housing market thats getting whacked right now
4341780 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day

4341782 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4341783 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4341784 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4341785 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4341786 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4341787 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4341788 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4341789 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get eczema dermatitis rashes and so on it is too soon to say from this study people should stop moisturizing
4341790 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
4341791 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
4341792 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
4341793 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it
4341794 when something scares me there is always something i can do i can usually stop thinking about things that make me nervous or afraid if i try

4341836 one problem with liquor is that it is always the subject of a conscience vote in parliament
4341837 this does not help indeed it is hard to see why liquor should be the subject of a conscience vote the fact that it always has been in hardly a good reason
4341838 it there were not a conscience vote it would certainly assist in securing a coherent consistent and rational framework for dealing with a substance that imposes significant social costs on new zealand

4341852 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4341853 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4341854 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4341855 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4341856 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition

4341864 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4341865 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4341866 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4341867 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4341868 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4341869 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

4341873 role of molecular orbitals near the fermi level in the excitation of vibrational modes of a single molecule at a scanning tunneling microscope junction
4341874 this is the first observation of an indirect pathway of bond breaking which demonstrates the effective energy flow between two different vibrational modes
4341875 the fact that we can utilize a new indirect pathway to induce bond breaking could provide wider approaches for controlling and identifying surface chemical reactions

4341877 our family has always loved this house and appreciated the history of this house

4341883 i would think when you buy a house like that that you would try to preserve it
4341884 the wonderful energy of that house had less to do with the architecture and was more about the events that occurred there
4341885 when it was subdivided that sense of the house went away

4341968 essentially there is a gang of ten senators five republicans led by lindsey graham john thune saxby chambliss bob corker and johnny isaakson they joined five democrats to craft an energy bill in the senate that is exactly what barack obama wants it is an utter disaster
4341969 its a democrat giveaway the regulatory hurdles are huge they have expanded they are higher peta has a role the aclu has a role the bill bars drilling within 50 miles of the united states coastline that puts off limits some of the most productive areas even if the states allow it including in anwr well you can only drill in four states anyway under this bill but no you cant drill any closer to 50 miles of the coastline this deal would allow drilling if if and when the epa and peta and states and cities and counties and the aclu clear the way

4341974 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4341975 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4341976 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4341977 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4341978 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4341982 securing access to affordable and sustainable fuel underpins australias economy and way of life and as a nation with relatively high vehicle use we are vulnerable to the economic environmental and social impacts of rising oil prices and rising temperatures
4341983 in response to these challenges the forum believes australias fuel mix will shift in the near term to include the expanded use of diesel gaseous fuels such as lpg and hybrid electric vehicles with even greater diversity beyond 2020 that might include hydrogen synthetic fuels from coal or gas and advanced biofuels that will not impact food production
4341984 securing access to affordable and sustainable fuel underpins australias economy and way of life and as a nation with relatively high vehicle use we are vulnerable to the economic environmental and social impacts of rising oil prices and rising temperatures
4341985 the forums scenario modelling shows that if oil production peaks prices could climb as high as a 8 per litre by 2018 in the most extreme case this outcome could result in significant social impacts that are likely to adversely affect low income australians
4341986 results such as this could be seen as a catalyst for early action on the development and roll out of alternative fuel options low emission vehicle technologies and infrastructure that supports sustainable transport
4341987 the forum also modelled the inclusion of retail transport fuel in the emissions trading scheme and found prices are expected to be only moderately impacted an increase of around 10 cents per litre at a price of a 40 per tonne of carbon dioxide even with this relatively small impact our modelling indicates a steady shift towards low emission fuels and vehicles

4342147 we have about five or six guys right now we are trying to take a look at for those backup roles
4342148 but it is hard to say who is ahead of who because none of them have really been in many game situations so that makes it hard were just trying to get them as many reps as possible and see who responds to what
4342149 weve got talent there but it is all young or just inexperienced
4342150 the thing i like about this group is their work ethic they work hard they are asking questions they want to be good
4342151 but the thing is until the games start we really wont have a good idea of who is getting it and who needs more time so that can cause some nerves because once those lights come on all bets are off
4342152 the reality is were going to need to spell adam and scott and shane so some of these guys need to step up quickly and i believe it is a good enough group that by the time the games start we will have a good rotation

4342163 these guys just need playing time said bochy who planned to start a good portion of them today in atlanta
4342164 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now

4342166 what michael is doing it makes the rest of us look like
4342167 i wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters and try to get out to an early lead he said
4342168 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on thats all i wanted to do

4342196 the steadily rising value of the u s dollar the significant reduction in demand that has occurred particularly in north america and europe and the relatively calm global geo political scene experienced as of late have all contributed to this pronounced deflation in crude trading values
4342197 while in general the fall of crude has resulted in lower refined product prices over the past month recently gasoline spot market prices have moved in the opposite direction as refiners react to reduced margins continued high input costs and a shrinking market

4342210 retail sales should continue to grow in the coming months albeit at a slower pace
4342211 they still need to clothe themselves they still need to eat they still need to have some fun sometimes
4342212 retailers and developers have to have a discussion about consumers

4342217 the last year really went by fast said dunphy gotell who is vice president of the media community relations and communications division for the 2009 canada games
4342218 they know really the issues they are concerned about for their athletes she said
4342219 so it was somewhat of a test to make sure we were in ready position but at the same time those conferences were really a great way of knowing that we were ready for the games
4342220 you started to have to let it go and have faith and trust in the volunteers that were executing the job dunphy gotell said of passing the torch as the 1991 games approached
4342221 and i know we had sessions like day sessions to talk to the volunteers to make sure that they were looking after everything
4342222 the invitation to come play at our games is for the athletes for the volunteers for the parents for the friends he said
4342223 and i think that is one of the major legacies from the 09 canada games is the facilities that will be left behind for training she said
4342224 we are very excited that in just one short year we will be hosting the canada summer games in prince edward island for the first time ever she said

4342227 when a physician makes the decision to have a patient transferred to a facility outside the province for specialized care financial concern should not be an issue for the patient or their families said ghiz
4342228 our government recognizes that ambulance transfer services to other facilities outside the province should be funded as part of the public health system and we are delivering on our promise to islanders
4342229 is this related to the fact that they will be closing down oleary and alberton hospital emergency rooms because of the shortage of doctors crane asked
4342230 from what i hear a number of doctors are telling patients that they are probably going to have to leave

4342318 however what i have heard mccain say several times is that he for for equal opportunities for all he speaks out against affirmative action because it does not promote equal opportunity for everyone
4342319 when i see an opponent of affirmative action give me an alternative where the minority isnt on the short end of the stick perhaps ill take him more seriously
4342320 why i say abortion is not a woman issue is because i feel it is a freedom and liberty issue to be shared by men and women together

4342339 what this ordinance does is it takes away the voice of the person whos trying to get recognition for what theyre doing
4342340 you have to find out who the actual owner is you have to get permission its amazing just to make sure that its done legally and correctly so this will shorten that up and will be able to cover more area in less time
4342341 i do not have a problem with serial numbers its a good idea it needs to be done id rather catch the bad guy but i would like better cooperation with police is that possible heres what happens three policemen came in about a month ago walked in and said i want that tool that tool and that tool the customer said thats mine thats mine and thats mine they picked up the items took them no serial numbers no ids no nothing
4342342 you know whenever we get some complaints i want to know what they are i want to understand them and just investigate and find out if theyre valid and if we need to change the way we do business well change the way we do business
4342343 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4342344 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4342345 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4342346 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4342347 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4342348 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4342349 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4342350 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4342351 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4342352 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4342353 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4342354 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4342355 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4342356 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4342357 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4342358 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4342359 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4342360 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4342361 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4342362 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4342363 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4342364 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4342365 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4342366 i dont see this team ever leaving this is a great hockey market
4342367 its been a long time coming its something thats exciting for all of us
4342368 it was a painful process but the end result was worth it
4342369 i cant wait to sit on one of those seats in the new arena
4342370 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4342371 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4342372 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4342373 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4342374 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4342375 but but but but we need him for the big issue 500 extravaganza
4342376 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
4342377 this is about hundreds of thousand of individuals whose lives are being taken maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about whose comments and statements but now lets devote all our efforts to resolving a situation that is fraught with tragedy

4342386 confrontational rhetoric notwithstanding russias leaders are conscious of their strategic limitations indeed i would characterize russian policy under putin as driven in a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice but the movement of the western security system from the elbe river to the approaches to moscow brings home russias decline in a way bound to generate a russian emotion that will inhibit the solution of all other issues it should be kept on the table without forcing the issue to determine the possibilities of making progress on other issues

4342389 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4342390 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4342391 one of the assumptions for the future in iraq was that coalition contributions would remain relatively stable
4342392 this is the third largest contingent and a very capable contingent this changes the calculus
4342393 if you had to assess the 30 countries in iraq as a coalition force georgia was among the top tier both in number and capabilities
4342394 they were beginning to establish some real capability along the border to help ramp up iraqi security forces and slow down the iranian flows of illegal arms across the border

4342406 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4342407 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4342408 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4342409 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4342410 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4342411 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4342412 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4342413 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4342450 all the completely irrelevant personal information people post i have no patience for reading about what someone is barbecuing
4342451 i think it has great potential if people use it to track inputs around specific topics say educators in a twitter group who share tidbits from ed tech books they are reading talk about great purchase deals or even do simple tech q amp a

4342460 a dog providing assistance to a person with a disability
4342461 being partnered with a service dog has opened my eyes to a gross misunderstanding throughout the general public regarding service dogs the rights and priveleges a sd team is entitled to and the unique benefits these canine angels bestow upon their disabled partners
4342462 my goal with canine and abled is to evoke tolerance of the disabled something that is sorely lacking in todays society i know in my heart that people would not say rude things or deny access to disabled persons who rely upon service dogs if only they had insight of what these dogs do for us and what life is like for a partnered team
4342463 canine and abled has been launched in schools businesses civic associations and the like and has received many accolades from audiences everywhere it has also gained much attention in the media of late and has been a great opportunity to promote awareness
4342464 its so very important for me to spread my message far and wide i cant begin to tell you how an access challenge affects a person who relies so completely upon their service dog education means open doors and open doors mean freedom something our service dogs have so generously and selflessly given back to us

4342516 who are we as men to say to janice and these other women that we are called but not you
4342517 this is a big issue for me i feel we are tampering with the sacred that we are in a way overwriting gods call who are we to say that our call as men is valid your call as women is not valid
4342518 ive come to the realization that women could be ordained in our catholic church
4342519 but i do believe in this issue enough that i cannot be silent
4342520 they were not consulted prior to his participation nor would they have condoned it

4342523 international markets such as russia far east and middle east
4342524 are looking to collect jewelry and are realizing and appreciating jewelry as an art form
4342525 lately there have been less of these pieces on the market
4342526 and as a result the value has shot up to almost double or triple estimates
4342527 with estate jewelry the customer tends to approach the product as a collector rather than a consumer not only as a beautiful object but as something that could appreciate in value over time
4342528 people think they are getting a deal at an auction house

4342536 i cant even remember what i had for breakfast thats what boxing is doing to my head
4342537 is to be the first one on the field the last one off it so far so good
4342538 the whole training camp was supposed to be a disaster the high performance programme was no good there was too much training being done all a load of pony
4342539 this is all about trial and error and i was happy to be part of the old system under the iaba and now the high performance programme were getting everything we need now the training camps the competition and thats the only way forward
4342540 if youre going to score and not get them theres a chance of being overturned here kenny landed shots very cleanly in the second round i think everyone in the stadium saw them except the five guys sitting down around the ring
4342541 or at least three of them didnt see it at the same time anyway but it is worrying because it was 2 1 at that stage landing five clean shots and not getting them can break your heart
4342542 if i throw a good punch and nothing happens you can hear a bit of cursing and thats in your head if youre after landing a punch and its not coming up on the screen
4342543 but when you hear the cheering you know youre doing something right its good to have them there because it gives you a fair idea of what score you are
4342544 were in the gym all the time six days a week training so hard all for those eight minutes in the ring
4342545 its nonsense because its all on the day youve seen it yourself the last week with all the world champions getting beaten here theres actually three of them gone out of the tournament now so the head is the most important thing if thats right youre laughing its a big jigsaw but the biggest piece is upstairs
4342546 we always felt we were capable of doing it but the head part is the key part once kenny was right in that department he was in control from the very beginning
4342547 but the stakes are getting higher again now the brazilian is very strong hell go for four rounds kenny has all the talent on him but hes got to bring it to the table if hes not going to be scoring hes going to struggle and this guy has a tight defence
4342548 oh ah ya dawn can you also bring that bread
4342549 no bones about it if i could convince bruce to join aeg and join the galaxy hed be the ideal guy to come in here
4342550 theres not a better candidate theres not a better potential coach he knows more about the game i have more respect mr anschutz has great respect for bruce so wed be honored to have him
4342551 you dont look at a guy like bruce as a contender
4342552 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation tonight was really geared toward his input toward and his feelings towards what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4342553 in my opinion you have to look at bruce and believe that this is the best coach that this league has ever had
4342554 i dont think hes lost anything so it would be fantastic for this franchise if we could convince bruce to join us here but as i said we have a ways to go before were going to know whether or not thats the direction we or he are going in
4342555 we owe the team and the fans a quick conclusion to this process

4342561 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4342562 i cant believe you havent asked me how im doing no you were only concerned about kenya well sadie was my best friend too
4342563 i havent heard from you or seen you since she died its like ive lost two friends
4342564 i just didnt know what to say i didnt want to say the wrong thing in these sensitive times i never been through anything like this before so i didnt know
4342565 shes my sister of course i did but i didnt talk to her about this i kept changing the subject trying to get her mind off of it
4342566 why do you always sound like youre jealous of my relationship with my sister
4342567 jealous im not jealous i just can not stand kenya johnson and she feels the same way about me we have a love hate relationship she knows shes my girl but at a distance
4342568 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time

4342581 my round was well managed and i think that if you had to pinpoint something it was distance control so when i was uncomfortable with a certain hole location and there are going to be some of those on this course i was able to just hit the ball in the middle of the green and then give myself an easy two putt
4342582 it was one of those rounds that when i had to a hole six eight 10 footer for par i did

4342606 the idea of reorienting the economy from the priority of heavy industry to the priority of consumer goods converting even heavy industrial enterprises to at least partial production of goods in popular demand
4342607 the issue of the poor quality and lack of variety of consumer goods beginning in 1954
4342608 the mass media began to show increased interest in readers feedback
4342609 began to reserve special columns for the publication of readers letters
4342610 a new emphasis on audience differentiation and feedback mechanisms in print and broadcast media
4342611 soviet industry remained notoriously deficient in terms of the quantity and the quality of its output the result as everyone knows was a mushrooming of the shadow economy and of a substantial black market trade in western goods and scarce soviet items plus a boom in corruption

4342662 that was my favorite pair and i wanted to wear those today so that i could have luck finding a date to that dance thingie
4342663 paws my darling what brings you here so early on this saturday morning
4342664 hows about you wait outside for the rest of us to get dressed and we will let you in to chat in a few minutes mmmkay alright see you in a bit
4342665 you better have a good reason for giving me the drastic escape plan h face
4342666 well isnt it obvious why she did look extremely hot if i may say so myself
4342667 why did you give james the drastic escape plan g face
4342668 but i bet now that you say that something will happen
4342669 your just being silly marie just relax and stop freaking out about something that hasent even happened
4342670 shes probably dosing she did wake us at five in the morning
4342671 if the wind had come in a different direction i might not be
4342672 si al final de todo esto no est s tu la vida no tendr el mismo sentido
4342673 how good is a phone call when you cant speak
4342674 how good is the iphone 3g when there is no 3g network in the country
4342675 besides this special consideration for bsnl and mtnl 3g bwa spectrum would be allocated through an auction process to be conducted by a specialised agency for the spectrum blocks released to them bsnl and mtnl will pay a price equal to the highest bid in the respective service areas
4342676 3g will do a lot more than just offering services on the iphone and other 3g phones available in the market so definitely there will be limited spectrum for the operators and as you ask if someone any of the operators dont get the 3g spectrum then they will either go for some deals or acquisitions to acquire the 3g spectrum
4342677 mergers will not be allowed during the initial five years no trading reselling of spectrum is allowed
4342678 there will be roll out obligations to avoid spectrum hoarding if licensee does not achieve its roll out obligations it shall be given one year to do so on payment of 2 5 percent of its successful auction bid i e spectrum acquisition price per quarter or part thereof if licensee does not complete its roll out obligations even within this one year the spectrum assignment shall stand withdrawn the roll out requirements including rural roll out as well as stiff penalties for non compliance of the same has been stipulated
4342679 but looking at the popularity of pre paid services in india i think there will be more pre paid services and there can be subsidised iphones as well in india
4342680 the worst think is currently no international player in interested in 3g auction of india reason being the market structure 2g is very strong in india and it will take up a lot of resources to build up the 3g infrastructure also the business model is not tested so right now it will be interesting to see how current players take leverage of the infrastructure and presence and build the business so in the current situation it is easier for local players to build on top of that pricing and presence of many small players in various reasons is another reason for that
4342681 yes that will be a disappointment for users as there is no 3g in india and they will not be able to get the best out of iphone 3g
4342682 well until there is 3g network in india you wont be able to reap benefits of 3g so in a way you are right
4342683 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4342684 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4342685 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4342686 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4342687 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race

4342690 on december 7 1975 indonesia secretly but with the complicity of the western powers including the us the uk and australia invaded the small nation of east timor two australian television crews attempting to document the invasion were murdered
4342691 when i started screaming he run to my living room
4342692 he comes up behind me and grabs me around the neck and i stand up and knocked him back a bit
4342693 i pushed my cigarette toward him and he just ran away
4342694 he could become more violent next time you dont know whats going on in this guys head hes obviously sick

4342716 the clash has started again this morning friday and is still in progress
4342717 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline
4342718 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
4342719 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online

4342722 which i want to read i guess i was most alarmed by the fact that he thought i was saying its okay to be racist im not its not he tends to be a contrarian asshole at times so i think he was just trying to make me feel like an idiot
4342723 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4342724 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4342725 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4342726 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union

4342733 being down two match points and the other guys serve youre never really feeling good
4342734 but looking back i might have needed a tough match like this
4342735 i saw that and i dont know if thats a game hes completely comfortable with
4342736 i knew if i could make him play stick to that game i probably had a decent shot at the breaker
4342737 i played a horrible service game the next one and somehow got through it
4342738 i felt like i was on the verge of doing a lot of the right things tonight
4342739 when you can take someones best and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and fight them off and finally three hours later get the win its a good feeling

4342742 full understanding of fibromyalgia requires comprehensive assessment of pain function and psychosocial context fibromyalgia should be recognised as a complex and heterogeneous condition where there is abnormal pain processing and other secondary features
4342743 optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach with a combination of non pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities tailored according to pain intensity function associated features such as depression fatigue and sleep disturbance in discussion with the patient
4342744 heated pool treatment with or without exercise is effective in fibromyalgia
4342745 individually tailored exercise programmes including aerobic exercise and strength training can be beneficial to some patients
4342746 aerobic only training has beneficial effects on physical function and some fm symptoms strength only training may improve fm symptoms but requires further study
4342747 cognitive behavioural therapy may be of benefit to some patients with fibromyalgia
4342748 other therapies such as relaxation rehabilitation physiotherapy and psychological support may be used depending on the needs of the individual patient iib c

4342754 we hope local school leaders board members teachers parents and students will closely analyze these scores to identify local students academic strengths and weaknesses
4342755 we dont want this information to collect dust on a shelf but rather be used in a strategic manner to improve course offerings and college preparedness of local high school students
4342756 our teachers administrators and students should be commended for their continued efforts and performance
4342757 i am extremely pleased with what is going on not only in our classrooms but advisement areas counselors guiding them in the classes that will prepare them for the act
4342758 our pta makes a concentrated effort to bring jack carville to bring preparation for act and they have taken that on as a project for several years now
4342759 i think thats made a big difference to get some assistance and understanding and test taking tips
4342760 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4342761 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4342762 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4342763 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4342764 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4342765 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4342766 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4342767 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4342768 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4342769 its something thats on your mind and you train for that kind of thing
4342770 we wanted to see what the city and the county have to say about it
4342771 were certainly a lot smaller and since the united launch alliance are the only guys in town they dont have to be very responsive to commercial launches
4342772 there is no safe passage for him now he is asking for safe passage after selling out pakistans sovereignty
4342773 i am not a revenge seeker its not about me it is about the whole country
4342774 in my opinion her honour did not err as alleged
4342775 her honour did not as the appellant suggested pay mere lip service to the requirement to compare the two offenders by referring to the principle only to ignore it
4342776 rather she made a comprehensive comparative analysis of all relevant circumstances and concluded the offenders were not like in any respect apt to attract the parity principle
4342777 ich habe die augen zugemacht und bin nur mein rennen geschwommen ich kann es noch gar nicht fassen beim anschlag habe ich nur die libby gesehen dann habe ich auf die anzeigetafel geschaut und es realisiert
4342778 das ist ein wahnsinnsgef hl ich habe nie gedacht dass mir dieser letzte durchbruch gelingt
4342779 vor dem rennen hat mein trainer norbert warnatzsch gesagt dass ich keine experimente machen und die ruhe bewahren soll
4342780 mit uns ist auch nach den ausf llen zu rechnen wir stehen fast sicher im viertelfinale dort geht es dann erst richtig los uns darf man nicht abschreiben

4342786 wisconsin seniors cannot afford the bush mccain plan to gamble away social security on wall street
4342787 on the anniversary of social security the seniors of this state will not allow senator mccain to jeopardize the most successful anti poverty program ever enacted
4342788 senator mccain is again pushing george bushs plan even after americans rejected his earlier attempts to privatize social security and put profits ahead of families
4342789 we need to send a message to john mccain that wisconsin does not want to gamble away our retirement security on the stock market
4342790 i propose a straight up season series challenge win more games against us including any potential playoff games and snakepit day will return to the row next year
4342791 runs such as the rockies almost always happen when a team is in a multiple season success cycle its incredibly rare for mediocre teams to put together such streaks
4342792 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
4342793 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters
4342794 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
4342795 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
4342796 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
4342797 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
4342798 y todo lo que puedan pensar que tiene un pa s acaudalado lo tiene liberia
4342799 es una de las personas m s fina que pueda conocer en su g nero
4342800 fue la primera mujer electa en frica es un reconocimiento que hacemos como gobierno
4342801 hay electores que votan en un lugar distinto al que indica su c dula esto se viene arrastrando desde las elecciones del a o 2002
4342802 por ejemplo los estados unidos provee inteligencia a diario para los operativos antinarc ticos don a la marina de guerra de la rep blica dominicana a trav s del programa amistad duradera cuatro lanchas interceptoras y equipos de comunicaci n y entrenamientos valorados en us 7 5 millones
4342803 uno de estos programas est dirigido a darle seguimiento a los casos de lavado de dinero y el a o pasado m s de us 100 millones en bienes obtenidos de manera il cita fueron confiscados
4342804 so what they dont teach history in schools anyway what matters is managing opinion and consensus
4342805 right now they are evacuating cities due to the poisoning but this is not often reported in our news
4342806 you know you were the smart one you left and are still strong enough to fight you kept your perception clear i have nothing to show but academic papers that will be forgotten and that i despise mostly and you know the worst part my colleagues envy me keep the faith i mean that
4342807 dont you see this is 1984 we are living this film were in the film
4342808 the us in 2001 where she predicted what we have today police bursting into homes cant win laws and above all prices of 2 for a mcdonalds hamburger and rattle trap cars with sexy outer design for 40 000 she had a battle royal to keep from being flunked
4342809 theres something materialist about hitting us with logic at the start of a logic class
4342810 magistrado y a d nde voy no conozco la direcci n de mi casa
4342811 la duda finalmente se me disip cuando vi junto al emblema de los juegos ol mpicos un logo que cerraba el cartel dfk korean foundation
4342812 es que aqu en este extra o pa s tambi n hay una agrupaci n de seguidores de demian aqu tambi n lleg su obra entonces es un grosso en serio tome esta foto con mi celular porque me pareci que ustedes podr an a partir de esto obtener respuestas a mis interrogantes y a los que sin dudas les iban a surgir a ustedes al leer el mail
4342813 me voy a estados unidos en espa a no encuentro gente de mi edad y de mi estilo que le guste entrenarse a mi altura y all tendr una salida para conseguir mi objetivo que no es otro que prepararme bien todos los d as
4342814 necesito estar en un equipo que tenga un plan fuerte de entrenamientos donde haya competitividad que te ayude a mejorar
4342815 la federaci n espa ola y los t cnicos lo han entendido en ning n momento han puesto pegas
4342816 si quieres llegar al primer nivel hay que dar todo todo d a a d a
4342817 la polic a viene a inspeccionar por eso los escondemos
4342818 no hay mucho negocio a causa de los juegos la polic a viene de vez en cuando a inspeccionar por eso los tenemos escondidos adem s hay pocos turistas
4342819 desde junio la polic a no nos deja vender pel culas extranjeras el negocio va muy mal
4342820 escriba una lista con las pel culas que quiere y vuelva en un par de d as
4342821 aqu no hay problema pero no tenemos las ltimas pel culas no las recibiremos hasta que acaben los juegos
4342822 por eso opt por hacer mi propia carrera sin pensar en batir el r cord del mundo
4342823 en lo primero que pens al ver que hab a ganado fue en m mismo
4342824 cuando se deshizo el colegio de comisarios despu s de dar los resultados oficiales el plazo ya se cerr
4342825 adem s s lo tenemos esa prueba las im genes que no puede ser definitiva ya que ni nosotros ni nadie pod a acceder antes de la salida a la zona en la que el comisario med a y pesaba las bicicletas de los corredores
4342826 el punto de apoyo de las manos deber situarse en una zona delimitada como sigue por encima por la horizontal que pasa por el plano horizontal de apoyo del sill n
4342827 es todo una falsa impresi n leipheimer por su elasticidad es capaz de agarrar el acople del manillar s lo con los dos dedos me iques y por eso puede casi introducir la cabeza entre las manos todo muy junto pero el manillar es perfectamente legal ya lo us en junio en la dauphin lib r sin ning n problema
4342828 s pero s lo vi im genes televisadas de un corredor en movimiento y desde ngulos diferentes
4342829 para juzgar sobre la conformidad de un manillar hay que situarse al lado de la bicicleta cuando el corredor no est montado si le han dejado participar ser porque el comisario que la ha examinado no ha apreciado nada extra o por lo tanto habr que confiar en su criterio
4342830 y no de ninguna manera forzaremos la posibilidad de una reclamaci n que nos puede generar finalmente m s problemas que beneficios
4342831 cuando nos dimos la vuelta para irnos del podio me sent con una enorme fuerza la de un hombre libre al que nunca m s podr an poner grilletes
4342832 tengo la obligaci n de mantener y potenciar lo conseguido esp ritu cohesi n de grupo y humildad
4342833 no tiene las puertas cerradas pero hemos cre do m s oportuno no traerlo
4342834 amorebieta de 23 a os es un central zurdo r pido y de potencia
4342835 hemos querido que aporten sangre nueva en este nuevo proceso
4342836 hemos analizado a espa a en los ltimos a os y vamos a tocar lo menos posible respetamos los automatismos y la coordinaci n
4342837 no he sabido estar a la altura y me he lleva una gran decepci n he sacrificado toda la temporada para hacerlo bien en los juegos ol mpicos y no he sabido hacer una buena calificaci n
4342838 por dar un dato me parece que he hecho pr cticamente la mismamarca que en pista cubierta para m ha sido un gran golpe
4342839 he hecho un primer lanzamiento a asegurar para hacerlo v lido un segundo que se me ha escapado de la mano y en el tercero he tenido buenas sensaciones pens que era de m s de veinte metros y sin embargo nada m s que fue de 19 80 por lo tanto no he sabido estar a la altura
4342840 ahora mismo no lo s ha sido algo muy fuerte para m ten a puestas muchas ilusiones y no me llevaba una desilusi n tan grande desde hace muchos a os
4342841 cada uno sabe en cada momento en la posici n en la que est y hoy no era mi posici n el veinte del mundo
4342842 tengo que ver cu les son mis posibilidades y como he dicho m s de una vez a o a a o plantearme si voy a seguir compitiendo tengo que tener ilusi n y ganas de continuar porque estar en la alta competici n es algo muy dif cil se necesita mucho esfuerzo y se sacrifican muchas cosas por ejemplo llevo sin ver a mis hijas un mes y medio y es sacrificado
4342843 este tipo de cosas la gente no las ve y son importantes tienen un gran valor llevo diecis is a os en la alta competici n y muy pocos lanzadores a nivel mundial pueden decir eso
4342844 despu s de tantos a os de competici n sobre todo en el concurso completo no hay ning n rival que me ponga presi n
4342845 es una oportunidad perdida otras m s igual que en atenas
4342846 ahora cualquier paciente puede pedirlo en espa a a trav s de un servicio de farmacia
4342847 est n buscando otra opci n que bien controlada puede dar resultados positivos en algunos pacientes
4342848 se sigue investigando y autorizando su uso compasivo o como medicamento extranjero a petici n de especialistas y de un hospital porque no se necesita la misma evidencia para autorizar una soliciud individual para un paciente concreto sin otra alternativa que para autorizar un medicamento con una indicaci n general
4342849 prueba que los grupos de c digo abierto pueden proteger su c digo bajo las leyes de derechos de autor y es un fallo que pueden utilizar otros grupos de c digo abierto
4342850 sufrir una lesi n as te ayuda a relativizar las cosas
4342851 jorge necesitaba meter esos triples y decir aqu estoy yo
4342852 a nosotros no ten a que demostrarnos nada porque lo vemos en el d a a d a y sabemos que est bien pero necesitaba meter esos triples y decir aqu estoy yo
4342853 me gusta que entren los tiros pero no es lo que m s me preocupa me preocupan mis sensaciones servir al equipo
4342854 sabemos que nos falta un punto de chispa de brillantez pero el equipo saca los partidos adelante cada d a con un par de jugadores que est n bien
4342855 lo importante es llegar al campeonato a un 80 o un 85 e ir creciendo hay cosas que corregir pero mientras tengamos que hacerlo despu s de una victoria mucho mejor
4342856 desde los ltimos juegos de atenas no hab a jugado ning n partido a esta hora
4342857 ha sido extra o para todos creo que no ha sido para tirar cohetes pero podemos estar satisfechos por c mo ha salido el partido
4342858 fue una sensaci n infantil como hacer bien los deberes
4342859 la edad de oro de los marchadores est entre los 31 y los 35 a os
4342860 mi papel consiste ahora en hablar con l e instruirle m s que en el entrenamiento
4342861 pero ahora a los 31 a os entra en la edad de oro
4342862 lo dif cil lo que no es normal es jugar la cantidad de partidos que hemos jugado entre los dos contra djokovic en semifinales s lo me bastar n las mejores formas es el gran especialista en esta superficie junto con federer y perd con l hace una semana en cincinnati conseguir una medalla sea la que sea ser a impresionante
4342863 era una de mis metas de la temporada no he tenido tiempo de entrenarme bien desde febrero me puedo culpar a m mismo por no haberme tomado tiempo para eso y no haber jugado cincinnati y toronto
4342864 ya no me puedo esconder por debajo del radar los n meros uno del mundo est n en los titulares cuando pierden quiz s por eso todo esto parece un poco m s extremo de lo que es

4342873 hillary clintons campaign made history this year with 18 million women and men across the country voting for her in the primaries
4342874 and she will make history yet again when delegates from nearly every state in the nation will be able to take the floor and proudly say clintons name in the roll call vote
4342875 women will not be fully equal until we break every last glass ceiling
4342876 hillary clinton proved that electing a woman president is within our grasp having her delegates tallied at the convention will ensure that this important step in history will never be forgotten

4342878 we are working diligently to make university of the west the preeminent location for the academic study of buddhism
4342879 the development of the inter faith master of divinity program at uwest is the product of intense collaboration with hospital based clinical pastoral education programs christian and buddhist denominations and eminent theologians from the united states and abroad
4342880 we are looking forward to a new way of meeting the ministry needs of a new generation
4342881 the significance of wasc approval means other institutions are far more likely to recognized the program and employers as well
4342882 anybody can give out degrees accreditation affirms that our peers in the world of academic learning and professional training have recognized us
4342883 one of the obstacles for buddhists seeking certification as professional chaplains is the lack of accredited graduate training programs
4342884 the program here at uwest is important because it helps to solve this problem and encourage the professional development of buddhist chaplains
4342885 a two year on campus residency requirement is vital for chaplaincy training
4342886 since an indispensible part of being an effective chaplain is good interpersonal skills this residency requirement will allow uwest to evaluate and help students develop these skills
4342887 if we called it a dbs no one would know what it is m div immediately tells everyone you ve studied chaplaincy

4342893 the investments were most heavily concentrated in resource and infrastructure industries including coal mining oil exploration and railway infrastructure this boom in investment was likely fueled by post earthquake reconstruction and the rebuilding of infrastructure following the severe snowstorms that afflicted southern china in february

4342901 i think most people that have a disability should be dead the ones that contribute nothing they are like that cause they have bad genes recessive genes and keeping them alive and letting them breed is stupid and tropic blunder what a retarded slogan

4342911 i am really excited about coming over to manchester and playing all my favourite dylan tracks as well as my own stuff it looks like a great line up for the weekend
4342912 we wanted to do something to mark bob dylans infamous concert just over forty two years ago at manchesters free trade hall where he was called a judas for going electric by a member of the audience a bootleg recording of the concert was released in 1998 and we thought it would be an ideal opportunity to mark its tenth anniversary bob is seen by all acoustic artists as the god of acoustic music and the response from artists wanting to take part in the festival weekend has been fantastic we have acts coming from all over the uk and as far away as ireland to perform at the event he has a universal appeal to people of all ages
4342913 its alright ma im only bleeding achieved new heights and others like
4342914 he didnt care about what you were he cared about who you were
4342915 he was part of our brand hes part of what makes denver the west
4342916 he was somebody who just by being in the room helped everyone feel better
4342917 he believed in self reliance but also in the value of community
4342918 he believed in business ethics long before it became a buzzword
4342919 he was just funny as anything and really created a tremendous legacy in this town she enjoyed seeing him every st patricks day in mccormicks restaurant
4342920 he always had a twinkle in his eye and told these great jokes usually at the expense of democrats

4342928 when dylan went electric in the summer of 1965 he helped create folk rock along with the byrds version of his mr tambourine man thats when he really started to have an important impact on fans outside of the world of folk music
4342929 what i admire about dylan the most is that he does not cater to the public
4342930 even if a decision is unpopular he never wavers and this is what makes dylan dylan
4342931 dylans songs have always been an important part of my repertoire no matter what style i play he understood how music needs to be rooted in the vernacular and that kind of connection has always been in the heart of my love of music
4342932 just recently i played every grain of sand with some friends around the campfire and it was powerful you could sense his words resonating in all of us
4342933 the thing about dylan over the years is just when you think youve got him figured out he changes
4342934 the guy just refused to be pinned down or pigeon holed you gotta respect that
4342935 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be

4342954 near a packed football stadium using an explosive attached to his body
4342955 the way the attack was conducted is very much similar to previous attacks throughout the years at el al counters therefore unfortunately given this history we presume that it may and would appear to be a terrorist attack
4342956 the terrorists deliberately chose the fourth of july to carry out their crime on the soil of the united states
4342957 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter
4342958 with so many netbooks now available which is the best one out there im mostly concerned with getting the best bang for my buck so im not too interested in any of those higher end units
4342959 but at the same time most of the people that are out there are out there because they love the work and they want to be there
4342960 it is difficult not to feel a wee bit vulnerable when an armed convoy cruises by
4342961 there are military vehicle convoys that traverse the city roads on a regular basis generally traffic making way for the convoys to travel through as the convoys are often the primary target for suicide attacks etc
4342962 its high energy and high stimulation youre up close and personal with life situations that consume you and i think theres no other job like that
4342963 every day theres something else that gives you a sense of inspiration
4342964 just imagine youre in a refugee camp with 150 000 people
4342965 you get this idea i cant deal with this sometimes you have to make the decision this persons not going to eat today
4342966 you do reach a point with yourself where you really have to recognize im not behaving normally the stress is getting to me
4342967 you really go through a struggle to reintegrate yourself into your own society
4342968 obama sleeps with a teddy bear and a night light
4342969 its not that the media are doing a bad job covering these issues but rather that gender stereotypes are pervading the way we talk about mental illness for better or for worse
4342970 but at the same time many articles implied that people who dont adhere to these stereotypes need to be medicated
4342971 the puc is responsible for protecting the people who are most susceptible to the heat and cant pay the outrageous electric bills that deregulation is requiring
4342972 we dont have the good luck of mild weather like last year
4342973 there may be an increase in august with the higher rates going into effect
4342974 when you compare the number of billings to the amount of disconnects it is about 0 7 percent
4342975 and the vast majority of people who are disconnected come up with the funds to get their electricity turned back on
4342976 the legislature came within minutes of passing a bill to provide disconnection protections last year
4342977 the fact that we have to ask the puc to adopt this emergency protection only highlights the need for a legislative solution for this continuing problem
4342978 we have a fiscal responsibility to collect the funds so that it doesnt become a financial burden for the rest of our customers

4342983 customers will be able to ask questions and touch the fabrics and representatives will be available to answer the dos and donts of this season

4342989 apa yang saya fikir yang paling jelas adalah akta hasutan saya fikir itu cukup jelas dan dua kali mereka majlis peguam telah buat forum terbuka
4342990 dan sekali lagi dia buat saya fikir kita jangan dayus untuk tidak mengenakan akta hasutan kepada pemimpin berkenaan
4342991 jangan sesiapa berani sentuh perkara 121 dan 153 dalam perlembagaan dalam hal ini tidak ada kompromi
4342992 kenapa mereka kurang ajar kenapa majlis peguam mahu menyentuh soal kedudukan orang melayu
4342993 melayu itu adalah islam islam itu adalah melayu dalam perlembagaan di malaysia
4342994 hentikanlah sebut perkara perkara sensitif tentang orang melayu dan agama islam kalau tidak mahu orang melayu menggunakan perkataan amuk semula seperti termaktub dalam kamus oxford dan kamus kamus lain
4342995 beliau sebagai pemimpin harus sedar bahawa apa kata kata yang terlontar adalah tanggungjawab beliau sendiri jangan salahkan media dalam perkara ini
4342996 apa perlu bincang perkara ini termaktub dalam akta uitm sendiri saya tidak fikir oleh kerana uitm berada di bumi selangor maka menjadi haknya mencadangkan perkara itu
4342997 daripada segi implikasi perundangan tidak perlu difikirkan tetapi itu daripada segi hukum allah mesti dihormati

4343001 weve also discussed it with other providers and weve found that it is becoming more and more common that people are running vacancies in the low care section

4343007 thats unheard of its just not done that way in international basketball or even domestic basketball i thought it was very poor on the part of the czechs to pour it on new zealand the way they did at the end
4343008 the way the usa have played over the last several olympics and with this team they have here this year i hate to say it but the only way that new zealand wins that game is if the united states bus breaks down on the way to the gymnasium

4343065 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4343066 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4343067 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4343068 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4343104 theyre the bullies of the operating room the brow beaters of bedside manner doctors nurses and other clinicians who make a habit of behaving badly
4343105 they yell they cuss they throw things or they engage in more subversive behaviors ignoring questions acting impatient insulting colleagues or speaking to them in condescending tones
4343106 its a problem that goes underreported threatens patient safety and has become so ingrained in healthcare that its rarely talked about
4343107 about 70 of nurses studied believe theres a link between disruptive behavior and adverse outcomes and nearly 25 percent said there was a direct tie between the bad acts and patient mortality
4343108 you know what that doesnt work here and were going to have to do this together
4343109 drive by shootings gang warfare gun crime and lethal saturated fats alan parkers kiddie gangster pastiche might have been tailor made to exorcise the twenty first century daily mail yet when it was released in 1976 critics decided it was too cute for school they knew nothing parkers feature debut described by the director as the work of a madman is an audacious parody of prohibition era pulp fiction that throws gravel in the face of bonnet wearing 1970s british childrens dramas like the railway children by refusing to accept its a kids film at all in a plot that wouldnt fill the first chapter of a dime store pulp thriller bugsy malone scott baio is the genial scamster recruited by bar owner fat sam john cassisi to help in the war against dandy dan martin lev and his gang who have come up with a lethal new custard pie delivery system the splurge gun bugsy also steals the heart of wannabe starlet blousey brown florrie dugger but pouting in the shadows is the almost inappropriately seductive singer tallulah jodie foster fresh if thats the word from taxi driver baio with happy days still to look forward to makes a winsome little lead while cassisi and lev neither of whom would act again me sufferer lev committed suicide in 1992 are as promising and unaffected as their cotton mouthed accents allow bonnie langford is wisely kept away from fosters untouchable teenage vamp and a cherubic nine year old dexter fletcher runs away with his single scene wielding a baseball bat but lets not pretend all these performers are precocious screen presences just off camera you can imagine indeed sometimes almost see grinning kids falling about incredulous that this entire things working at all composer paul williams a songwriter whod written hits for the carpenters and had his material covered by elvis won an oscar nomination for his score and its the songs that breathe life into bugsy malone the infectious stomp of bad guys so you wanna be a boxer fat sams grandslam speakeasy and down and out almost swamp williams wry way with a lyric ella fitzgerald once covered ordinary fool though to be fair so did mel torme why none of this material has received the treatment jay z gave the considerably less memorable its a hard knock life from annie remains a mystery parents should beware the infectious energy might have been designed to recruit otherwise well balanced kids to stage school but lets see a harry potter movie sneak in the line addressed by fat sam to some errant poultry get out of here you dumb clucks verdict the best children dressed as gangsters while killing each other with custard film ever made
4343110 we are reviewing assorted sources of quality information on your facility to see what it says and if it is consistent you should be doing the same
4343111 doctors and hospitals havent figured it out yet but they are simply becoming data entry centers for big brother as the facts and figures are accumulated to be used against them any way the payers decide to move forward
4343112 enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it
4343113 for those who believe that salvation through jesus christ will insure your spiritual eternity in heaven well i agree and yet i disagree
4343114 wow the house is so quiet and peaceful with only nine children
4343115 college campus is where the action is thats where the bet research takes place and truthfully thats where it ought to be taking place you got kids that come to these universities that have a very open mind and think that anything is possible
4343116 having a cultural event alongside the sport brings a totally different set of eyeballs to beijing and the olympics and its great to have this harmony of sport and music
4343117 chinese people love opera dating back to the tradition of chinese opera and they are very open and interested in the whole western opera scene
4343118 the plaintiffs have an opportunity to have these matters heard on that date
4343119 the voice of the people should not be suffocated by the erroneous readings of the law by its own government
4343120 the city clerk was completely out of line in denying us permission to get on the ballot as has been proven today
4343121 he tried to suffocate the voice of the people as the judge said and prevent them from voting on one of the most important issues that the city and county is facing
4343122 the mayor from the start has said how much he respects this process and is certainly not afraid of any sort of question going to the voters
4343123 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4343124 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4343125 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4343126 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4343127 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4343128 most of the effects of low oxygen on fish stocks are what we call sub lethal
4343129 it doesnt kill the fish but stresses them it affects their growth it reduces their reproductive output and makes them more susceptible to disease
4343130 i was hurt yesterday when you ignored my question and told me to shut up
4343131 do things that will show that you have turned from your sins
4343132 ive had my rav4 ev toyotas all electric 4x4 for the last four years
4343133 it was supposed to be a prototype for the next generation of cars but the problem is that the car needs charging every night and the most you can do in a day is 80 miles it is like being tethered
4343134 personal faith is your worldview and that determines how you will lead
4343135 the question at this point is the level of enthusiasm
4343136 is an opportunity for barack obama to talk about his values
4343137 were like a country school in the middle of the city
4343138 we also perform the school play for them and sing christmas carols
4343139 ik ben zo blij het gaat eindelijk goed met me
4343140 weet je nog dat ik je vertelde dat ik hollywood zou gaan veroveren
4343141 het begin is er volgend jaar ga ik een suite huren en neem ik mijn mooiste jurken mee ik zou dolgraag angelina jolie willen aankleden wat een mooie vrouw is dat toch
4343142 ik wil vrouwen alleen maar mooier maken en dat kan alleen met beeldschone jurken
4343143 zij hebben het tragische nieuws overgebracht aan zijn moeder die daar nog steeds woont
4343144 the focus of any recovery program must be to transform the hearts of those receiving care so that their hearts will no longer drive self destructive behavior
4343145 such programs must seek the total commitment of the participants to respond to gods call to be transformed and to be willing to change any aspect of their life that is necessary to support a life free of addiction and they must press the point that one will not arrive at the end of the program but that a life of transformation is gods call to all christians with many rewards along the way
4343146 this is absolutely a changing of the guard and it suggests that the new guard of the evangelical movement is able to generate the attention and focus of both parties
4343147 faith in the halls of power how evangelicals joined the american elite
4343148 helping the church regain credibility and encouraging our society to return to civility
4343149 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4343150 this can be important as a model for a religious leader who is bipartisan in reaching out to find out about candidates
4343151 hes putting himself on center stage at a critical moment with a tremendous amount of responsibility riding on his shoulders
4343152 hes representative of evangelicals who now see that the gospel message is more than just about getting people into heaven its about how we use our spiritual resources to make this world a better place
4343153 he told me to use my influence for those who have no influence
4343154 hes a visionary who sees the potential for the church to be a service organization and a transformative agent in the world
4343155 he thinks big he dreams big and hes pulled off some remarkable things
4343156 im not left wing and im not right wing im for the whole bird you have to have two wings to fly
4343157 i think the polling done at this point is not fine grained enough to see the effect of obamas outreach
4343158 megachurches really have no biblical basis for existance the new testament church took place in homes and synagoges
4343159 pr sident medwedew will keinen keil in die eu treiben aber er wird der kanzlerin klar machen dass die osteurop ischen eu l nder nicht allein die russland politik der eu bestimmen d rfen das w rde eine echte partnerschaft verhindern
4343160 lord no matter what happens here im so thankful that you allowed me to come here this is everything that ive ever dreamed of
4343161 i thank you so much for this no matter what the outcome is i thank you i praise you i give you all the glory whatever happens from this point on just enable me to glorify you no matter what
4343162 so many jamaicans speak patois rather than standard english that this has a chance of communicating with their hearts in a much greater way than standard english does
4343163 we know that there are some problems in terms of the spelling and so forth but what we do know is that it will attract a lot more readers
4343164 im confident that scriptures in jamaican will help strengthen and standardize the language shed inherited colonial prejudice against the language and provide material for literacy and education
4343165 most of all however we want jamaicans to be able to identify somewhat with the linguistically diverse crowd of acts 2 11 bible translation agencies will tell you that the challenges encountered are insignificant in comparison with being able to hear gods word in ones heart language
4343166 the translation projects currently under way or yet to be done are also considered minority languages
4343167 they are communities within a larger context in each of those cases there is some tension should a lot of attention be paid to honoring minority languages or should we push these communities to learn wider languages quicker so they can be part of the larger global community wycliffe says yes to both questions
4343168 it might help people to remember that the greek of the new testament was not the greek of literature but the common greek of the street
4343169 in that sense translating the bible into patois as a language of the people makes very good sense
4343170 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4343171 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on
4343172 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4343173 people have taken many risks and made many sacrifices to be here and just because ice says come here they arent going to leave everything behind
4343174 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4343175 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4343176 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4343177 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4343178 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4343179 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4343180 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4343181 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4343182 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4343183 if he voted against fisa you would be here arguing that he doesnt care about our nations safety
4343184 then i consider the alternative mccain obama is my choice by far
4343185 it did collapse in the manner it was designed to collapse it just did not collapse when it was supposed to obviously
4343186 everything was progressing normally and then suddenly without warning a connection of one leg to the body seemed to fail
4343187 this is one of those projects ed welburn gm design vice president said if you have the chance what else would you do
4343188 if you look backwards to how wagons have done in this country this is a really dumb idea
4343189 for fifty bucks id put my face in their soup and blow
4343190 id rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy
4343191 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4343192 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4343193 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4343194 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4343195 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4343196 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4343197 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4343198 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4343199 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4343200 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4343201 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4343202 ryan is a consummate professional and entrepreneur his cool demeanor intellect and great results make him a large asset to any development team or individual project on each venture he has been involved with he is able to deliver solid results on schedule and within budget i would highly recommend ryan to any person considering his services
4343203 pressing issues that are bridging divides in our nation such as poverty hiv aids climate and human rights in strikingly similar language as
4343204 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4343205 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4343206 this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say
4343207 dont worry the world will be a better place when china rules it and even we americans will be better off youll see
4343208 it has a satin slip underneath with the overlay of silk
4343209 the bottom part of the gown flares out just enought to show off the amazing effect the gown
4343210 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4343211 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4343212 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4343213 im really involved in maternal health ive been working in washington to help raise awareness im a mum so maternal health is very important to me
4343214 ive had safe deliveries for both my children because i have had access to skilled medical care yet for too many women in the developing world pregnancy and childbirth is a serious life and death issue

4343219 yes its very sad and he wasnt even surprised apparently he had been so careless that it was relief to get the im positive thing out of the way
4343220 emotional and excitable alternating between states of ecstasy and depression utterly convinced of his guidance by the spirit and given to boasting of his own achievements utterly convinced of his guidance by the spirit paul revealed his whole personality with an astonishing candor and sincerity his letters were the earliest example of that full acceptance of naked humanity not as it ought to be but as it was
4343221 we hear his raised voice without knowing what the other side was shouting
4343222 some of the text that paul gets blamed for he probably didnt write
4343223 let a woman learn in silence with full submission i permit no woman to teach or have authority over a man she is to keep silent
4343224 paul had people who he called fellow apostles and they were women
4343225 theres also the natural order of things that needs to be respected
4343226 there were some people in pauls school and tradition who took that impulse in paul rather strictly
4343227 so the passage that talks about women not to take leadership roles or to teach in the church are probably not by paul
4343228 we do not know how to pray as we ought but that very spirit intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words
4343229 the elderly tend to have assets a home and might be lonely which make them perfect prey for unscrupulous people
4343230 its so important for seniors to join groups to keep active and to make intergenerational friends
4343231 the elderly need a support system to help them cope when they lose friends and loved ones in their own age group
4343232 in japan the country designates certain older people as living treasures and they honor these people
4343233 thats what i want to do at wise to teach respect for the elderly
4343234 people are so appreciative of your efforts to help them and their family members
4343235 people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who lose excess weight soon after their diagnosis are up to twice as likely to maintain control of their disease than those who dont lose weight or who gain weight according to a new study

4343237 a lot of the religious dogma she had never really used in her entire life became part of her argument against my homosexuality
4343238 indians pride themselves on secular traditions of being a vibrant democracy thats how the country was founded in 1947 those are the values my parents brought me up with
4343239 i felt in some way that i was doing justice to her memory that being more muslim would in some way take away the guilt i felt because of the pain she died with
4343240 i learned to respect religion much more i understood profoundly why the majority of humanity holds on to some kind of faith you cant make a film such as this and come away untouched
4343241 i knew that one day i would want to be in this country i came here in september 2000 one year before 9 11 on a student visa
4343242 you need to get home as soon as possible get off the street because if this has anything to do with muslims which it probably does be careful youre new in this country and you dont know the kind of hate thats going to follow
4343243 now youll know what it feels like because you guys are going to be the new blacks
4343244 in a fun way with what i grew up with
4343245 it was my first festival and it was a completely different film and not one im particularly proud of there was an amazing response but there were also people troubled by the anger they sensed in the film they thought i was really angry and i knew i was
4343246 but into the second year of shooting i realized i could not make it about the muslim experience in america because it was not my experience
4343247 its your family its the music you listen to its the prayer call at dawn those are powerful ties and that was the film i wanted to make
4343248 i think i was remarkably brave because i still have an indian passport and to get visas i had to say i was going for tourism or educational reasons pakistan and bangladesh are not friendly neighbors to india so its very hard to get those visas but when you do arrive its ok because youre basically the same kind of people and speak the same languages
4343249 for at least a thousand years and perhaps longer egypt has been at the heart of intellectual islamic thinking especially in arab countries the largest islamic university in the world is in cairo i needed to experience first hand the sense of entitlement or arrogance that the arabs feel over islam so that people like me from india or pakistan or elsewhere arent really as muslim as they are
4343250 i need at some point to come out of this film because this has been my only identity for six years there has been no other me its been my main way to engage in the world i dont think that could be completely healthy just the title of the film has been a big enough burden to carry
4343251 hes a corn fed blue eyed blond from nebraska an atheist who does not believe in god and a little bit of a piano prodigy
4343252 ummm can you take a look at your list and tell me what you didnt do tonight
4343253 okay blondie doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure it out
4343254 uhhhh i forgot to get the weight on so amp so
4343255 well honestly i overlooked it and it just didnt get done
4343256 these results reflect the hard work of students and teachers the individual achievements of the thousands who have done so well should be celebrated we wish all those that have applied for university the best of luck with finding a suitable place
4343257 i frequently wondered what the young men and women their parents grandparents siblings family friends and indeed their teachers though as they prepared a celebratory meal or prepared to go out when they heard the tory spokesperson on tv telling them that their success was solely due to grade inflation
4343258 your honor we wish to sue the doctor for negligence
4343259 well she was until he began snoring another girls name
4343260 true sir but by coincidence his secretarys name is barzzzzaa
4343261 hold on now what was the priest doing with the ambien
4343262 that doesnt appear to be important to the court at this moment sir
4343263 your honor the people who took these pills are idiots
4343264 but its true sir he complained of sleep deprivation stopping his ability to respond
4343265 your honor the woman was given a device to take care of herself while he slept
4343266 it seems she didnt understand that he wasnt supposed to be involved
4343267 thats good to hear i was getting kind of nervous
4343268 that i really dont want to see any evidence on the matter
4343269 your honor i have evidence to prove all that i say is true
4343270 i understand that but i dont see it needing to be brought up in court besides its fairly obvious its just a box full of ping pong balls
4343271 i was hoping so any other statements by plaintiff or defense none ok then this court will decide in 24 hours
4343272 i long for my mothers bread and my mothers coffee and her touch childhood memories grow up in me day after day i must be worthy of my life at the hour of my death worthy of the tears of my mother

4343284 when we are dreaming alone it is only a dream when we are dreaming with others it is the beginning of reality
4343285 there are many ways of breaking a heart stories were full of hearts being broken by love but what really broke a heart was taking away its dream whatever that dream might be
4343286 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others

4343290 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4343291 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4343292 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty

4343307 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4343354 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4343355 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4343356 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended

4343361 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
4343362 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
4343363 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
4343364 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link

4343403 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4343404 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4343425 one with the eternal father one in nature equal in power and authority god in the highest sense eternal and self existence with life original unborrowed underived
4343426 existed from all eternity distinct from but united with the father possessing the same glory and all the divine attributes
4343427 about as uniform in opposing trinitarianism as they were in advocating belief in the second coming
4343428 forms the essential basis for the very heart of what is unique to christianity
4343429 now if he created everything that was ever created and existed before all created things it is evident that he himself is not among created things
4343430 it is not given to men to know when or how the son was begotten but we know that he was the divine word not simply before he came to this earth to die but even before the world was created
4343431 there was a time when christ proceeded forth and came from god from the bosom of the faith john 8 42 2 18 but that time was so far back in the days of eternity that to finite comprehension it is practically without beginning
4343432 christ took upon himself the flesh not of a sinless being but of sinful man that is the flesh which he assumed had all the weaknesses and sinful tendencies to which fallen human nature is subject
4343433 i f christ took upon himself the likeness of man in order that he might redeem man it must have been sinful man that he was made like for it is sinful man that he came to redeem
4343434 we should have no misgivings in regard to the perfect sinlessness of the human nature of christ
4343435 he had no sinful passions or any taint of sin
4343436 he as our example experience d an equivalency in intensity while remaining a sinless human
4343437 even though we must live constantly within the restrictions of a fallen nature we may be free from even a taint of corruption
4343438 there is nothing that god asks of men and women for which he has not already provided a living demonstration in jesus christ
4343439 when god asks men and women to obey him and to live above sinning he is not asking the impossible or merely tantalizing them
4343440 jesus entered the human family taking the same nature as all other descendants of abraham
4343441 the plan of salvation as well as the time for the second advent depends upon the quality of glory that christians reflect
4343442 for some they mean that jesus did not commit sin either in word deed or thought for others they mean that jesus not only committed no sin but was without the inherited tendencies to sin common to fallen humanity
4343443 he christ took upon himself fallen suffering human nature degraded and defiled by sin
4343444 in taking upon himself mans human nature in its fallen condition christ did not in the least participate in its sin
4343445 the results of the working of the great law of heredity
4343446 he could have sinned he could have fallen not for one moment was there in him an evil propensity
4343447 help create a greater bond of unity among adventists throughout the world
4343448 why dont the editors of ministry have more to say on the current discussion regarding the nature of christ and righteousness by faith where do you stand on these issues
4343449 prior to the publication of questions on doctrine and certain articles appearing in ministry
4343450 i hadnt given much thought to the precise nature of christ
4343451 in the light of this statement i personally have had to admit that whatever type of sinful nature christ had if he had such it had no propensity no natural inclination tendency or bent toward evil whatever ellen whites statements regarding the sinful nature of christ mean they must be interpreted in harmony with this strong qualifying statement
4343452 i cannot understand how a sinful nature could have no evil propensities unless the sinful nature resulted from the effects of sin in other areas than propensities to evil
4343453 a diminished mental physical and moral capacity compared to that of adam prior to his fall
4343454 man has not the free choice of will to choose what he should rightly do
4343455 begins his influence by working in us that we may have the will and completes it by working with us when we have the will
4343456 a will that can and does do god ward whatever it pleases
4343457 god has put salvation out of the control of my own will and put it under the control of his
4343458 if god rides it it wills and goes whence god wills
4343459 a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature diffused into all parts of the soul
4343460 the lord entrusted to adam those gifts which he willed to be conferred on human nature
4343461 with the most eager inclination disposed and hastening to sin
4343462 not a whit remains to man to glory in for the whole of salvation comes from god
4343463 when we who are by nature inclined to evil with our whole heart begin to will good we do so out of mere grace
4343464 everything good in the will is the work of grace alone
4343465 directs bends and governs our heart and reigns in it as in his own possession
4343466 no confirmed mortality or immortality but was a candidate for either
4343467 he could bequeath to his posterity no higher nature than he possessed
4343468 a mortal condition a dying state whose only end was death
4343469 hence the unborn millions of the race were involved with him in the effects of that penalty and all became subject to death
4343470 not from our own sins but from the original transgression of adam
4343471 answerable for his course of life and the use he makes of the privileges within his reach
4343472 those who are found righteous either because they have never violated the law or because they have secured through christ forgiveness for all their transgressions
4343473 but it exists in the motives purposes and desires of the heart
4343474 is that all pervading moral darkness and evil with which our world is enshrouded as with the pall of night
4343475 communicating itself to all who come in contact with it
4343476 the governing power in the nature of man the power of decision or choice
4343477 god made our first parents free moral agents with full liberty to yield or to withhold obedience without freedom of choice adams obedience would not have been voluntary but forced there could have been no development of character
4343478 it is impossible for us of ourselves to escape from the pit of sin in which we are sunken education culture the exercise of the will human effort all have their proper sphere but here they are powerless
4343479 this will that forms so important a factor in the character of man was at the fall given into the control of satan and he has ever since been working in man to will and to do his own pleasure
4343480 you cannot control you impulses your emotions as you may desire but you can control your will and you can make an entire change in your life
4343481 in the change that takes place when the soul surrenders to christ there is the highest sense of freedom
4343482 if we consent he will so identify himself with our thoughts and aims so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to his will that when obeying him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses the will refined and sanctified will find its highest delight in doing his service
4343483 the arian or anti trinitarian views presented in seventh day adventist literature and the ellen g white answer
4343484 the doctrine of the trinity in the seventh day adventist denomination its rejection and acceptance
4343485 the mystery of the trinity god as father son and holy spirit
4343486 the essential nature of their divine unity is one of dynamic creative outflowing and self sacrificing love
4343487 there is one god father son and holy spirit a unity of three co eternal persons
4343488 praise the father praise the son and praise the spirit three in one
4343489 holy father holy son holy spirit three we name you
4343490 there is simply no marked cause effect relationship between her christological expressions after 1888 and the remarkable developments that took place in her teachings on salvation
4343491 the preparation of the lessons is directed by a worldwide sabbath school lesson committee the members of which serve as consulting editors
4343492 main cause for the appearance of the pre fall school of thought
4343493 alas must it ever be so do we stand in our own light wherever we go and fight our own shadows forever

4343508 we are fighting the fire internally and externally there are two turntable ladders spraying water down on the building and ten appliances
4343509 our main aim is to stop the fire spreading to the cornmill shopping centre
4343510 the alarm went off at 12 30am at first we thought it was a false alarm as we had a drill last night then we realised it was for real
4343511 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4343512 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4343513 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4343514 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly
4343515 the crews are now winding down and we believe that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the hotel is still usable
4343516 we have been successful in preventing the fire spreading to commercial premises and we are now winding down operations
4343517 there was an issue with water and we had to pump extra supplies from the river skerne
4343518 we are now liasing with the utilities the police and the council with a view to containing the area but to get as much of the town centre open as possible
4343519 we can now start moving into the building to salvage as much as possible and assess hazards the investigation into the cause will also begin its too early to say what has happened but it looks like it started on the fourth floor

4343540 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4343541 the governor also indicates that she does not believe the charges or circumstances here merit the use of the pardon power
4343542 i guess there are other people that want to be president of the united states or senators or whatever me i want to be a cockfighter i would rather do it out in the wide open where everyone knows it and sees it because i am not ashamed of cockfighting
4343543 dogs are your friend not to say i dont like my chickens but they are not my friend
4343544 it has been a monumental struggle involving lots of people and very many protests economics twists and turns
4343545 they got us down like we outlaws and well if we are washington jefferson jackson all of our presidents they had them so they must not have been low life trash or they wouldnt have been presidents of the united states
4343546 changing your heritage well i dont see where they should think about nothing like that now if its something immoral or improper i can understand it
4343547 i saw a ball of flame and people flying in the air
4343548 a minute later people told me that i was bleeding from my back the police transferred me to iskandariyah hospital
4343549 the army will replace the police in iskandariyah after this security violation
4343550 the police are not capable to deal with the suicide attacks they dont have detectors and the necessary equipment for these kind of attacks
4343551 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4343552 when you come across something like this it sends a tingle up your spine
4343553 i have never seen such an exceptional site as gobero it is actually eight sites where people not only buried their dead but actually lived as well
4343554 the pursuit of these four suspects has had a huge impact in the horn of africa
4343555 they always say we almost found him but then they dont find him after a decade they are still after these suspects still bombing the wrong places killing cows and camels and herders and arresting the wrong people the whole community is paying the price
4343556 they want to create the impression that fazul has a huge network in kenya so they can merit more resources
4343557 i was thinking oh my goodness i can see it now the chinese accused of harsh and brutal tactics against human rights protesters show that they serve kfc and tea to their prisoners they wanted to document our treatment
4343558 just as in other countries assemblies processions and demonstrations must be held according to relevant legal regulations and procedures and shall not be carried out without approval from relevant authorities
4343559 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia where the prime minister is acting more and more like a czar
4343560 degrade and burn up on reentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
4343561 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
4343562 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
4343563 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
4343564 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
4343565 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes
4343566 if the u s says no then they can always find a reason why a soyuz wouldnt be ready to fly when its needed
4343567 congress could very well say the hell with the russians we wont approve the waiver even if it badly hurts our program and interests
4343568 with all i have to do these days how could i pay attention to the olympic games
4343569 if i may be so bold there was another president
4343570 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4343571 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4343572 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4343573 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4343574 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4343575 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4343576 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4343577 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4343578 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years

4343583 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
4343584 brendas last published study using this data set was released in 2000 after she moved to her present facility in 1995
4343585 immediately after that publication one of my colleagues requested a break down of details which had only been superficially summarized in one her tables one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
4343586 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
4343587 this is very troubling on two counts first it the apas own ethics rule 8 14 requires research psychologists to share their data for verification of findings secondly she is the chair of the apa abortion task force which is at least in theory supposed to bring full and clear light to this issue but how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
4343588 there is no doubt that she has selectively reported her findings
4343589 we have seen in the unpublished tables details about specific negative reactions which were obscured in her published report by combining them with three to eight other reactions to create watered down composite scores
4343590 in my view it is irresponsible not to report the significant findings associated with individual symptoms for example she found that a number of women reported that they tried to cope with negative feelings about their abortions by drinking more or taking drugs but she has never not fully shared the details on these reactions in any of her published studies and by refusing to share her data for reanalysis by others she has prevented anyone else from reporting these findings either
4343591 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4343592 even the modifier that there is no credible evidence of mental health risks in the ideal case of a low risk abortion patient is an admission that there is indeed some evidence that a single abortion can pose a risk to the mental health of a emotionally stable adult woman
4343593 in fact the report itself identifies a whole host of studies providing such evidence but it mutes a clear presentation of the findings of these studies by focusing on the limitations of each studys methodology which all studies have in order to justify ignoring their clear implications
4343594 by failing to call on therapists to be alert and sensitive to the negative emotional experiences women attribute to their abortions the task force has allowed ideology to trump sensitivity
4343595 instead they are ignoring the reality of how and why abortions take place and are instead focused on drawing conclusions regarding the safety of abortion for an emotionally stable pro choice adult woman who is freely choosing a wanted abortion without any moral qualms but that doesnt reflect the reality of most abortion situations
4343596 the fact is that coerced abortions are more common than wanted abortions studies show that over 60 of american women are having abortions often against their moral beliefs because they feel pressured into it by third parties these women need therapist and family members to be open to and responsive to their pain not dismissive of it as an anomaly sadly this is an ideological report that simply ignores the concerns and needs of those women for whom abortion has been a heartache rather than a triumph
4343597 i put on my sweatpants sports bra and t shirt to go for a walk i checked that my apartment key was in my pocket and pulled the door closed behind me i turned and ran smack into a pack of thin girls leaving the apartment two doors down given the choice between running into a pack of thin girls and a pack of wolves i hesitated a bit longer than any rational human being should how big were the wolves had they eaten recently how about the thin girls
4343598 i repeated an old saying you wouldnt care about what other people think of you if you knew how infrequently they do in other words everyone else is a self centered bastard too it was easy for me to assume anyone in visual range of my arms was thinking if she flaps her elbows hard enough she could fly away it was more likely they pedaled by thinking my panties are really bunching up in these shorts even if they did spare a moment to think disparaging thoughts about me it was just a passing blip between gear changes
4343599 we originally projected a need for replacement of 4 500 square feet of tile in the eastbound tube
4343600 we later increased the count to 7 800 square feet and now we are adding more than another 4 500 square feet for damaged tile
4343601 we and by that i mean the secretary department of transportation secretary paul mattox and governor joe manchin have made it abundantly clear that this project is to be completed and the tunnel opened by nov 1
4343602 the state the surety company and the contractor are on the same page about that
4343603 we had design representatives here from a foundry that forms and pours steel grating and we have a plan in place to increase the capacity and size of that drain
4343604 i remember during a visit here not too long ago when four moms grabbed my arm and said let me show you the high school and made me tour it
4343605 i was really sad thats where the students of monroe county go to school
4343606 thats why i was thrilled to secure support for an amendment to house bill 562 this terms capital bill that allows certain school districts to use an alternative formula to determine the percentage of their local share for school construction projects
4343607 only school districts that experience extreme property value reductions in the previous two years would be eligible to use this alternative formula
4343608 the total taxable property value in monroe county has decreased significantly lately due to the decreasing taxable value of ormet
4343609 however the five year window means the local share is not immediately reduced that changes with the amendment in house bill 562 it directs the ohio department of education to prepare an alternative equity list ranking ohios 612 school districts based on fiscal year 2008s taxable valuation per pupil
4343610 the district must still pass a bond levy to secure state funds for new buildings but that levy will be much smaller than it would without this legislation
4343611 i believe the conditions of the buildings in the district are so deplorable that we cant afford to wait for other options with the support of the school board and the community i believe that new schools will be built in monroe county in the very near future
4343612 im very excited because usually when they go back to school on the 25th i got to go back to work
4343613 the tdap is actually a combination of tetanus pertussis and diphtheria
4343614 its very important because we dont want students to lose educational time and they wont be able to attend without it so we want them in school
4343615 its a very powerful system and one needs to think that this is the first year were working with it and well just grow the system and use it for years to come
4343616 de wereld gaat niet ten onder door een gebrek aan wonderen maar door een gebrek aan verwondering
4343617 de dwaze mens zoekt geluk in de verte de wijze laat het groeien onder zijn voeten
4343618 weve all had great players at times but they take a long time
4343619 hey were going to run this route that weve never run before well it takes a whole week to get them used to the steps and different coverages and stuff
4343620 then there are people that you tell it to them one time and then all of a sudden they look like theyve been doing it forever he seems to be one of those guys so far
4343621 any time you get an athlete like that a playmaker guy you want to see what he can do
4343622 youre excited to have him and you want to get him in position to get his hands on the ball i think he can handle it
4343623 we had him doing too much and he wasnt as good a runner as he could be
4343624 he had some good things where he was catching the ball and everything else but we were doing all this stuff and we werent really getting his best
4343625 did so many things with him that first year he caught 80 balls and he was lining up all over the place all of a sudden hes getting like 3 2 yards a carry
4343626 the one thing you dont want to do is do so many things that he does nothing well
4343627 hes got to be really good at things before you do too much
4343628 its really up to him more than its up to us how far can he take it how many things can he master and do really well
4343629 you have your up days and you have your down days
4343630 its a joy to me because i played quarterback all the way up to my sophomore year of high school
4343631 some people ask the secret of our long marriage we take time to go to a restaurant two times a week a little candlelight dinner soft music and dancing she goes tuesdays i go fridays
4343632 i dont worry about terrorism i was married for two years
4343633 theres a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic banking its called marriage
4343634 ive had bad luck with both my wives the first one left me and the second one didnt
4343635 borrar del mapa a otras naciones imitando el ejemplo de su
4343636 driven by rising prices of milk bread and other groceries the inflation rate in the new york metropolitan area rose in the last year at its second fastest pace in more than 17 years according to the federal department of labor
4343637 why are you two always so bad in trader joes cant you try to be good when we are here
4343638 thats what were saying to the american people if you dont take it over if you dont win your government back if you dont vote for people you believe in who have a record of accomplishment and a good platform which you can see on votenader org whats left for you to decide i mean these two parties dont represent you in area after area their drum is beaten by the big corporations
4343639 and they really dont have a plan to get out of iraq and they want to expand the afghanistan war
4343640 good thing theres an election coming up once bush is gone the world will get better wont it at least one of the candidates has to be against all this war and threats of war right maybe obama is just playing the game when he promises fealty to tel aviv maybe he doesnt mean it when he sounds like bush in regards to iran maybe hell listen to the american people and not the generals after he gets elected and bring the troops back from iraq by the end of 2009
4343641 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
4343642 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
4343643 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
4343644 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
4343645 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4343646 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
4343647 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4343648 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4343649 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4343650 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4343651 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4343652 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4343653 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
4343654 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4343655 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life
4343656 we acknowledged that there were some positive things about indias track record though we didnt agree with either their testing or their possession of nuclear weapons
4343657 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
4343658 lleg el momento de pasar de los dichos a los hechos en torno a la seguridad p blica y de que los tres rdenes de gobierno federal estatal y municipal establezcan las medidas correctivas necesarias en ese campo
4343659 outcry the magazine just came out ten minutes ago at least give me a few days to decide whether to regret it or not
4343660 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
4343661 anyone whos tried to paint obama as a muslim anyone whos tried to portray michelle as angry or a secret revolutionary out to get whitey anyone who has questioned their patriotism well heres your image
4343662 combines a number of fantastical images about the obamas and shows them for the obvious distortions they are the burning flag the nationalist radical and islamic outfits the fist bump the portrait on the wall all of them echo one attack or another satire is part of what we do and it is meant to bring things out into the open to hold up a mirror to prejudice the hateful and the absurd and thats the spirit of this cover
4343663 as a piece of satire it utterly fails it offered no context other than the the new yorker title above it it merely portrayed a haphazard menagerie of the paranoid myths and stereotypes about the obamas that are being circulated on the internet without knocking them down thats pretty weak satire
4343664 a satirical cartoon would not be any good if it came with a set of instructions
4343665 had they shown an enemy of obama painting the picture or imagining it in their head
4343666 picture a middle aged married couple watching the obamas on tv and the husband imagining them as the terrorists so depicted while the wife seeing them as the reincarnation of jfk and jackie o that would i think nicely illustrate the point of the cover the extreme visions many in this nation have around the probable future first couple anything would have been better than what they did
4343667 that was more of a political controversy more than anything else
4343668 for the cp3 foundation to host someone who plays a leading role in the entertainment industry like ludacris will be a great benefit for the continuous growth of our charity weekend
4343669 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
4343670 in the cahiers astrologiques magazine of 1960 m helmer presented his theory on the cyclic repetition of events a cycle based mainly on using the ideal pre eminent number 25920 and its factors applying his theory enabled him to make many exact predictions both economic and political
4343671 in his account he gave a special place to the ideal number 25920 years here is an excerpt of his thesis he begins by saying each of the three astrological phenomena that we know are signs in the sky of coordinates of three space times a the earths rotation on its axis equals the space time of the houses in worldly astrology themes of nations regimes political leaders these themes being like the second hand of the cosmic clock b the earths revolution around the sun equals the space time of the heavy planetary cycles it is like the minute hand of the cosmic clock c finally the precession of the equinoxes which has 25920 as its symbolic number the numerological rhythms of this number give us the hour hand of the cosmic clock
4343672 translated to english how am i supposed to know that a guy likes me he and i have been friends since primary school and we became closer these few months he seems to care so much about me and always offer to send me back to shah alam once he took a vacation oversea and he smsed me almost everyday updating his whereabout he just recently broke up with his girlfriend and he said that he has given up on her so how do i know whether he really likes me or im just a rebound
4343673 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4343674 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4343675 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4343676 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4343677 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4343678 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4343679 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4343720 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4343721 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4343722 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4343723 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4343731 i actually first heard about damanhur through fortean times magazine many years ago long before the story seemed to break on the mainstream media in the us this year ive had their original pre tourist board push web site bookmarked for a long time http www tempio it i put little stock in their mash up of new age beliefs and their pursuit of pseudo scientific psychotronic technologies but though it tends to look in style like a secret lair for the abominable dr phibes i do think their temple is one of the great works of contemporary art and architecture and an excellent example of the potential of excavated architecture which i have used as an example in discussions of practical strategies of lunar and planetary settlement and its another good example of how people are cultivating images of the future derived from the ancient past whats most intriguing about damanhur though is the subversive nature of its culture in ancient times it was common for cults alchemists herbalists and early scientists to rely on encryption as a means of securing their research and knowledge from competitors or from exposure to authorities but with damanhur we have this situation and still pre internet at the start mind you of a community of about 1000 people who effectively cultivated an encrypted culture flying under the radar of european authorities for decades they even had their own secret currency and yet somehow managed to avoid the waco treatment long enough to secretly construct one of the largest and most sophisticated works of architecture ever created by such a tiny religious community in modern times its like the plot of a science fiction story where the descendants of ancient astronauts are drawn together into a secret tribe with a secret racial language and pool together bits and pieces of the plans for a starship extracted out of their own dna and then construct it in a secret underground hangar its an amazing demonstration of the potential of small groups of people systematically cultivating surplus productivity through community structures and then applying that to a shared goal this is the sort of amplifying effect i have anticipated for things like cultivating post industrial technology within a community setting though of course with damanhur theres the factor of religious fervor as well we squander a lot of our lives to other peoples profit in exchange for cash though i wouldnt consider it a model to follow this is definitely a good picture of just how much that lost productivity amounts to if 1000 determined people could build this in their spare time what could a million do another religious community that has impressed with their sophistication is auroville in southern india http www auroville com this site used to be more about the community but had since gone more commercial the community info apparently moved to auroville org but the site down at the moment however the auroville earth institute page has a good overview of the community architecture i learned of them through my study of earth block architecture for use in non toxic mcs adaptive housing they have produced some of the most sophisticated earthen architecture in the world and developed what i think is the most advanced form of cinva ram ever created the auram 3000 they may even hold the world record for the largest span earth block vaults and domes ever built and the largest solar oven kitchen unlike other religious communities they are very public and involved in a broad spectrum of industries another interesting community thats not exactly a religious community but was founded if memory serves by a catholic priest after the spanish civil war is mondragon in arrasata spain http en wikipedia org wiki mondrag n cooperative corporation youve probably already heard of this one it is based on a workers cooperative that was founded as a trades apprenticeship school for disadvantaged youth whose graduates turned entrepreneurs and formed a coop that just kept getting progressively more industrially sophisticated until if became a multinational multi industry coop and could compete with other european technology centers ive considered it a possible model for the greenstar industrial cooperative that ive proposed in tmp2 this is a good example of a pre internet p2p economic system cultivated in a community setting exploiting community nepotism in a progressive way it seems to incorporate many of the characteristics of the systems proposed by economist louis kelso though with more of a traditional early 20th century socialist bent to it

4343735 di lain waktu saat aku siap untuk melakukan konser aku memanggil ketua bandku dan dia bilang kita tidak bisa main karena kita akan pergi ke tempat tempat pribadi seperti ke teluk persia untuk menjadi penggembira pasukan tentara
4343736 aku bilang bagaimana kau bisa mendapatkan jadwal itu aku ingin sekali main di sana dan dia bilang lagi dennis kenal dengan jenderalnya dan dia yang mengaturnya

4343743 alasan kami ada dua pertama kami rasa musim panas adalah waktu yang ideal untuk merilis film keluarga yang kedua kami masih merasa cemas akan aksi mogok para penulis jadi kami memutuskan untuk memindah jadwal perilisan ke tahun 2009

4343745 kami sudah tidak sabar membagi film ini dengan para penggemar
4343746 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years

4343751 there may have been multiple positions which were reclassified but they all appear to have been held by just one trader and this was a very special trader with an enormous concentration of positions in crude oil amounting to perhaps 460 million barrels and not much interest in anything else

4343753 vamos por la vieja calle carabobo en un paseo que empieza desde el museo de antioquia y va hasta moravia antes moravia era todo un estereotipo nacido de la ignorancia y la estigmatizaci n de su gente era el desconocimiento de una cultura pero desde que se hicieron estas obras moravia es un territorio por descubrir
4343754 como ves el jard n bot nico ya no tiene muros sino estas rejas que permiten que la ciudad disfrute de la naturaleza tienes que entrar especialmente a ver el vivero cuya arquitectura es geom trica
4343755 se trata de promover las competencias ciudadanas basadas en ejes de pertenencia la construcci n de comunidades y la responsabilidad social a trav s de proyectos pedag gicos en las instituciones educativas p blicas de la ciudad de medell n
4343756 estas fotos muestran varios aspectos de la calle carabobo desde finales del siglo xix y podemos ver c mo ha cambiado en esta foto podemos ver a moravia un espacio destinado a las basuras desde entonces pero se ve que desde aquella poca ya hab a gente que viv a en el lugar y en estas fotos puedes ver c mo dur la construcci n de la universidad de antioquia esta casita aqu era la ltima estaci n del tranv a y puedes ver que se llamaba moravia as que el nombre no fue en su origen nada malo sino por el contrario un punto de referencia esta casa estaci n existe a n y es hoy una tienda que puedes ver en la subida a aranjuez
4343757 s veo muchos cambios y me siento muy contento pero a n encuentro una cierta agresividad en mucha gente sobre todo aquellos que est n detr s del volante
4343758 queremos que la ciudad no sea solo para el turista sino que lo sea tambi n para el habitante de la ciudad por eso llevamos a los muchachos a conocer museos y parques para que entren en contacto con ellos para que un museo no sea una cosa aburrida una vez una muchacha le peg un chicle a una obra de botero y hubo que traer expertos que removieran el chicle de la obra sin da arla pero ello signific que se programara en el colegio toda una jornada para que los muchachos entendieran el valor universal de una obra como esa
4343759 no vas a reconocer la 68 es la nueva zona rosa de castilla un lugar que cambi mucho y se volvi un espacio de paz justo paralela al parque juanes

4343761 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4343762 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4343763 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4343764 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4343765 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4343766 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4343767 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4343768 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4343769 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4343770 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4343771 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4343772 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
4343773 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
4343774 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight
4343775 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4343776 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4343777 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4343778 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4343779 we got him in to the hut and got him comfortable but i think it happened pretty fast
4343780 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4343781 deep concern over the deteriorating situation in indian occupied kashmir
4343782 oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi
4343783 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4343784 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4343785 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4343786 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4343787 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4343788 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4343789 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4343790 to continue with the process of change in democracy and peace
4343791 the bolivian government is going to guarantee autonomy for all of bolivia but within a framework of legality and constitutionality
4343792 i feel the opposing governors only want the silver money and do not wish to deal with other matters without considering what the bolivian people think
4343793 i conclude that the bolivian people want autonomy they want a new political constitution
4343794 now no governor can talk about two thirds more than two thirds of the people want to unite the new constitution with the statutes for autonomy
4343795 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4343796 i played really clean matches in the past and the next one would be kind of streaky i don t want to do that any more
4343797 the caspian region is wondering what this means for the future
4343798 the nabucco pipeline now is dependent not only on gas from the caucuses and from east of the caspian but also from iran
4343799 this goes against the whole concept of nabucco that it would not be either russian or russian controlled gas
4343800 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works

4343807 the greenhouse and air quality emissions of biodiesel blends in australia
4343808 the results of this study show biodiesel has the potential to reduce emissions from the transport industry which is the third largest producer of greenhouse gases in australia behind stationary energy generation and agriculture
4343809 the greenhouse gas savings do however depend on the feedstock used to produce the biodiesel the highest savings are obtained by replacing base diesel with biodiesel from used cooking oil resulting in an 87 per cent emission reduction
4343810 the results of this study show biodiesel has the potential to reduce emissions from the transport industry which is the third largest producer of greenhouse gases in australia behind stationary energy generation and agriculture
4343811 palm oil can produce up to an 80 per cent saving in emissions provided it is sourced from pre 1990 plantations the palm oil source is critical as product from plantations established on recently dried peat swamps or cleared tropical forest will in fact have higher greenhouse gas emissions than regular diesel due to factors such as land clearing
4343812 if the last six decades since the nations founding have been spent achieving fundamental freedoms the next 60 years should be dedicated to realizing freedom with responsibility
4343813 i will show with action that there would be no tolerance for violation of the law regardless of who you are including myself
4343814 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
4343815 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
4343816 i wait wait and about 11 oclock about six of them they come around
4343817 to look at their faces they dont look good and they say sorry youve been cancelled
4343818 instead hes been given a telephone number to call to check whether there will be a bed available

4343822 thou art simply deaf one who is deaf cannot hear music nor can he hear the radio so he might say never having heard them that such things do not exist
4343823 the system itself is wonderful especially getting to watch a guy like tom and the other quarterbacks execute it every day
4343824 and tom being in his eighth year in the offense maybe ninth its pretty much artwork when its at its best
4343825 as a young quarterback thats all you can ask for a chance not only to see it on film to see it presented by josh mcdaniels and some of the other coaches but at the same time to come out here on the field and see the way its supposed to be done every time
4343826 his ability to move on from the previous play and play at such a high level no matter what happens
4343827 playing quarterback theres a lot of things that happen on a play to play basis that you might not have anything to do with but it can affect you if you let it affect you then your negative play can turn into 10 negative plays if youre not really mentally strong thats the one thing that makes him so special just being around him you can see how mentally tough he is watching him on tape he makes it all go just by being able to move on to the next play
4343828 why are we all here and from where did we come why are some so happy while some are so glum
4343829 the cat in the hat did not make you aloof
4343830 hes thrilled to be with this team at this time in his career
4343831 it came down to a very simple desire of winning another championship
4343832 i know hes a great safety and hes had a lot great years in this league
4343833 hes a hard tenacious hitter hes a tempo setter and he brings the wood every week
4343834 for a rookie hes learning the system like a lot of guys he has good days he has bad days i think overall weve been fairly happy with what hes done hes progressed a lot from minicamp back in the spring right after we drafted him he came back and knew a lot about what we want him to do
4343835 by being so tied to the wedding dream i ended up in a financial nightmare
4343836 you really dont need to invite everyone you know or have a party of 20 bridesmaids
4343837 theres no way to go about making it affordable and really fabulous unless youre a rock star or someone you know is kuwaiti
4343838 its not only an instant budget saver but a way to make the whole event more intimate
4343839 people walk away remembering the unique experience you create and not the food that you served
4343840 they spend tons of money on decor and they have a great band but if they dont spend on lighting you cant see what theyve done
4343841 paper is cheap and most people have a computer word processing software and a decent printer already at home which makes invitations an easy way to save some cash and be creative
4343842 we really love our wedding photos and still get compliments on them to this day she was worth the extra cash we spent
4343843 nobody needs another placecard frame or a bottle of crummy wine with your name on it
4343844 youd be much better off to have all your bridesmaids or ushers bake cookies and enclose a great recipe
4343845 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4343846 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality
4343847 since we started with this local part of the magazine we tried to avoid these kinds of articles so the first thing i want to do here is to apologize with all the people who will not share my views for some days i kept everything for myself and i did not write any single line about the russian georgian crisis but now everything is going too far for staying silent
4343848 the volume of the estonian economy was 1 4 smaller year on year in the second quarter of 2008 compared with spring the global economic growth outlook has worsened with growth indicators being volatile in this context it is logical that there occurred no pivotal changes in economic growth in the second quarter in estonia only a sharp improvement in export opportunities would have been able to make up for the expected weakening of domestic demand against the backdrop of last years rapid growth
4343849 get dried wood we need a bigger fire viola do you need to stay in alfys saddle to keep him breathing fire
4343850 im not doing a thing in the saddle he already seems to know what to do
4343851 no he doesnt but let him go we need wood
4343852 well never get through in time at the rate the hydras creeping weve got to build a bon fire under the hydra big enough to keep it busy while we slip past
4343853 only the right side on the left theres still parts not yet aflame
4343854 weve still got a little light not much but it may be enough anyway im going last ill protect our rear
4343855 were not leaving alfy behind hes going first viola hold your nose and ride your pet into the little space between the cliff and the hydra tell him to burn the creature
4343856 the hydra creature will feel the dragon fire and try to flee it

4343859 youse think this is funny louie the fork growled and speared the tortellini and gnocchi
4343860 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancer than all the other gene mutations discovered so far the reasonable expectation is that this will save some lives
4343861 if confirmed in larger studies this finding brings us another step closer towards unravelling the inherited risk of bowel cancer
4343862 it gives those agencies carte blanche to do what they want
4343863 its not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
4343864 its ridiculous to admit that something is endangered because of climate change and then say the law doesnt apply to climate change
4343865 the bush administration is trying to do by regulation what they cant do by legislation
4343866 jesus i know you are real and i do believe in you but loving others is so hard can i just not care for awhile it would be so much easier
4343867 there will always be many like john who are led to the mother through the son but also many others like joseph who are led to the son through the mother these two movements which in the beginning are very clearly emphasized in certain individuals will later be the paths on which many can wander

4343903 hey if i did this before anyone else i would look smart
4343904 when things are bad and getting worse keep a cookie in your purse
4343905 im above the below and below the upper stuck in the middle where money gets tight but im doing all right
4343906 when you want to give up and your hearts about to break remember that youre prefect god makes no mistakes
4343907 i just wanted to share some photos of my daughter scarlet snow in your
4343908 we got the dress this evening justina tried it on right away to see how it fit i wanted to share the photos with you she just loves the dress
4343909 i stumbled across your website by chance i had to write in and let you know how happy i was with my order the selection is great and the prices are so affordable i couldnt have been any more pleased with my purchase thank you
4343910 listen you small smelly man james has to go to the bathroom so just raise your white flag like they taught you in school and let me through
4343911 my warpaint is sharpie ink and ill show you how much my shit stinks
4343912 just wanted to let you know that your online pictures and gowns were beautiful
4343913 yes and its this afternoon in approximately three hours thirty two minutes and in a matter of moments forty two seconds
4343914 youre going to be late that much is certain but how late you are to be is up to you
4343915 i have to invite the duchess the mock turtle the hatter the cheshire cat that dreadfully lazy doormouse the gryphon and all of chessland then finally i have to invite myself but i might not have time to do that for i have to show back up at the queens castle in an hour ten minutes and fifteen seconds so ill have to forego my invitation and decline showing up at the party
4343916 sadly yes this may be the last time you see me boys and neither of you are dressed for the occasion
4343917 thank you boys but that doesnt lighten my mood im already going to be late as it is in talking to you
4343918 no ive squandered enough time and now someone else might not receive their invitation and ill get beheaded twice
4343919 the last day i get to gaze upon the checkered lands and marvel at the spiral sky
4343920 the schedule you sent me was mon fri 2 3
4343921 im gonna walk up and be like gig is up whyd you come
4343922 there are times like its one of those cities i might catch some flack for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4343923 i know it has been a while since michael last played for scotland
4343924 the whole team did well against motherwell and michael did everything i asked of him
4343925 it is not for me to tell other managers how to do their job but if michael keeps doing his job for hearts then the international team could well become a possibility for him in the future
4343926 he will have learned a lot since the last time he played for his country and will have matured since then his priority is doing well for heart of midlothian however and if he can do that then hopefully other things may follow
4343927 i know calum elliot is a good player and that inverness are interested but livingston is much closer to edinburgh and we hope that will be a factor for him
4343928 this season i want to be right at the peak of my game
4343929 because i worked hard i played for the team and yes i contributed in other ways and played quite well people praised some of my performances
4343930 but i wasnt at the peak of my game and thats the aim for this season to play at the best of my ability
4343931 thats something that i have to achieve now and i am under the right coaching staff here to help me do that
4343932 you have to be at your very very best every time you pull on the green and white hoops
4343933 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
4343934 considering he missed most of last season we would hope he would be injury free now
4343935 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
4343936 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well
4343937 his jersey got tugged and he threw himself into a challenge he didnt need to make and he could have got hurt as well
4343938 that rules him out for sunday which i am really annoyed about
4343939 i dont mind a player having an aggressive streak in him because i think as a competitive sportsman youve got to have that
4343940 you certainly dont want to get suspended and he has been foolish he is just a young boy but i want to try and stamp it out if i can
4343941 danny had every chance of playing against celtic and did enough against hamilton in the second half to get back into my thoughts
4343942 now he will be sitting on the sidelines and ive got loads of midfielders to chose from
4343943 dannys had a couple of wee niggles and has missed a few days training so hasnt been involved an awful lot
4343944 it is likely we will need a second striker after the injury to pierre
4343945 it was good to finally get 90 minutes under my belt in a celtic shirt and i know im getting to where i want to be fitness wise
4343946 i found it tough going at times but i see it as another landmark in my career at this club
4343947 its been great getting to know all the boys and with every game im becoming more familiar with them and taking another step forward
4343948 it was a massive thrill getting on against manchester city last week but playing my first 90 minutes for months is an even more significant step
4343949 i need competitive first team games under my belt before i even think about internationals and thats what im working on at the moment
4343950 ill know exactly when im ready and so will the manager gordon strachan
4343951 im certain hell be impressed with me when i get myself up to 100 percent fitness and im working flat out to get there
4343952 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
4343953 considering he missed most of last season we would hope he would be injury free now
4343954 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
4343955 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well
4343956 puedo ser tu debilidad o tu esclava todo est en que te arriesgues
4343957 soy tu debilidad soy tu infierno y esperar s mi retorno
4343958 estaba listo ara todos tus mordiscos y preparado para todos tus pecados yo ten a el coraz n adormecido t casi siempre el paladar anestesiado
4343959 as for jamie smith hes still in the same boat as severin and mackie
4343960 as soon as we get all that stuff out the road then well get on with the others
4343961 they love it up here but we just have to wait and see
4343962 but obviously weve got to get the other things sorted out
4343963 inside the polls margin of error thereby indicating a possible dead heat

4343968 je kan moeilijk een sculptuur in een tent gaan zetten op dit moment droogt het zand zelfs te vlug uit en moet er regelmatig met de waterslang wat verneveld worden

4344243 were looking to add a few people to our family over the last couple of months we have had some people pick up and move on with their lives being a volunteer department people come and go as they please time permitting they offer their time down here at the station to help recently we have had a couple people move on and now we are looking to fill those shoes
4344244 the best part of it is you can come in here with no certifications and no training but if you want to work with our department we will send you to school and pay for the schooling for fire and ems the only catch there is that if we pay for it we expect to have two years of service from you and after the two years your commitment is complete
4344245 this is a good place to get your feet wet and begin your career our department will pay for your fire and ems school and we have training at the station ever monday night our department works hard at keeping up with all of the latest technology and training for our personnel if someone is looking to get onto a fulltime department this could be a good stepping stone for them although we obviously would like them to stay with us we understand probably half of our department works for a fulltime department as well

4344256 now with the creative team in place bigger illusions than weve ever had and the addition of superstar carmen electra were ready to bring our spectacular show to the most exciting entertainment city in the world
4344257 ive been approached many times to perform in las vegas and its always been a dream of mine to do that
4344258 but it had to be the right show at the right time with the right people when i had the chance to see hans perform i was blown away and knew that this was the right show
4344259 its an unbeatable combination for our new resort shes stunning and hes absolutely amazing our new planet hollywood is all about the world of entertainment and offering our guests the hottest talent from around the globe
4344260 this exciting collaboration between carmen electra a vegas icon and hans klok one of europes most dynamic talents is a great way to start

4344264 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4344265 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4344266 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4344267 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4344268 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4344269 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4344270 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2
4344271 allegations that rene gambles as much as 1 million per week are totally false

4344277 i dont see this team ever leaving this is a great hockey market
4344278 its been a long time coming its something thats exciting for all of us
4344279 it was a painful process but the end result was worth it
4344280 i cant wait to sit on one of those seats in the new arena
4344281 even though gta sales were down 12 per cent from the best ever july 2007 figure of 8 912 sales were up 10 per cent from july 2006 7 082
4344282 there are variety of industries that feed into the energy industry including manufacturing industries in ontario and other areas of central canada there are wealth effects in portfolios there are wage effects for secondary and tertiary industries spread across the country
4344283 and that puts us in the industrialized countries in very rare company
4344284 the banks are well capitalized they are quite frankly at the leading edge of disclosure
4344285 in a world of de leveraging of the financial system many global financial institutions are trying to get where our financial institutions are and they are quite a ways away
4344286 canadian exporters are clearly hurting right now thanks to a major slowdown in the u s a slowing global economy and a persistently high canadian dollar
4344287 this likely reflects high employment and increases in wealth and real income
4344288 although june 2008 sales in the greater toronto area gta have declined 18 per cent to 8 600 from the june 2007 total of 10 451 june 2007 was the best performance ever for that month
4344289 this year were seeing a return to calmer conditions but the market remains healthy when compared to the 8 730 transactions in june 2006 gta sales activity in june 2008 decreased by only one per cent
4344290 the increase in listings we have seen in recent months has resulted in a slightly longer period during which homes are on the market from 29 days a year ago to 34 days currently
4344291 this has given buyers and sellers a little more time to make well considered decisions
4344292 the average price in the gta during the first half of july was 379 072 which is a one per cent increase from the 374 254 recorded in the first two weeks of july 2007 and a nine per cent increase from 346 267 recorded during the same period in july 2006
4344293 continued strength in house prices throughout the gta indicates that consumers continue to recognize the value of real estate as a long term investment
4344294 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4344295 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4344296 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4344297 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4344298 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4344299 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4344300 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4344301 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4344314 there is a url to a laboratory notebook like this that is freely available and indexed on common search engines it does not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world basically no insider information

4344319 over the last few years we had the mandate to look all over the world to see where magic was today and what we could possibly do and in this search we found criss angel
4344320 we thought we have the opportunity here to do something special
4344321 it was amazing being up there and literally looking down at traffic seeing me and almost crashing to a halt in disbelief
4344322 at first we thought the giant 800 watts of candle power would fry him after all there are thousands of moths insects and birds fried up there but the bigger problem was the ultraviolet thats the danger from the sun to burn your skin the last seven weeks were very intense working it all out so he wouldnt be burned alive and at the same time not blinded and so we could see it with the cameras
4344323 not only did i wear a special protective suit under my clothes but i had to put on special goggles so my eyes wouldnt be harmed but it was the greatest experience of my life im thrilled we were able to make that magic
4344324 im exhausted im operating without full sleep this is dangerous but we must finish the series with the very best illusions in the world today i just have to keep pushing to make everything better and more sensational my fans deserve the best possible magic this is something i have worked for all my life and i will never let them down

4344328 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4344329 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4344330 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4344331 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4344332 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4344333 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4344334 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4344335 who are open to doing something on the production side
4344336 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4344337 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4344338 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4344339 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4344340 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4344341 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4344342 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4344343 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4344344 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4344345 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4344346 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4344347 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4344348 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4344349 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4344350 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4344351 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4344352 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4344353 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4344354 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4344355 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4344356 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4344357 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4344358 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4344359 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4344360 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4344361 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4344362 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4344363 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4344364 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4344365 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4344366 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4344367 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4344368 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4344369 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4344370 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4344371 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4344372 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4344373 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4344374 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4344375 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4344376 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4344377 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4344378 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
4344379 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4344380 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4344381 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4344382 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4344383 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4344384 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4344385 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4344386 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4344387 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4344388 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4344389 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4344390 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4344391 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4344392 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4344393 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4344394 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4344395 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4344396 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4344397 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4344398 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4344399 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4344400 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4344401 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4344402 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4344403 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4344404 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4344405 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4344406 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4344407 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4344408 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4344409 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4344410 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4344411 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4344412 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4344413 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4344414 its a bitter sweet symphony this life youre a slave for money then you die
4344415 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair

4344444 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4344445 a lot of parents arent very aware often they are the last to know many parents dont get their teens to us until their senior year of high school then they lament not bringing them in when they are 15 or 16
4344446 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4344447 its an invitation if a teenager is looking for drugs teenagers are prone to experimentation and having the medication in the home makes it easier because it is free we need to make parents more accountable to their medications when you are done with them throw them out
4344448 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4344449 it is inexcusable that there are so many problem parents who dont try harder who fail to appropriately monitor their children on school nights fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of their reach and tolerate drug infected schools for their children

4344506 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4344507 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4344508 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4344509 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4344510 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4344511 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases

4344515 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4344516 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4344517 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away

4344520 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4344521 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4344522 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4344523 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4344524 residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain

4344534 robert mugabe was sworn on 30th june to a new term as zimbabwes president and called for dialogue between the countrys political parties after a one man election widely denounced as illegitimate
4344535 after taking the oath of office from chief justice godfrey chidyausiku at his state house residence the 84 year old leader issued an appeal for
4344536 tsvangirai won the first round on march 29 with 47 9 per cent of the vote against 43 2 per cent for mugabe just short of an outright majority defying international and regional calls for him to postpone the election mugabe pushed ahead with the vote anyway warning against outside interference in his countrys affairs and shrugging off tsvangirais claims of violence
4344537 his mother told robert mugabe when he was a child that he had been chosen by god to be a great leader no wonder he thinks only divine power not elections not foreign critics not a crumbling economy or a much younger opposition leader can unseat him in the mind of zimbabwes leader of nearly three decades reality is summed up by a massive banner hanging in the entrance to the presidential offices mugabe is right
4344538 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye

4344554 i knew it even before you told us you do look like a programmer
4344555 you must love chocolate then do you love chocolate are you a chocoholic

4344557 so have you had enough of all these questions from us

4344559 hey why not take time and actually pick middle names for our next kids this time lets not worry about get used to it eventually
4344560 you have to quit thinking of this as only sports
4344561 its a showcase for athleticism and talent every four years you get to see these super talented athletes compete you get to watch things you dont normally get to see on television
4344562 but we will get to as much as we can
4344563 in the long run america better remain engaged with china and understand that we can have a cooperative and constructive yet candid relationship
4344564 i see america as a nation that is a world leader that has got great values and leverage
4344565 i think the olympics are gonna serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have you know the opportunity to converse with people from around the world
4344566 this is a very positive development in my view for peace
4344567 you gonna go to a couple more events before you leave
4344568 im going to swimming if youd ever let me off this set
4344569 youd like to fast forward the clock two years but were fortunate to be here in the process
4344570 we were not looking to trade tifu he wanted to be traded
4344571 we are however very pleased with what we got in return
4344572 i have all the respect in the world for yannick and i hate to see him go but if he doesnt want to play here he doesnt want to play here and my job is to take care of the dayton bombers
4344573 im looking for young players with energy and character and i think we got that in these guys
4344574 we were aware of what tifu was capable of and we were aware of his interest
4344575 we also know theres a big risk associated with the trade no question about it because were giving up some quality players and tifu could be called up at any time
4344576 but were not a team to hold anyone back so were willing to take the risk and hope that hes here long enough to contribute to our team
4344577 we have to get cueto out of that first inning with a lower pitch count
4344578 and their lineup rolls around quicker and you face the big boys again in the second or third instead of the fourth
4344579 if he has as 1 2 3 first inning who knows how deep he might go into a game
4344580 im just glad he got the win because he has been pitching great
4344581 this guy is a competitor he competes he wants it
4344582 it is refreshing to see him on the mound and he is controlling his emotions a little better and im excited for him and us and his future
4344583 thats what young people are supposed to do and he brought some speed the way he covers ground and runs the bases
4344584 it was so exciting i just dont know what to say i felt really comfortable and worked out all the jitters
4344585 we have a little verbal confirmation and at the time berry didnt know if i understood what he said
4344586 i got the sign from the git go and i was geared up because i know keppinger is a good bunter as soon as he made the call i knew wed get an automatic run
4344587 i got good pitches to hit and thats all you can ask for
4344588 i was able to put a pretty good swing on things
4344589 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4344590 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4344591 i like what i see when i look to my left and when i look to my right
4344592 the more reps i take at center the more comfortable i become thats good i want quarterback carson palmer to feel comfortable too
4344593 youve got to temper the testosterone a little bit on that one
4344594 you look at it and its huge and all that but playing center is not something you all of a sudden just do to me today was just another day in training camp working on options
4344595 i think thats unstoppable personally with regard to the run and having rudi johnson and chris perry back there
4344596 i feel they can go for 150 yards every game with that line thats a lot of meat in there
4344597 if im going to vegas im not betting on that
4344598 false information thats all i can say that makes me look like a jackass you never hear players talking about money i dont think about the offseason me and my agent dont even talk about numbers
4344599 thats great hes a little down and dirty dude he looks good gives a great target and he is throwing better than i remember in spring training and i like how he blocks the ball
4344600 in fact hell start friday against the cardinals either in left field or shortstop jeff keppinger shortstop looks like he is coming out of it a slump
4344601 when i walked out into the stadium it was amazing
4344602 i almost started crying because of the whole experience and everything
4344603 i felt like i ran pretty well especially in the heat
4344604 i know its not as fast as the trials but its my second fastest ever and it got me some good points for whats to come
4344605 he brought up the ohio state texas football game a couple years ago and i told him if you want to see the best program in ohio come see a ud football game
4344606 this was the greatest experience of my life ive done a lot of major things in politics and life but theres nothing i have fonder memories of than what i did on this field
4344607 the single most important thing i did in preparation for the world i live in it was about working together as a team working hard nobody being above anybody else and one of the lessons you learn in football is one you have to learn in life youre going to get knocked down and you have to get back up
4344608 i still kick myself about plays i didnt make when i was here and still remember them like yesterday
4344609 i remember all the games of our national championship playoffs and everything that happened in them you ask me about anything else that happened in 1989 and i couldnt tell you anything
4344610 you dont have control of when youre born or when you die
4344611 but you have control of the dash what are you going to do you control your destiny you decide what the dash means
4344612 were a little banged up at a couple spots on the o line
4344613 the timing wasnt there and in our offense timing is everything
4344614 we have expectations because were dayton we always have high expectations
4344615 but just because we had success last year we realize its a whole new team and we have to do it for ourselves this year
4344616 and rock n roll gave me a place for that music to live
4344617 im going to check you out and im going to keep you in my heart
4344618 its probably one of the hottest 100 meter dashes in history
4344619 no i dont know that keyleaigh is allergic to peanuts but i keep hearing so much about it im not going to take any chances please send this sundae back to the kitchen

4344624 we want to save our nation from all wrongdoings mischief and oppressive governance
4344625 at this stage the way the weather forecast is looking it maybe early tomorrow saturday before the helicopters can get in there
4344626 it is an extreme environment its an alpine area a place where you need to be on your game
4344627 this is really going to affect our town real bad
4344628 they were just little kids 10 year olds that died
4344629 violence in sport will not be tolerated police have charged three people with affray over the tamplin road incident earlier this month
4344630 this kind of behaviour puts the lives and safety of members of the public and police at risk
4344631 we will continue to work closely with league officials to stamp out this deplorable behaviour which is unacceptable in any situation particular kids sporting events
4344632 the overturning of the ban on appeal is disappointing the banning of the teams sent a clear message that violence in kids sport will not be tolerated i am liaising with officials at the parramatta district junior rugby league competition and calling for assurances that no further incidents will occur at upcoming games
4344633 als kapit n kann man nicht alles allein entscheiden deshalb ist dieser rat wichtig
4344634 ich bin von der entscheidung des trainers schon berrascht aber ich hatte auch nicht damit gerechnet dass marcelinho geht wir haben auch andere spieler in der mannschaft die kapit n sein k nnten

4344657 that fact is one of the charms of this series
4344658 it could have been written 60 years ago and yet its absolutely fresh in what it does with basic scientific ideas that was very deliberate i wanted to say to the reader you dont need nanotech or indeed any new science or technology to write science fiction thats entirely original and mind boggling to boot theres life in old newton yet
4344659 so as a journey home with swordfights pirate sun is a deliberate cross between the odyssey and the three musketeers
4344660 i couldnt just leave them tumbling through the weightless air of virga so in that sense queen of candesce and pirate sun just wrap up the story begun in the first novel
4344661 in a bigger sense though i had so many ideas and settings and characters i still wanted to write about after the first two books that pirate sun would have been necessary even if all the plots had been neatly wound up i barely scratched the surface of this world in the first two books i wanted to show the reader that there were still many many wonders left to see there
4344662 virga is a whole new world a whole new kind of world for science fiction writers and readers to explore
4344663 if they use billy bob he will reinterpret the character and thats what you want you dont want somebody just copying me im very physical billy bobs not a physical actor hes a sound actor and an internal actor i think it will be very different
4344664 the uncanny common denominator in my recent work is that they were all first time directors
4344665 i did 2001 maniacs and i did hatchet with adam green and i did behind the mask for scott glosserman and i ran off and worked for my old pal bob keen up in canada and did heartstopper and then i came back and did jack brooks monster slayer and then zombie strippers theyre all first time directors
4344666 im trying to think whats been missing i think theres a younger generation now thats missing the fun that we used to have
4344667 it was like somebody had sent me the missing lost classic episode of twilight zone
4344668 it was this perfect black and white short filmed i called up my agent and said i gotta work for these guys they really know their stuff
4344669 i knew i was going to be mutating into this jabba the hutt meets ghostbusters creature and i was sort of the bridge

4344699 do americans really want to give up their privacy and sense of dignity in public
4344700 i think they would only do that if there was some real evidence that it was going to make them safer
4344701 like what they did in london how they caught the terrorists because they had cameras on the bus i totally support that you have to give up a little bit of your freedom for safety
4344702 if youre doing everything by the law then you have nothing to worry about and it will protect you
4344703 its not invasive id be all for paying the money to know im safe
4344704 with google insights for search you can compare search volume patterns across specific regions categories and time frames
4344705 i first got interested in this topic because people were telling me that the air fresheners in public restrooms and the scent from laundry products vented outdoors were making them sick
4344706 i was surprised by both the number and the potential toxicity of the chemicals that were found
4344707 nearly 100 volatile organic compounds were emitted from these six products and none were listed on any product label plus five of the six products emitted one or more carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants which are considered by the environmental protection agency to have no safe exposure level
4344708 be careful if you buy products with fragrance because you really dont know whats in them
4344709 id like to see better labeling in the meantime id recommend that instead of air fresheners people use ventilation and with laundry products choose fragrance free versions
4344710 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come has a major disappointment
4344711 the figure came as a surprise as it was much higher than what we were expecting we were expecting it to be around 12 3 per cent it wont be surprising if the central bank will take further measures to reduce the excess liquidity
4344712 there was definitely some amount of nervousness in the market today especially during the last few hours of trade there could have been people who knew the figure before hand and or some of them might be playing it safe before the long weekend ahead

4344746 we colonize suns or rather the life envelope around suns that was the idea anyway most suns are unlikely to have suitable planets and terraforming of the ones that do have would take centuries were not interested we stopped being a planet bound species two centuries before we left our own solar system why should we want to climb back down the gravity well there was no evidence of other intelligent life out there and the habitat inhabitants wanted away from the restrictions of system government
4344747 a few writers have speculated that the sysgov wanted to get rid of us as badly as we wanted to see the back of them
4344748 miran stayed on miran there was once talk of colonizing other planets around other stars but when we failed to exceed the speed of light and discovered that the nearest star our suns companion had no planets of suitable size and potential habitability interest turned back to the miran system even the ideas about making other insystem planets habitable to miran were abandoned many years ago the furthest beside this expedition that weve been was an automated probe to the companion star less than one in forty thousand miran ventures into space at all our few industries struggle to find personnel if the people of your last habitat were friendly and prepared to work up there they could have been welcomed
4344749 if ancient history is to be believed humankind nearly turned inwards space was too big too expensive too remote from the problems we had on our own world then the space habitat and the ideas of increasing the surface area within them changed the equation

4344767 you mean duchess harrington after she got away from statesec at cerberus milady

4344769 i suppose thats true milady on the other hand the fact that comet s only a dispatch boat is probably going to keep anyone from thinking were any kind of significant threat which ought to keep any fingers off the launch button at least long enough to ask us what we think were doing
4344770 of course there was one other small difference about her graces arrival and ours
4344771 at that point no one had mdms so she had a lot more distance to play with before anyone could get into range of her ships
4344772 milady i couldve gone all morning without your reminding me of that particular little difference

4344779 courts have long recognized that even speech that is intended and likely to produce violence may not be criminalized unless the violence is imminent

4344791 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
4344792 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response

4344916 sacred tradition and sacred scripture then are bound closely together and communicate one with the other
4344917 sacred scripture is the speech of god as it is put down in writing under the breath of the holy spirit
4344918 and holy tradition transmits in its entirety the word of god which has been entrusted to the apostles by christ the lord and the holy spirit
4344919 does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy scriptures alone
4344920 in catholic doctrine there exists an order or hierarchy 234 of truths since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the christian faith

4344988 lets get away to the other side of the lake
4344989 rats ill never be a big league player i just dont have it all my life ive dreamed of playing in the big leagues but i know ill never make it
4344990 charlie brown youre thinking too far ahead what you need to do is set yourself more immediate goals
4344991 yes start with this next inning when you go out to pitch see if you can walk out to the mound without falling down
4344992 jesus went with jairus the ruler of the synagogue whose twelve year old daughter was ill and at the point of death and all the people followed crowding around him
4344993 a woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding she had suffered a great deal from many doctors and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them but she had gotten no better in fact she had gotten worse
4344994 he said you havent been using my electric drill have you i said no and he found his electric drill and crawled back under the car the line on the drill caught under a tire
4344995 there was a loud bump as daddy hit the car with his head he came out from under that car fast he jumped up and down and shook his fingers he yelled dammitalltohell i jumped up and down and shook my fingers i laughed and said dammitalltohell
4344996 daddy spanked me i dont know why mom doesnt believe spanking does any good daddy doesnt think spanking does any good what would daddy do if he believed in spanking
4344997 because of their unbelief jesus couldnt do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them and he was amazed at their unbelief
4344998 jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to nazareth his hometown
4344999 the next sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue and many who heard him were amazed
4345000 from ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go boomp in the night good lord deliver us
4345001 daniel dont be afraid god has listened to your prayers since the first day you humbly asked for understanding and he has sent me here but the guardian angel of persia opposed me for twenty one days then michael who is one of the strongest guardian angels came to rescue me from the kings of persia
4345002 we wanted very much to come to you in thessalonica and i paul tried again and again but satan prevented us
4345003 we are not fighting against humans we are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world
4345004 therefore take up the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore 3x having girded your waist with truth having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace
4345005 above all taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one often those are doubts and could include temptations
4345006 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit praying in tongues
4345007 look i dont want to be an asshole here but ive had a change of heart on the halibut im now going scottish salmon well done
4345008 you dont have any veggies for my veggie burrito then what could you substitute
4345009 no i dont want any chicken but let me ask isnt the majority of a veggie burrito the veggies
4345010 so you just charged me 5 dollars for a bean and cheese burrito
4345011 well you can have chicken if you want plus you get red sauce
4345012 hes on the same page as everyone else just in a different book
4345013 oh yeah duh im an idiot it was right there all along
4345014 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4345015 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4345016 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4345017 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4345018 surround yourself with beautiful people and the rest can go fuck themselves
4345019 people put you down enough you start to believe it
4345020 i think you are a very bright very special woman
4345021 the bad stuff is easier to believe you ever notice that
4345022 she loved him like he was the last man on earth gave him everything she ever had hed break her spirit down then come rubbing up on her give a little then take it back
4345023 you can ask me what ever you want i can hear you and i understand you but i dont feel like doing it
4345024 eric you have to do what your slp tells you everyone wants to help you improve and we really would like to hear you talk again in order for you to do so you need to practice now could you please try to say aaaaaa
4345025 im not even coming to watch the next session im just waiting for someone to call me
4345026 man at the worlds i probably was at the bottom as far as emotions and my morale
4345027 i knew i had to get back on it so i started working hard and everything just paid off man lot of prayer and lot hard work and it got me to this point
4345028 things go easier you have more fun im going to continue to just ride it out
4345029 and what i have to do to give myself the best chance to win
4345030 tex has given us an added dimension with his power from both sides and his ability to get on base
4345031 hes brought something to that grouping in front of torii hunter and garret anderson
4345032 there were a couple of pitches i left out over the plate that i wish i could take back
4345033 i felt a little sluggish but my body has woken up now
4345034 every time i breathe it hurts but its a case of mind over matter
4345035 i personally think hes the best coach in the history of the league and wed be lucky if we can get him here that said hes not the coach of the galaxy cobi is thats the way it is as of today
4345036 you just prepare yourself the only thing you do different is vary your work in between starts ive never had a problem with pitch counts
4345037 thats the hardest ive seen z get hit in the last two years ive been here i thought hed throw the ball better but it happens to anybody the cardinals are a good hitting team
4345038 we believe in these guys i believe in these guys
4345039 hes been the stopper for us ever since hes been back
4345040 i was a very strong candidate and it was a tough decision for the panel
4345041 portland never gets hot its only hot here like two days out of the year
4345042 we see snails as being a nuisance pest in the aquariums
4345043 ill come back when you call me no need to say goodbye
4345044 as iraq gets better and better it will allow for force reductions
4345045 conditions now are looking as if the fundamental change of mission will be able to take place next year
4345046 from a uk point of view were getting pretty close to achieving what we went there to do to be honest
4345047 it gets channels into areas where the water flows away from the beach through the surf zone
4345048 when the lifeguards put up a red flag its for a reason
4345049 anyone who swims in the atlantic or pacific oceans gulf of mexico or great lakes needs to know what a rip current is capable of and how to react if caught
4345050 residents of land locked states need to pay particular attention to this threat as they are more likely to be unfamiliar with rip currents
4345051 i like the idea of having a central park and baseball in one place and people being able to walk to downtown rather than just a stadium for spring training we can revitalize that part of downtown
4345052 regardless of whatever happens with baseball this property was purchased at a great price and we are getting an adult businesses offline and a tire shop that has been closed
4345053 we appreciate and are encouraged by the ongoing effort of both the elected officials and community leaders to collaborate on a plan that addresses our criteria to provide the ultimate spring training experience for our players and for our fans
4345054 we do not want to impact the park that is a community asset
4345055 initially there might be some opposition if the public thinks we are taking away from the park this is strictly adjacent to and complementing the park
4345056 as of now the owners dont even know this was a government deal
4345057 across the state were seeing positive signs for floridas housing market
4345058 realtors are reporting heightened interest from buyers more business activity and an increase in pending sales
4345059 as long as the united states economy has bright prospects and particularly as long as florida has good prospects its very hard i think to make a case for a long term picture thats negative
4345060 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack we do it ourselves and we spend a lot of time at it ive participated in the hiring of maybe 5 000 plus people in my life so i take it very seriously you cant know enough in a one hour interview so in the end its ultimately based on your gut how do i feel about this person what are they like when theyre challenged why are they here i ask everybody that why are you here the answers themselves are not what youre looking for its the meta data
4345061 i just wonder what the situation would have been like if it was a normal party with no alcohol
4345062 it directly contributed to creating a situation and environment that led to some kind of anger and ejection and a domino chain of events
4345063 whole thing could have been avoided if the parents were acting like responsible adults
4345064 the co conspirator used the proceeds to among other things finance domestic and international travel purchase real estate a piano jewelry clothing and wine make significant charitable contributions to a church and its food pantry pay down mortgages and provide financial support to family members
4345065 since then he has done everything he can to atone for what he did in terms of assisting in the investigation
4345066 it will be appealed it doesnt mean anything what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first
4345067 i think its a lot of vindication for what we have been talking about since april
4345068 state revenues generating an equivalent hold harmless amount for schools
4345069 the limitation on the implementation of the hold harmless amount is a material fact of which the voter must be given notice if the title and summary are to meet
4345070 requirement that the voter be given fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4345071 i dont think theres anything constitutionally wrong with mixing things
4345072 but they raised the bar by having to explain it
4345073 with 25 members and with everyone having different ideas and with certain people in the group wanting to make sure his gets in its very difficult to get meaningful language in an amendment
4345074 homeownership is a fundamental right and floridians deserve a say on how their property is taxed
4345075 we are shocked that the court decided to deny property owners the ability to dramatically lower their property tax rates
4345076 i came here to play defense but after all the moving around offense to defense defense to offense i wasnt happy at all and i thought about leaving for a little bit
4345077 i sat down and talked it over with my parents and coach
4345078 coach joe paterno was very honest with me he said look you could be an nfl player as a nose guard but i think you could be a 10 year guy at center i took his word i trusted him
4345079 i knew it was a place i could help the team i knew it was a place where i could get on the field more i knew it was a place i could start im glad i listened i actually love offense about 10 times more than defense now
4345080 shipley wasnt happy about it at the time he was a natural nose guard i think its worked out and i think hes happy with it
4345081 it was a good move for the team because shipley has become a real strong leader hes a bright kid good worker and we needed some leadership on offense
4345082 this is one of the meanest offensive lines ive seen here and it all starts with a q
4345083 were feeling good were very excited for the season to get under way we think we can do some big things this year
4345084 you only go as far as the offensive line takes you
4345085 the reasons for the decrease in earnings are well known
4345086 managing this highly challenging situation is currently the primary focus of the sas group and the entire air travel industry
4345087 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4345088 we are applying for eu us antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the us and where rival alliances have immunity
4345089 it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4345090 be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4345091 fuel expenses showed a sharp increase of 80 4 triggered by a soaring fuel price and a weakening korean won
4345092 during the second quarter el al faced the challenge of the international crisis in aviation
4345093 fuel prices continued to soar by about 80 year over year during the quarter the fuel component represented close to 40 of flight expenses and resulted in a significant growth in company expenditure
4345094 ever increasing completion characterized by the increase in seating capacity offered by foreign carriers
4345095 reflects the importance we attach to the engine control system in optimizing engine performance
4345096 magistrado y a d nde voy no conozco la direcci n de mi casa

4345099 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
4345100 rats have almost no bones and are quite rich in nutrition people at large dont know this cuisine fact but gradually they are catching up
4345101 yes that proposal is in its advance stage and well very soon engage them in various social activities of our department
4345102 1954 a word or phrase that results from a mishearing of something said or sung
4345103 you go here with scout ill go there with tucker and daisy then youll drop scout with me and take chester there and ill drop off daisy at her party and then well meet at home for lunch before the afternoon starts
4345104 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization
4345105 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4345106 daphne its just 2 shepards hooks move them and be done with it
4345107 my wife and i were wondering what to start training our 10 month old boy in so that hes ready for 2012
4345108 as hes small and shouts a lot do you think being the cox of the rowing eight would be a good target
4345109 has anyone actually thought to measure the pool to check that it is indeed the required 50m just a thought
4345110 why not superimpose brad pitts head on phelps for tv the greatest athlete in the world but lets face it those ears the dorky grin substitution warranted i dont mean that brad pitt should get the medals although perhaps he could have a copy
4345111 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
4345112 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
4345113 gezien zijn activiteiten in het verleden lijkt ons dit de verstandigste weg
4345114 logically speaking the most successful long term solution to everglades pollution may be to buy out the polluters and currently that option appears viable
4345115 delay may indeed be the enemy of the everglades but paradoxically there is no quick fix for its problems
4345116 i dont think theres any doubt that they need the funds for the acquisition right now
4345117 this ruling makes it clear that there is a full judicial endorsement that this acquisition of u s sugar is the best big picture long term solution
4345118 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4345119 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4345120 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4345121 our checks indicate that demand for the iphone remains very robust and we continue to expect that iphone sales will ramp with improved availability throughout the quarter note that we have seen a major improvement in iphone availability in the us starting 7 28 but we still do not expect supply to completely meet demand until september especially in light of the increased distribution both in the us through best buy and abroad
4345122 we estimate at least 8 3 million iphones could be sold in fiscal 1q09 december with 24 2 million sold in fy09 both estimates look very conservative note that apple expects to be selling the 3g iphone in over 70 countries by the end of calendar 2008 note that upside to iphone sales should boost apples free cash flow we believe shares are very undervalued on this metric
4345123 it does not appear that apple is overly concerned at this time we dont believe this is a material problem at this point and still believe that demand is extremely strong with expanding distribution worldwide
4345124 we are citizens of a great country on the verge of bold advance and we have to live up to that high standard all of us to whatever religion we may belong are equally the children of india with equal rights privileges and obligations
4345125 some times you pick the moment and sometimes the moment picks you
4345126 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4345127 not yet i hope to some day before i get too old
4345128 the sensitivity of the described assay is better than the typical mammalian sense of smell and is able to detect this nonvolatile amine at hazardous levels before the fish would begin to smell rancid
4345129 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
4345130 jetzt sollten wir eigentlich gl cklich sein dass sich die us regierung nicht l nger einer verbindlichen vorgabe zur halbierung der treibhausgas emissionen bis zum jahr 2050 widersetzt
4345131 das lhc ist eine gewaltige chance unser wissen ber das universum zu erweitern aber viele menschen scheinen anstatt dieser enormen m glichkeiten lieber irreale gefahren zu sehen
4345132 manchmal kommt es mir vor als ob man jene am liebsten auf dem scheiterhaufen verbrennen m chte die es wagen den sinn von impfungen in frage zu stellen

4345159 no lets just have a dirty fuck and we can shower later
4345160 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
4345161 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
4345162 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
4345163 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
4345164 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there
4345165 an intoxicating mix of brilliant industrial design transcendent software interfaces and consumable goods that are purely digital
4345166 apple could have stumbled meeting demand or failed on quality it did neither
4345167 when the itunes activation server went down on friday morning apple violated the cardinal rule first do no harm
4345168 fraught with problems including large initial downtime an extended e mail outage including lost messages the inability to contact the service to sync corruption of data time delays in syncing the computer to mobileme and more
4345169 apples mobileme designed for consumers could be potential headache for it managers
4345170 apple has always made great products and they always expect to be phenomenally successful at launch but i think the appetite in the public for this kind of product is probably surprising
4345171 but this one may have some effects thanks to the outsized press coverage that apple launches typically command

4345173 dont you let this bullshit happen again because it is just utter bullshit
4345174 anjis sweet sweet sweet sweet voice i remember the first time i ever heard her way back in the day i said she could read me a chinese menu or the phone book and i would be all happy
4345175 anjis voice wouldnt be out of place in a smoky jazz or blues bar somewhere down in a dimly lit cellar sultry with a voice like syrupy silky satin with a marshmallow middle and a honey topping
4345176 cosiness abounds as the silken voiced anji bee lead singer of chillout band lovespirals pours a cocktail of mellow dance music mmm
4345177 if youre looking for a different brand of grown and sexy in the podcast world check out anji bee this young lady is bringing it from production to her voice to the music selection she is doing her thazizzle
4345178 no other voice in the podosphere is more sultry than anji bee
4345179 enjoying the chillcast its seriously awesome i listen to them like over and over again
4345180 i just love the tunes anji bee selects and her comments on them i no longer have to search for music to be creative i just susbcribe to the chillcast
4345181 like having a cocktail of lovely tunes and honey poured directly into your ear well chosen music voice links that make you feel cosy inside it all adds up to an essential weekly download
4345182 we needed to come out with fire they woke up a sleeping dragon
4345183 at the end of the day we dont go home and write it down
4345184 you have to look at each match and each set the winning streak will come if you do that its built slowly like the great wall
4345185 if youre looking to make good money in the online casinos field you need an internet presence and a great website
4345186 im floored this online casinos news is shocking but also somewhat exciting to hear
4345187 i can say with little doubt that this online casinos argument is sound
4345188 and i believe this will be a cornerstone in online casinos thinking
4345189 i want to see the grant application for this one
4345190 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4345191 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4345192 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4345193 historic cemeteries definitely have to be treated special you might say that you have to use appropriate techniques to care for them to keep their historic integrity a management plan is definitely essential for historical cemeteries of what can and cant you do and whose going to take care of what aspect
4345194 the parks commission was really open responsive to what i presented to them today so hopefully between all of us well be able to think about it and ill be able to work at looking at the other cemeteries and maybe developing a management plan that well be able to come back together and figure out what is right for the cemetery
4345195 i figured it was a mix up with the holidays the weekend or whatever
4345196 i hope i got netflix because the kids would be disappointed
4345197 i hope we get them in the next couple of days or ill be very disappointed
4345198 we shipped no dvds on tuesday and have partial shipping wednesday and partial shipping thursday
4345199 it is good for a man not to touch a woman
4345200 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body which are gods
4345201 whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god
4345202 its my life and i will live it the way i want
4345203 with my whole heart have i sought thee o let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee
4345204 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a women to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
4345205 men arent too look upon the temptation but women arent to be the temptation
4345206 dont dress in a way to give them dirty thoughts
4345207 and thou shalt love the lord they god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment
4345208 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4345209 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4345210 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4345211 theyre trying obviously to get instant replay before the season ends
4345212 were having some discussions its coming at some point its more a question of when and how than whether
4345213 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4345214 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4345215 i switched from my dress sweats to my parka shoes threw my cap and goggles on and then they pushed us on out no time
4345216 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4345217 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4345218 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4345219 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4345220 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4345221 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4345222 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4345223 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4345224 i really couldnt breathe that last 50 i was just digging deep and couldnt breathe
4345225 a silver medal is still a silver medal in the olympics i gave it everything i couldnt have given more
4345226 april is showing others that christianity is more than a job but a lifestyle
4345227 am i showing others that christianity is a daily lifestyle you must try to uphold or that it is a easy job just to escape hell
4345228 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4345229 a skill development corporation will be created by the government with the active participation of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women our workers and our technicians
4345230 scholarships for overseas studies are being given to sc and st students
4345231 the reserve bank of india is taking all steps to control the rate of money supply so that prices are controlled but in taking these steps we need to keep in mind that we do not do anything which hurts the growth rate
4345232 i saw the central bank of indias camp at safdarjung airport
4345233 we are willing to offer the loan to any applicant who produces required documentation and pay upfront an interest of rs 5 680 that includes the interest rate of 10 per cent service charge stamp paper cost and miscellaneous charges
4345234 not only do banks get interest on rs 1 5 lakh but also gets the opening to deal with that customers home loan if he gets lucky
4345235 we have set up camps near safdarjung airport at central school in safdarjung and opposite vikas sadan because not many people know about our scheme
4345236 i am certain that two other banks will introduce a similar scheme by next week
4345237 we are just waiting for a fixed policy we will most likely start such a scheme by next tuesday or latest by wednesday
4345238 it there was a rate of interest most customers would come for a loan at the last minute around september 18 when the scheme ends they would then have to pay interest for a shorter duration thats why it makes sense to offer it at a fixed amount
4345239 i think it is a fair deal paying a one time interest of rs 6 000 sounds like a good bargain especially if i get lucky at the draw
4345240 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country
4345241 it the agreement will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4345242 many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered
4345243 we must find alternative energy sources i would like our scientists and engineers to find ways in which we can make better use of solar energy wind energy bio gas and other sources of energy
4345244 our economy must grow at the rate of at least 10 per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all a basic requirement for sustained growth and for the development of our agriculture and industry is availability of energy particularly electricity
4345245 the firing of rockets did take place this morning and it is a major incident but since the rockets were targeted at bsf positions the army is yet to ascertain the details of the incident
4345246 there were a couple of rounds of mortar fire by pakistani troops at our positions in mandi of poonch sector
4345247 when they say hes not one of us you dont say heres our plan on health care
4345248 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
4345249 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4345250 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4345251 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4345252 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4345253 the problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove our efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve health care services for all citizens will continue
4345254 we have strengthened the sarva shiksha abhiyan and expanded the mid day meal programme upto upper primary level in all districts of the country
4345255 issues related to this sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill
4345256 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4345257 we cannot think only for ourselves we cannot think only about survival from day to day from year to year and from one election to another
4345258 major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country

4345266 do you ever wonder why some people are better than you in math
4345267 one should not practice only the day before the math long test but he should solve exercises every day the more familiar a student is in answering the exercises the more is he confident in answering different kinds of problems
4345268 you must always be inspired in doing math problems have something to motivate you do not give up if you dont understand the lesson you just need to keep on trying

4345273 my decision to leave manchester city last summer has paid off because i have got straight back into the premiership at the first attempt
4345274 i am a lot different as a player and a person now to how i was 12 months ago and hopefully i can show that
4345275 he is a great player with great strengths there are a lot of players in the premier league that you can take tips off and hopefully i will be able to become one of those top strikers
4345276 kev is a great player and his departure puts more pressure on the rest of the strikers to score
4345277 despite recent upward trend in food grains production indias food security remains an area of concern
4345278 there is consequently a challenging task ahead in bridging the demand supply gap by accelerating the pace of domestic production of food grains
4345279 crop intensity and area under cultivation have shown a decline
4345280 issues related to this sacred place especially the issue of providing the best possible facilities to pilgrims can only be resolved in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill
4345281 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4345282 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of j and k in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4345283 dividing people in the name of religion can complicate these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity of the country
4345284 we cannot think only for ourselves we cannot think only about survival from day to day from year to year and from one election to another
4345285 major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country
4345286 a renewed focus on a strong balance sheet strategic acquisitions operational efficiency sound management practices as well as attracting and retaining the best workforce are the key to future growth during turbulent economic times
4345287 i am not going to give up the dream of both koreas living well together
4345288 kabul embassy attack has cast shadow on indo pak ties
4345289 terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world
4345290 cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in the region
4345291 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control
4345292 a skill development corporation will be created by the government with the active participation of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women our workers and our technicians
4345293 scholarships for overseas studies are being given to sc and st students national merit cum means scholarships for children hailing from economically weaker sections and children with disabilities have also been approved
4345294 pepes probably one of the best at penalty saves and youve got to be really confident when hes up against one because of his record
4345295 it was a harsh decision though but then again ive heard that the other one was over the line so maybe theyve cancelled each other out
4345296 we know we didnt play as well as we can and they did well so we have to be pleased to get out of it with a nil nil
4345297 we probably didnt deserve it but thats football and over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same
4345298 its definitely not over though we know itll be another tough game next time and its very important that we dont let them get an away goal when they come to anfield
4345299 these games are as difficult as playing in quarter finals and semi finals just due to the fact that you dont really know the teams that you are up against
4345300 its that surprise element that you dont really get when youre playing against the big teams and they certainly gave us a scare but we now definitely know what theyre capable of
4345301 its never a bad result in europe to come away and get a clean sheet and now weve done that we have to go on and do the business at anfield
4345302 over the years weve struggled in these qualifiers which is not what you would want and we would certainly take it if we can get through now and go on to do what weve done in the champions league in the past
4345303 hes a really really confident lad but you cant get that confused with arrogance
4345304 he works hard hell put tackles in and hes always looking to talk to you and see whats happening
4345305 hes not one of them who thinks hes a maradona
4345306 i know there have been a lot of questions asked was he forced out the door etc etc
4345307 but the clear fact is we sent out on the website an honest statement by the chief executive martin bain explaining the situation
4345308 but then people want to read into it and put their own twist on it theres not a lot we can do
4345309 people are putting that on websites knowing theres no truth in it at all but just endeavouring to cause mayhem
4345310 were disappointed to lose carlos but as i said the other day well take the money and spend it hopefully wisely in the short term
4345311 but it would have been a lot better if wed known this two or three weeks ago
4345312 then we would have had some more time rather than rushing around trying to get a replacement
4345313 the time has gone now when we bring players into the club who just want to pick up their wages
4345314 team spirit is really good because everyone is on the same wages we dont have superstars who earn three or four times more than everyone else so the players are all pushing towards the same target
4345315 we are all the same age group and have the same interests everyone talks to everyone else and that is good for spirit there are no real stars now who get exceptional treatment
4345316 we feel like a real group and that is what we need this season that is where we will be different from other teams
4345317 what has changed as well is that we only have players here who want to be at the club and achieve things in their career
4345318 big name players who just want their wages and dont want to achieve anything those times have gone it makes me very proud to be captain of a club with such a philosophy
4345319 we have spent a few million in the transfer market but we cannot compete with spurs who will spend millions on one transfer
4345320 hopefully we can prove that our system can work as well and we can also play good football if we can do that it would be far more enjoyable for the supporters because there will be many home grown players here
4345321 there is a lot of fuss about spurs because they have changed a lot of things and brought in a lot of signings
4345322 you played really well last night i think it is easier with three players than two
4345323 if he wants to come and talk to us he is more than welcome
4345324 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on you just cannot continue to increase debts
4345325 i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch the owner has already invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60million on players alone
4345326 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates
4345327 i have played with him for argentina and against him when i was at real mallorca and he played for depor
4345328 hes a very good player and now its good that he is to become a newcastle player
4345329 i see it quite simply i signed a year contract there is the option of a second year there ive got no intention of playing my football at any other club from now until the end of my footballing days
4345330 obviously i can never say for sure that that is going to happen because you never know in football but ive got a good relationship with the manager its a great club to work for and the fans are great
4345331 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people
4345332 i will keep going with what i do best and going into my third season i have the feeling that i want to make it here
4345333 i havent had a chance to speak with arsene wenger but i have been training with the physio to improve my fitness levels
4345334 it would be good to play against him but manchester united have a lot of other quality players it is not just carlos they have players like ryan giggs and michael carrick playing
4345335 there are so many more important players involved in the game
4345336 a lei traz evolu es para a qualidade do est gio pois foca o processo como um ato educativo e estabelece limites para as possibilidades de abusos

4345345 distin and campbell are two really good defenders so for me its a good challenge but thats normal you have competition in the team and thats sport not only football so i need to work and take my chance
4345346 i have seen them play i saw many games for portsmouth last year and they are a really strong team at the back distin and campbell work very well for the team and make it solid
4345347 they are good defenders and work well together but i am ready to be patient ive come here to work in training if i play its good but i am here for a long time
4345348 carlton cole did last season well and young freddie has looked good in pre season
4345349 were doing our best but if these deals dont happen i dont think im in a position to complain
4345350 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4345351 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault

4345369 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
4345370 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4345371 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4345372 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4345373 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
4345374 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4345375 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4345376 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4345377 if i feel like a sore throat is coming on
4345378 there is no credible evidence that airborne products will reduce the severity or duration of colds or provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4345379 its important to note that this is a settlement over older advertising and labeling and has nothing to do with public safety
4345380 weve offered a money back guarantee for our products since 1997 and we have millions of satisfied customers a class action lawsuit sparked this matter were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4345381 the fact they got away with it for years is not a reason they should not be held responsible for it
4345382 even if airborne isnt doing anything for you believing it helps
4345383 i cant tell you the last time i had a cold
4345384 it is pretty much impossible to prove that it didnt prevent a cold if you dont get a cold

4345427 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4345428 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17
4345429 this is probably a result of poor information given to the athlete involved
4345430 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50m a little bit and try to get out to an early lead
4345431 i knew that it was a hard double for ryan lochte

4345433 i have been eating mcdonalds here virtually for every meal
4345434 we never saw one another we were always busy but we had this weekly date always at four oclock in the hammock
4345435 what shes doing here is what youd find in her parents garden in england
4345436 we like water and we cant live near the water so we built with water

4345447 we all need time to be alone to think to dream to wonder
4345448 we all know someone who has made a call or sent a message when they are drunk which perhaps they wish they hadnt done the morning after
4345449 however from the amount of messages sent in the past 12 months it seems a lesson rarely learned even when its hitting our pickets as well as our love lives
4345450 its good to see the digital age isnt by passing the older generation although its surprising to see they are as bad as those in their 20s when it comes to saucy calls and texts
4345451 i cannot understand whether they are just being lazy by refusing to help her or whether it is political correctness gone mad but i can guarantee this policy gives her no independence or dignity
4345452 i have found her twice covered in food trying to eat the meal she has got on her nightgown my father has found her several times too and so has one of my brothers it is not hygienic especially as she has c diff and we have also found her sitting in her own food
4345453 she is very weak from the bug and she does not have good health anyway she has had very good medical care in the hospital but the standard of personal care is totally unacceptable
4345454 we are sorry the family have had cause to raise concerns
4345455 when we treat patients we try to let them maintain as much independence as possible and at meal times this may lead to food spills if a patients hand movements are unsteady
4345456 we encourage patients to eat well during their stay and monitor them regularly to make sure that any issues are addressed
4345457 in mrs langs case we have increased the level of support and supervision during meal times this involves a staff member being in attendance at meal times to offer assistance as and when she requires it and to ensure that any spillage is cleared up promptly
4345458 the ward manager has discussed mrs langs meal arrangements in great detail with family members
4345459 ive been fighting the bnp for over 40 years so ive had my fair share of jibes and abuse but this frightened me
4345460 we are investigating a threat to kill recently made on a website we are following a number of inquiries
4345461 this man is going to have a very difficult time while hes going to be incarcerated
4345462 i have come to the conclusion that this attack does not have any particularly aggravating features such as the use of violence but it is an offence which must be visited by a term of imprisonment
4345463 i dont see why he should get off scot free while im left here with nothing
4345464 i turned to drink after what happened to try and blot it out
4345465 it was the only way i could sleep and everything spiralled from there i just want it dealt with so i can get on with my life
4345466 if enough of us join forces to collect recyclable waste and sell it on it could be quite lucrative
4345467 not only would it be good for the environment we could use the money to make small improvements to the streets where we live unlike the local council who must pay staff costs and delivery charges we wouldnt have any significant overheads
4345468 the value of a newspaper or steel can on its own is quite small but if you have a tonne of newspaper or steel then the transport costs and the processing costs start to make more economic sense
4345469 if you look back to the 1970s there was a time people were able to make a few pence on each bottle or can that they returned to the shop
4345470 but the culture has changed when i was a kid we had a deposit scheme for cans and bottles the reason why it was taken away was because people didnt think it was worth going back to the shop for 5p or 10p
4345471 those schemes fell out of use because they werent getting the volumes back its been found that its much more effective for local councils to offer kerbside collection
4345472 rather than people trying to make money themselves they should do what they can to ensure that local authority recycling schemes are as effective as possible
4345473 it costs 32 per tonne in landfill tax for a local authority to throw waste into a hole in the ground and that is going to increase by 8 per year until 2011
4345474 by the time that has been carried to the tip by the local council the cost has risen to 100 per tonne
4345475 the rotor blades and the propellers must have a ring around the perimeter so that they dont come into contact with the fingers of a child

4345477 theres still a problem i dont think its gone away the majority of the violence has gone away from the football grounds

4345480 the mineshaft is still there with its winding gear there are sheds full of equipment including steam driven machines lathes and other tools
4345481 the property has featured in the many television documentaries and films fred made about his life and his passion for our industrial heritage
4345482 unfortunately officers are regularly subjected to physical abuse broken bones and torn ligaments are relatively common
4345483 on two occasions officers have lost an eye as a result of being attacked the impact of something like that on the officers and their families is with them for the rest of their lives
4345484 i am not surprised that a fifth of victims are women some of the people we deal with have no respect for gender and dont tend to display gentlemanly behaviour
4345485 what the statistics show is that no matter how much protective equipment we give our officers they are still liable to be hurt in an attack body armour cant protect you from a punch in the face which breaks your nose
4345486 we are there to help people not to be assaulted and abused
4345487 macforce has been a great partner for softpress and im sure this will be a fantastic day for everyone

4345492 the basic problem is that the people who are acquiring these properties they dont understand or want to understand that tenants have rights in san francisco
4345493 you cant just go in and tell them to leave you cant shut off utilities you cant call the police you cant do any of that stuff
4345494 i didnt know where to go or who to go to
4345495 we are aware that they have approached many organizations and agencies and have tried to portray manhattan realty group as this evil company

4345497 i left that for them because i knew the banks ultimate wish is for them to be kicked out
4345498 were more than willing to help our customers who are in difficult situations with their landlords
4345499 there has been a lot of talk about the impact of the housing crisis on property owners however tenants are the underreported victims
4345500 unlike homeowners who know that their home is at risk renters have no warning before the power is turned off or someone is at the door telling them they need to pack up and move by the next day
4345501 oh hi guys can any of you strapping young gentlemen tell me if this is the house of maromeye96xoxo

4345504 people like mal brough and others have said all the women like it the intervention and the men dont that is not the case
4345505 the thing is we now see indigenous minister jenny macklin our new minister doing an agreement with cape york where these ideas sort of emanated from people quarantining and going through the system and what not
4345506 the whole thing was about this being dealt with with people who werent looking after their kids or were habitual drunks etc
4345507 they were the people who were to be targeted here we had the whole of the northern territory just one stroke of the pen and everyone was caught up in it
4345508 the government has committed itself to over 700 million in this area their commitment is there it will be rolled out soon
4345509 the minister only said that just a couple of weeks ago that you are looking at over 400 communities and you are going to have 400 responses
4345510 i challenge anyone in the cafe latte drinking set of sydney and everyone else if you have those sort of statistics in a suburb of sydney that you are not going to send the police in

4345543 it may take longer but i am confident the result will be the same and that i will win again
4345544 it took me some time to get over the first fight but no matter what anybody says it was a loss for me it went into the books as a defeat
4345545 i couldnt have trained harder for that fight but i learned a lesson i learned that no matter how hard i worked at it it was time to take this sport even more seriously

4345602 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4345603 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4345604 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4345605 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4345606 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4345607 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4345608 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4345609 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4345610 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4345621 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4345622 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4345623 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4345652 lo que me sorprendi escribe obama es lo modestas que eran las esperanzas de la gente y lo mucho que ten an en com n independientemente de su raza procedencia religi n y clase social la mayor a cre a que cualquiera que estuviera dispuesto a trabajar deber a poder encontrar un trabajo con el cual ganarse la vida pensaba que la gente no deber a tener que declararse en bancarrota por el solo hecho de enfermarse pensaba que todos los ni os ten an el derecho a recibir una buena educaci n que eso no deber a quedarse solo en palabras vanas y que esos mismos ni os deber an poder ir a la universidad aunque sus padres no fueran ricos quer an sentirse seguros a salvo tanto de delincuentes como de terroristas quer an aire limpio agua limpia y poder pasar tiempo con sus hijos cuando fueran adultos quer an poder jubilarse con dignidad y respeto y b sicamente eso era todo no era demasiado

4345654 oh good its 3 a m and im wide awake
4345655 did i just have a back twitch i havent had one of them in ages
4345656 youre 60 goth thats more goth than 83 of the people whove taken this quiz so far
4345657 in a civilized society abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated
4345658 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4345659 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4345660 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4345661 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4345662 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4345663 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4345664 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4345665 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4345666 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4345667 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4345668 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4345669 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4345670 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4345671 chinese workers are a sign of change in aging japan
4345672 give a wise man instructions and hell be yet wiser
4345673 give a wise man instructions and money and hell be yet like pak lah and his cronies
4345674 give a wise man instructions money and religion hell be yet stupid as a goon
4345675 i like real flowers theres too much plastic stuff around our world anyway i think they add to the beauty of a city i think summers a good time for flowers
4345676 this is a great opportunity to get a free sampling of classes without the enrollment process
4345677 a cook county department of highways road improvement project coming soon
4345678 putting your tax dollars to work todd h stroger president board of county commissioners
4345679 the question is what purpose does it serve does the road get fixed better
4345680 its nothing but advertising for the county board president at some point therell be a new president and all the signs will have to be switched over its just goofy
4345681 the president has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining county roads
4345682 theres basically a fundamental misunderstanding about where the taxpayers funds are going
4345683 if we criticize him we have to criticize the other guys too
4345684 its not for promotion its letting you know whose office it is
4345685 clearly the irony alert wasnt on when they were drawing these things up
4345686 even when it rained halfway through we knew this was something that could be successful and become a family friendly event that everyone loves
4345687 if you have an established event that offers the same things every year thats great
4345688 but we are new and we want to see where we can go and what we can do
4345689 we really wanted to expand our services to the north side of the park
4345690 we just want to provide a nice space for people to come enjoy a good meal and enjoy their day at cantigny
4345691 this is a 40 foot outdoor bar the only outdoor bar in st charles
4345692 we will have sandwiches and entrees steak seafood and pasta
4345693 the main thing is that everything is made to order
4345694 im really pleased with the place and the way it has turned out
4345695 they got some old photos of rays and its patrons and they have them hanging on the walls so that was nice
4345696 john had always hoped that someday we could do something like this to rays
4345697 if john was still around hed be pretty pleased with this
4345698 in corporate terms he was the equivalent of the chief financial officer
4345699 he was a wizard at using the old adding machine he would work the machine with his right hand and hed be turning the checks he was adding up with his left hand and he would talk to you at the same time
4345700 he put in a budget system that made for a more mature financial operation and he was a wonderful brother to live with he always had a kind word and he remained interested in events up until the end
4345701 this is really the first green bank that weve done
4345702 if nothing else its jobs and its industry for the village
4345703 heres a step in the right direction hopefully other businesses will catch on to this as well
4345704 he is not going to be reimbursing for the search firm
4345705 we do expect that were going to be able to build on that same process we had its not like we have to start all over because we did do a search to hire betts and found numerous qualified candidates so they can still avail themselves to the process
4345706 the agreement recognizes that daniel is going to pursue other opportunities and the board is going to go in another direction
4345707 it is standard operating procedure for this district to examine what is on the computers that belong to the district
4345708 there was certainly nothing unlawful that was shown by any examination of any computer that mr betts touched
4345709 the passenger door was still able to open amazingly but the drivers side sustained a lot of damage
4345710 typically in an offset collision drivers sides get hit the worst
4345711 get well and stay well while you are in the hospital
4345712 i am honored and happy about the distinction but the truth is im apprehensive about being in the public eye
4345713 i have some experience though because on the fourth of july i was marshal of the hoffman estates parade and was amazed at how many people are on the sidelines i am overwhelmed to be honored by both villages
4345714 for this year only the parade will travel north on summit drive from hartford drive to stock port lane
4345715 it would be considerate for people to reserve just the space they need because we expect record crowds at this free event
4345716 i promise to smile and wave to the folks on both sides of the street
4345717 must encourage more students to take advanced placement courses so they are better prepared for postsecondary education and training
4345718 he came at me with a gun i was like what are you doing i pushed him it went off i freaked out i didnt know what to do
4345719 the certification process is a way for somebody outside to come in and make sure what we promised to do is being delivered
4345720 swim against the current even a dead fish can go with the flow
4345721 we dont like to have to raise the lunch cost
4345722 but we would have to be putting a lot of money out
4345723 when they said the price is going to go up i thought it would be more than this
4345724 my children and family situation is such now that my kids are older and ill have the time for a couple of years to travel throughout illinois but i want to wait and see how this fall goes for the republican party and see who else comes forward
4345725 so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the laywers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4345726 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4345727 someone who once made anti catholic quips for which he has long apologized
4345728 in the 21st century nations do not invade other nations
4345729 if you barely made it through the hell of a d 2007in america youre really going to be in trouble if anything bad ever happens
4345730 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
4345731 it would create some real delays for three or four elementary schools
4345732 people have taken many risks and made many sacrifices to be here and just because ice says come here they arent going to leave everything behind
4345733 if you watch this movie we want you to think about what youre laughing at its not funny
4345734 we are viewing this as the educational opportunity that it is
4345735 since his speech i havent used the word as much
4345736 a few people have said to me dont use that word
4345737 a lot of it is ignorance more than malice they dont know how much it hurts people with intellectual disabilities
4345738 theres no recognition that its very harmful to a significant amount of the population as many as 3 percent of the population has some type of intellectual disability
4345739 calling something a satire is not a get out of jail free card
4345740 at that moment he activated his lights the motorcycle went at an extremely high rate of speed and the officer lost sight of it
4345741 words were exchanged between the two groups and a fight ensued between the two groups
4345742 we were unable to charge other people because we were unable to get positive identifications from the victims in a lineup
4345743 theres still one more person we believe was involved that were looking for
4345744 principals with one copy machine in their building are very frustrated
4345745 i dont know how the little kids carry those backpacks
4345746 the idea of being more paperless has escaped us in education
4345747 we have record high debt unpaid bills fiscal mismanagement federal investigations
4345748 in six years we have accomplished a number of things that help people from investing a record amount of money toward education to making sure uninsured women can get mammograms and pap smears to raising the minimum wage twice to giving children health insurance and we have done all that without raising taxes the governor doesnt mind if he has to get beat up or bruised on behalf of the people because its provided results
4345749 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4345750 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4345751 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4345752 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4345753 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4345754 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4345755 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4345756 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4345757 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4345758 i know everything and im going to teach you everything
4345759 hold it a minute were going to do things differently
4345760 when i went to brazil i taught the people to garden
4345761 they had plenty of meat and rice and dairy products but no vegetables
4345762 were right now in the process of going in and putting angled steel reinforcement and making alternate connections there
4345763 the original contractor on the job has not been responding to letters from our attorney
4345764 it did collapse in the manner it was designed to collapse it just did not collapse when it was supposed to obviously
4345765 everything was progressing normally and then suddenly without warning a connection of one leg to the body seemed to fail
4345766 he has been following the board and we liked his experience
4345767 we liked what heide can contribute to the board moving forward
4345768 ive still got all those signs in my basement and you can only make so many yard sale signs with them so yes i would run again
4345769 i believe we need to assess where were at and where we want to be in five 10 15 20 years and develop a road map to get there so that were good stewards for the future generations of napervillians
4345770 and good judgment comes from having the ability to look at issues through the eyes of your constituents
4345771 each of them was passionate and has demonstrated how much they care about the park district and that was awesome to see
4345772 i hope they all try again because each of them would be valuable to us
4345773 we had some things from the house in storage and a little apartment but we basically were just starting from scratch all over again
4345774 were hosting this because we want to and its our passion
4345775 its not just a bike run its a gathering of people who are stepping up to the plate to do the right thing once you meet these veterans theres no turning back they just steal your heart

4345777 spirit whose work is done spirit of dreadful hours ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts yet onward ever unfaltering pressing spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene electric spirit that with muttering voice through the war now closed like a tireless phantom flitted rousing the land with breath of flame while you beat and beat the drum now as the sound of the drum hollow and harsh to the last reverberates round me as your ranks your immortal ranks return return from the battles while the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders while i look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders while those slanted bayonets whole forests of them appearing in the distance approach and pass on returning homeward moving with steady motion swaying to and fro to the right and left evenly lightly rising and falling as the steps keep time spirit of hours i knew all hectic red one day but pale as death next day touch my mouth ere you depart press my lips close leave me your pulses of rage bequeath them to me fill me with currents convulsive let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone let them identify you to the future in these songs

4345890 both have worked tirelessly for years to increase participation by previously underrepresented groups in our activity
4345891 i think that these two agree far more than they disagree about issues concerning the community and this seems to be just a small disagreement about differing strategies to reach the same end
4345892 unfortunately the way that the argument progressed both said and or did things that offend the taste of some people
4345893 earlier this year the westland meat recall raised the risk environment for every food and beverage company based on the size of the recall and the fact that the recall was driven by social concerns rather than purely health concerns established a new trend

4345908 with so many questionable legal situations and knowing that only the poor face execution it is crucial that we intensify our efforts to abolish the death penalty

4345928 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4345929 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4345930 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4345931 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4345932 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4345933 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4345934 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4345935 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4345946 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
4345947 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
4345948 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
4345949 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
4345950 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer

4345956 more obviously the sales growth in the sedan segment has cooled from more than 20 percent in the first quarter 10 percent in the second quarter to the current 1 6 percent
4345957 it steadily slowed in the first half but may see a vertical dive after july
4345958 there are too many adverse factors this year to dampen auto sales
4345959 new government tax measures and higher fuel prices were blamed for the unusual slowdown as well as consumers delaying their purchase because of the expectation of a price cut after the anti monopoly law implemented this month and their flagging enthusiasm in an uncertain stock market
4345960 the growth may ease further in the first half of next year to 2010 particularly if chinas economy slows and if oil prices continue surging

4346017 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4346018 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4346019 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4346020 we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4346021 as a house member from 1983 1995 ridge cast votes for a nuclear freeze and against the mx and trident ballistic missiles reagans strategic defense initiative and aid to the contras in nicaragua
4346022 its time to resolve one of our most divisive defense issues the strategic defense initiative sdi
4346023 sold to the american people as a way to make nuclear weapons obsolete sdi was still portrayed by president reagan last year as a defensive weapon that would make it virtually impossible for nuclear missiles to get through as former sen john tower acknowledged that vision is unrealistic frankly there has been a lot of dreaming that achieved a degree of acceptance because it was done in high places by people who know something about defense its left us with a serious defense problem
4346024 governor ridge is proud of his record and support of our nations defense while the governor voted to support elaborate weapons systems he also did not want to do so to the neglect of the soldier in the field

4346050 timing is crucial in this market and luckily we chose the right publishers for the job
4346051 this book speaks volumes about the impact of baseball betting in society and we knew from a business responsibility stand point that releasing it on time would really make a difference
4346052 i fully expect a sequel to be release within six months
4346053 typically we see interest wane a year after the initial release so it is important to stay on schedule and release subsequent books at pique points of public interest
4346054 i think sebree gatherss new docu novel leads readers astray there is too much focus on making the fictional characters function whereas more attention should have been paid to the facts
4346055 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things

4346057 and we expect to sell out very fast grabner penroses baseball betting book brought hundreds of pre sale orders and numerous bulk order requests so the question of whether or not well sell out is moot
4346058 in the literary world we seek to heighten public awareness about the baseball betting industry and how it works this is absolutely essential for those in the academic literary and research fields
4346059 because the work that has been done in the baseball betting literary area has been huge
4346060 it will be a top seller im sure and even though it is meant for those familiar with the baseball betting literary world many others may find it of general interest as well
4346061 but were doing it to make sure no unauthorized copies get resold we want to avoid plagiarism and pirating as much as possible furthermore this will be our new procedure for future releases by author schaller schwantes who has pledged support for this system
4346062 pre sale polls show this new baseball betting book doubling gross sales figures of other recent releases

4346101 we were contacted and contracted out by chicago public schools to start a baseball program for kids in the city at the middle schools fourth fifth and sixth grades
4346102 the real challenge there is theres no green space in englewood
4346103 theres not space for these kids to go and practice so finding space and then finding people whether its illinois baseball academy or teachers in the building finding people who are qualified and excited could be a challenge
4346104 englewood is probably one of the most notoriously gang infested and poverty stricken areas if once or twice a week baseball can provide an oasis and can be sort of an escape i have to do that
4346105 it really is about innocence and purity im not worried about performance enhancing drugs with these kids im not worried about whether or not they are developing bad attitudes that plague major league baseball

4346131 my main area of interest is conducting rigorous scientific evaluations of education policies so that we can better understand how to help students learn the mission of this board is to support and guide such important research
4346132 the national technical advisory council will play a vital role in ensuring that we address the technical needs of states and their accountability systems

4346137 its like an elvis show but more of jack in it than elvis
4346138 picture if you will an intimate space where the band talks to each other and asks mr foltyn questions that everyone else wanted to ask
4346139 i think everyone has a right to know what an artist goes through in life to get him where he is
4346140 i dont think people realize that we are such a different breed and this show explains all of that with music
4346141 we were encouraged to repatriate and were told that the afghan government would give us a house work and other facilities
4346142 we dont have a school here there is no hospital no electricity no transport no work
4346143 our children were going to school in pakistan but there is no school here
4346144 i dont think people will continue to live here because of all the problems we are facing
4346145 its not a job only for the morr various other government and non government bodies must take part in the efforts to help returnees reintegrate effectively
4346146 the dream that you are going to give a piece of land to everyone who comes back was false and should not have been shared because that dream does not exist
4346147 often returnees are allotted land 50km from urban areas in flood plains where returnees have no means of livelihood
4346148 many people are waiting to see hospitals roads schools electricity and other facilities in those areas and then move there
4346149 the criminals know there is something to gain for example kidnapping for ransom
4346150 they try not to carry papers and pens if you are literate you must work with an ngo
4346151 for example they dont take our own cars they travel in ordinary cars looking like ordinary people
4346152 there have not been any attacks on our staff but we feel that if we go outside the city we might be attacked by taliban kidnappers or other armed groups
4346153 ultimately violence against those who are trying to help afghans rebuild their lives will only caused greater suffering for the afghan people
4346154 pardon me could i borrow your grey poupon and how about some passionate lovemaking
4346155 yes but do you love me enough to stab me
4346156 thats his way of getting back at the world to create beautiful things and deny them to the public
4346157 this expansion will introduce mobile phone services to remote and war torn areas which lag far behind in the nations reconstruction efforts and for which telecom services are vital
4346158 it will give people in remote areas better access to markets access to information and will support families and communities that are often fragmented it will also be a great boost for the private sector by helping businesses access new parts of the country
4346159 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
4346160 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
4346161 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
4346162 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
4346163 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
4346164 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
4346165 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
4346166 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
4346167 if you have taken the flu shot more than 8 times in the last 10 years you have an 80 chance of getting alzheimers
4346168 from time to time rumors circulate that thimerosal a mercury based preservative once used in several vaccines and still used in some flu vaccine could contribute to asds however valid scientific studies have shown there is no link the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the cdc and the institute of medicine iom agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism
4346169 the author concludes that recent studies have found no association between mmr vaccination and autism the frequent embryologic neuroanatomic abnormalities found in children with autism lessen the likelihood that mmr immunization is a major risk factor the immunization safety review committee of the institute of medicine and a special american academy of pediatrics panel have concluded that evidence does not support mmr immunization as a risk factor for autism
4346170 on may 18th 2004 the institute of medicine iom released its eighth and final report from its immunization safety review committee based on a thorough review of clinical and epidemiological studies neither the mercury based vaccine preservative thimerosal nor the measles mumps rubella mmr vaccine are associated with autism says the new report furthermore the hypotheses regarding how the mmr vaccine and thimerosal could trigger autism lack supporting evidence and are theoretical only further research to find the cause of autism should be directed toward other lines of inquiry that are supported by current knowledge and evidence and offer more promise for providing an answer said the committee that wrote the report the american medical association ama lauds the process that went into the creation of this scientific report and applauds the iom and the cdc for their strong efforts in continuing to ensure the safety of the vaccines that are administered in the united states through post market surveillance and studies such as this
4346171 some people believe increased exposure to thimerosal from the addition of important new vaccines recommended for children explains the higher prevalence in recent years
4346172 the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal containing vaccines and autism

4346176 are you looking forward to watching the athletes compete in this summers olympic games in beijing or have political controversies cast a pall over the games spirited ideals
4346177 at first i didnt know that it was that serious but then we he wouldnt answer my questions
4346178 i kind of started getting really nervous is my husband alive
4346179 had those staircases not been sealed had that standpipe worked and they had water my family wouldnt have been broken
4346180 theres a lot of people at fault you know everybody will get whats coming to them
4346181 you know what goes around comes around and you know i dont mean to sound harsh and i am not an angry bitter person at all but the people who allowed this to happen it will eventually come back to them
4346182 i thought he was one of the best pure athletes that we saw in a long time playing the quarterback position
4346183 i think for me after a game you say good game to kids and as small and minute as the point may be a lot of times you shake the hand of a kid that just beat you single handily theyve got a grin this look
4346184 but with jon youd say good game and he was respectful a thank you i appreciate it coach those types of things
4346185 i think he really enjoyed the stage that he was performing on
4346186 he seemed to be an upbeat kid and had a lot of fun with what he was doing and of course the winning added more to it i think he set a real good example of how you can enjoy it and perform at the same time
4346187 he played his butt off and worked as hard as anybody on the court
4346188 when we went into the gym knowing we were playing west we said he was one of the kids maybe the kid to keep the ball out of his hands and look out for him defensively you knew he was going to come and get you every game
4346189 when you looked at pocono west last year theres a big circle that you put around mangual because he was a playmaker
4346190 he was a phenomenal athlete and every time you saw him on tape and every time you saw him in a game he was really the guy that had that unique ability to be right where the action was and to do what had to be done to make it go in favor of his team
4346191 they always say that football is a team sport but even in the ultimate team sport you have those unusual individuals who are capable of making great performances just when you need them and thats what he was he was outstanding
4346192 bill this is not about you it is about our community

4346194 who am i why am i here what am i supposed to do with my life
4346195 we didnt have four of our top six receivers but i thought jake operated pretty good for the weather conditions
4346196 it wasnt ideal as far as the offensive passing game
4346197 every time you step on the field you want to do something positive
4346198 i just want to show i can contribute on special teams and running the ball
4346199 i took a tough shot im a little buzzing right now
4346200 it was one of those things i was just trying to make a play and i took a shot my head isnt as bad a problem i think i hurt my ribs on that play it hurts a little more than i thought i would i pulled myself out after that
4346201 you cant drop that many balls and expect to move the ball consistently
4346202 when we sustain drives and move the ball down field we have to come out with touchdowns thats the most important thing in this game
4346203 they really didnt come out to put pressure at all which one can understand
4346204 but i think one should give credit to their level of play they have made germany suffer they made korea suffer and they have made spain suffer
4346205 with all the corners we should have put a margin on the board
4346206 we make ourselves suffer because of that we are too forgiving in the circle without a doubt
4346207 heroin addicts make up only 3 percent of our patients
4346208 the vast majority of our patients are hooked on prescription pain pills painkillers are the new heroin the days of the street corner drug dealer are over you can pick up the phone make a call and have pills delivered like ordering a pizza
4346209 ive seen methadone and the support that goes with it give them a chance to rejoin society
4346210 every precaution is taken to make sure our patients are not misusing the methadone
4346211 that is where methadone on the street is coming from not from methadone clinics
4346212 if you can hustle 80 a day to pay for oxy you can afford 10 a day for methadone
4346213 normal people that hurt their back or got injured and were prescribed pain medication by a doctor

4346216 we will go out to any organization and make a presentation about how methadone helps addicts
4346217 the main thing we do is treat our patients with respect and dignity

4346222 its just a terrible thing to see one of your old friends pass away
4346223 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to get support in
4346224 we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow
4346225 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beautiful trips with him
4346226 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours
4346227 but after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4346228 she clark made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo
4346229 we dont really know what the real cause of death is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4346230 it takes her clark about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4346231 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4346232 we wonder if this means mcmahon will have to appear on the next season of the apprentice

4346239 footnoting to a discredited blog item does not constitute careful scholarship and the bulk of mr corsis book has nothing to do with issues he gets facts wrong he makes offensive statements
4346240 i dont think there has been enough scrutiny until now
4346241 there are too many places for people to get information
4346242 i dont think newspapers can be the gatekeepers anymore to say this is wrong and we will ignore it now we have to say this is wrong and here is why
4346243 we have printed the facts and some of those facts have undermined kerrys opponents
4346244 we are not judging the credibility of kerry or the swift boat veterans we just print the facts
4346245 the washington post should not even be running such a story in the first place len downie and the papers other editors would undoubtedly argue that the story represents the posts tenacity for getting to the truth without fear or favor but what the story actually proves is that a bunch of liars who have in the past contradicted their own current statements can if their lies are outrageous enough and if they have enough money control the media agenda and get even the most respected media outlets in the country to focus on picayune truths while missing the larger story

4346271 i was shocked about the whole thing when i heard about it and its really sad when some little stupid fling that he did puts him in such a tough situation
4346272 this is something i never even thought id ever hear about paul but i really feel bad for him that this one bad decision gets blown up so much i dont think thats justified
4346273 i think he is more worried about his future in wrestling than anything else and this is the last thing he wanted to deal with as his senior year is coming up
4346274 the last thing he wanted to do was leave nebraska paul is one of the hardest working athletes i know and is a great student too nothing is going to keep him from going after his goal of winning another ncaa championship

4346291 i feel very good i expended very little energy so i think i have a lot to give in the final
4346292 one doesnt comment on the quality of a song only if he knows to sing
4346293 oh my gosh i cant believe this injustice how can this be weve got to do something about that
4346294 go to china live there for 6 months dont be a shut in and close your mind open your mind and really experience the culture and then come back and tell me you still hate it
4346295 best damn decision i made in my life to come here mate lots of aussies
4346296 are we really a stubborn arrogant nation that doesnt want to understand and blocks out everything we dont believe in or is that just a misconception
4346297 when we have too much security you blame us for oppressing people when we dont have enough security you blame us for being a dangerous place to be what do you want from us
4346298 dont criticize what you dont understand son you never walked in that mans shoes

4346302 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4346303 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4346304 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4346305 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4346306 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4346307 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4346308 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4346309 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4346310 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4346311 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4346312 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4346313 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4346314 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4346315 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4346316 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4346317 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4346318 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4346319 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4346320 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4346321 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4346322 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4346323 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4346324 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4346325 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4346326 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4346327 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4346328 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4346329 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4346330 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4346331 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4346332 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4346333 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4346334 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4346335 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4346336 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4346337 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4346338 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4346339 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4346340 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4346341 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4346342 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4346343 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4346344 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4346345 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4346346 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4346347 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4346348 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4346349 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4346350 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4346351 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4346352 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4346353 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4346354 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4346355 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4346356 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4346357 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4346358 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4346359 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4346360 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4346361 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4346362 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4346363 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4346364 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4346365 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4346376 another issues involves the growing gap in the information society or the problem of digital divide due to enormously varied degrees of technological advances government policy and knowledge and understanding of open source software among the participating economies

4346404 limited size of initial purchase price within total cost of software ownership
4346405 in particular proprietary software may not be open source but it is certainly free for the great majority of developing country users thanks to piracy
4346406 by saying proprietorial software is free for the bulk of the developing world the study is guilty of both tolerating encouraging the illegally copying of software piracy is a loaded term unfortunately accepted by academia too and missing the essence of what free software is all about offering the freedom to be used copied studied modified and redistributed we are not fighting just for the right to remain pirates
4346407 academics should make sure that they look at all factors when they write something like this

4346410 there is no religious war here but i think the staunch defenders of proprietary code get stuck on analyzing the software this isnt the important part one needs to analyze the innovation and use of software that i believe is where the real ict impact lies

4346413 as an african business and as an african software development business i still dont get it theres so much enthusiasm for foss theres so much conference mind share spent on this topic and yet i dont see an illuminating discussion about the opportunities for risk reward for people like us
4346414 you can read this message in two ways either that foss will never deliver or that the foss community needs to rethink its strategies or of course if youve devoted months or years to foss and dont like the message youll try to denigrate the writer deny the data and so forth
4346415 yes my organization chasquinet foundation works with microsoft and yes it is the same organization that produced and published the open source tollbox for telecenters in latin america 19 and yes we have as a policy in our organization that people should have a right to choose what counts for us here at the grassroots are real ict tools for development be they open source or otherwise what counts is if they make a real positive impact in improving peoples lives

4346420 were going to have basic primary care for the citizens of west columbia when the clinic is opened
4346421 a lot of people are having trouble understanding what urgent care is they seem to associate that with emergency care and what urgent care actually is is basically the same services you receive at your doctor
4346422 this brazosport regional health system deal is really the first thing of this nature that our edc has done and its basically a new edc as well
4346423 this was a big endeavor and was a kind of think out of the box type situation
4346424 at this point probably were going to have to consider something similar like we do for liquor licenses and that type of nature where you designate so many feet from a school or church

4346500 meneer hier in aardenburg zijn we zo niet u ziet toch ook dat het druk is als we dan moeten wachten dan wachten we gewoon dan klagen we niet zo zitten we hier in deze streek niet in elkaar maar u bent zon hollander en jullie zijn zo gejaagd altijd gestresst alles moet maar hup snel en vooruit en dan gelijk een grote mond opzetten maar hier in aardenburg gaat dat gemoedelijk als het wat langer duurt dan geven we daar niet om dat accepteren we daar doen we niet moeilijk over u mag hier de toerist komen uithangen maar u moet zich wel een beetje aan onze leefstijl aanpassen klagen moet u maar thuis in holland doen
4346501 ik ga terug naor uus nao de voorstraote want dao weun ik tien jaor
4346502 je kunt zo lekker ontspannen en helder nadenken en daarom blow ik eigenlijk liever dan dat ik drink
4346503 wat doen al die mensen s morgens vroeg al in sluis
4346504 i really like j r hes athletic skilled a great in between game
4346505 he has a chance to fight for minutes right away because of his defense
4346506 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4346507 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4346508 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4346509 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4346510 so far the biggest trade was for clyde drexler because we won a championship
4346511 tracy mcgrady was pretty big too i think this guy ron really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4346512 im really trying to hold my excitement down but i mean we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far he adds another element to the team once you see him on the floor with the great players we have it really makes us very hard to beat
4346513 in this league a lot of guys are different when they get older and they mature
4346514 hes a different person now i think than he was years ago he cares about his on court performance and how his team is going to do more than he ever has in his life
4346515 this offseason one of our goals was to add a significant player
4346516 we feel we were able to do that and more with ron artest the former all star a player who plays both ends of the floor at a significant level someone who plays multiple positions to give coach rick adelman the options of the players he needs to lead us to the championship
4346517 when adelman had me on the court in sacramento he used me at every single position
4346518 sometimes he would play me at the two when there was a dominant two such as a kobe bryant or a dwyane wade or steve nash was killing us one time in phoenix he put me at the one he put me at the five
4346519 i work on my game every summer so i get better i dont make a big jump at one specific thing but i make a good enough leap at everything to be able to play every position ill be ready thats how i play my game
4346520 whatever adelman needs me to do whether thats come off the bench sixth seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4346521 obviously at some point were going to sit down with daryl i look forward to working with the rockets
4346522 these issues are more than likely to be deliberated on during the pacific island forum pif leaders summit in
4346523 i again informed mr sharma that png has set up the climate change office and we have had extensive collaborations with the global community on this topical issue png is therefore better placed to share our concerns and experiences on climate change with our other pif colleagues
4346524 such an office will greatly assist sis representatives in these two cities to have access to administration as well as technical expertise of the commonwealth
4346525 i stand on the first tee and i just feel comfortable
4346526 everybody has golf courses where you just look down there and you cant see anything the comfort zone is the most important thing
4346527 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4346528 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4346529 el col n casi cerrado me produce una profunda tristeza all empec en el coro de ni os y tuve la fortuna de llegar al cargo de director art stico es doloroso ver mi segundo hogar en ese estado esperemos que se reabra lo antes posible pero mientras tanto en vez de lamentarnos y echar culpas debemos ayudar para su pronta reapertura
4346530 hace a os v la pel cula que cocteau realiz de su obra y qued maravillado desde ese momento me propuse hacer un drama l rico con ese argumento pero s lo muchos a os despu s pude finalmente realizarlo

4346532 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4346533 i sometimes think that being widowed is gods way of telling you to come off the pill
4346534 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
4346535 the pill to a great degree made possible the hetero sexual revolution yet those who developed oral contraceptives did not intend to promote what the majority of americans at the time called promiscuity
4346536 the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact
4346537 in destroying the power of giving life through contraception a husband or wife is doing something to self this destroys the gift of love in him or her
4346538 macri ha enviado a la legislatura un proyecto de ley para convertir el col n en un ente aut rquico
4346539 el objetivo del gobierno es convertir al teatro en una sala de alquiler donde se realicen negocios privados en detrimento de sus trabajadores y de su producci n propia

4346552 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful

4346557 so long as i am acting from duty and conviction i am indifferent to taunts and jeers i think they will probably do me more good than harm
4346558 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4346559 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4346560 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4346561 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
4346562 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me
4346563 if im so fine can you get off my fineness then
4346564 you should stop thinking that everything goes in your favor reina
4346565 they just wanted some mud holes to play in but i was always growling at them for spinning around the fields
4346566 theres just something exciting about the four wheel drives in the mud
4346567 its a sport for adrenaline junkies its a high without the alcohol and the drugs
4346568 your statements and appearances in the media have been instruments in creating fear anxiety and segregation in a community where citizens should be living in peace and harmony with each other
4346569 the hispanic community will continue to have a voice in the carcieri administration
4346570 we believe this is causing a stigma around the immigrant population and we dont want to be part of it
4346571 we all basically felt the same feeling but we wanted to continue working because we feel like our people need representation
4346572 we certainly had more moisture than required but we should have had sun too it would have improved the crop a bit
4346573 we got into it 20 years ago stephen and i and kept expanding since then
4346574 theres a lot of work to them but nothing comes easy
4346575 what this case is about is an unconstitutional gag order a prior restraint on my clients ability to speak about a matter of great public interest
4346576 they always intended to withhold the details of their research at the conference
4346577 show how we reverse engineered the data on magstripe card
4346578 they never intended that they were going to give people the tools or the information to do that
4346579 must encourage more students to take advanced placement courses so they are better prepared for postsecondary education and training
4346580 words were exchanged between the two groups and a fight ensued between the two groups
4346581 we were unable to charge other people because we were unable to get positive identifications from the victims in a lineup
4346582 theres still one more person we believe was involved that were looking for
4346583 principals with one copy machine in their building are very frustrated
4346584 i dont know how the little kids carry those backpacks
4346585 the idea of being more paperless has escaped us in education
4346586 this is really the first green bank that weve done
4346587 if nothing else its jobs and its industry for the village
4346588 heres a step in the right direction hopefully other businesses will catch on to this as well

4346593 if you watch this movie we want you to think about what youre laughing at its not funny
4346594 we are viewing this as the educational opportunity that it is
4346595 since his speech i havent used the word as much
4346596 a few people have said to me dont use that word
4346597 a lot of it is ignorance more than malice they dont know how much it hurts people with intellectual disabilities
4346598 theres no recognition that its very harmful to a significant amount of the population as many as 3 percent of the population has some type of intellectual disability
4346599 calling something a satire is not a get out of jail free card
4346600 we are asking vermonters not to spend their hard earned dollars on this film because of its deplorable and demeaning view of a person with intellectual disabilities
4346601 laughing at this movie is laughing at us laughing at this movie is laughing at us
4346602 almost any comedy someone will find something offensive about i believe
4346603 nothing in comedy is done with any seriousness im going to go see it
4346604 satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
4346605 it would create some real delays for three or four elementary schools
4346606 when i went to brazil i taught the people to garden
4346607 they had plenty of meat and rice and dairy products but no vegetables
4346608 i am not going to give up the dream of both koreas living well together
4346609 which is the source of distrust and conflict has to be eliminated completely
4346610 i have expectations that north korea will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4346611 opening the age of the pacific and the age of eurasia simultaneously a unified korea will leap toward the center of the global community
4346612 riches i heed not nor mans empty praise thou mine inheritance now and always thou and thou only first in my heart high king of heaven my treasure thou art
4346613 this is really a campaign within a campaign with the help of volunteers plastering the area with signs getting the word out this has all the elements of a campaign
4346614 the goal is to get as many people registered as possible by september and to instill in them that they absolutely should vote
4346615 we catch them wherever they are in their everyday lives
4346616 im using my magic as a catalyst to get people to vote to show them its their right their privilege their responsibility
4346617 i remember when i was 8 years old standing on the corner of union street holding up a campaign sign it was a grassroots thing much like this
4346618 we allow the refugees to stay in any unused building they can find
4346619 you can blame whomever you want but in the 21st century this is completely unacceptable
4346620 i didnt want to wait i dropped everything and ran
4346621 people who went north either went to their relatives or refugee camps
4346622 people who were left homeless and are still in south ossetia are living with their relatives or neighbors
4346623 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4346624 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4346625 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4346626 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4346627 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4346628 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4346629 kelirulah kita apabila berpendapat bahwa hanya ada satu cara saja dalam berhukum di dunia ini bangsa bangsa di dunia ini memilih caranya sendiri untuk berhukum kendati sama sama menyebut diri sebagai negara hukum tetapi kita tidak akan menemukan cara yang seragam dalam berhukum itu
4346630 this new van will allow the town to continue to enhance services and programs offered to fairhaven seniors
4346631 transportation is one of the most important services the town provides for our seniors
4346632 adding a new van will ensure that the coa continues to provide seniors with safe and reliable transportation to and from the coa doctor appointments bank library or pharmacy needs and the grocery store
4346633 we cannot say that these massachusetts towns are not worth investing in
4346634 every single one of you makes up part of a successful couple of past years and the future
4346635 we may not always see eye to eye but your cause is my cause
4346636 i understand theres citizens upset so we can just have a time to talk about it
4346637 im bringing up the issue of the process of going through the naming with no public input
4346638 go to the meeting on the 25th see what happens and then well go from there
4346639 i can understand why people would be how about this person
4346640 this was a suggestion that i had made so there could be many other suggestions and im open to all that i dont have a private agenda im here for the town of fairhaven
4346641 im somewhat concerned that now youve flipped on some of those maverick positions
4346642 when you came out and stated that you thought barack obama would rather lose a war to win an election i heard that as you calling him a traitor because thats what a member of the u s senate who would feel that way actually would be
4346643 do you think barack obama is a traitor do you still believe that he really would rather lose a war in order to lose an election if you do what makes you say that
4346644 what areas do you think i have changed my position
4346645 no no you said that i flip flopped on a number of issues id like to hear where that is
4346646 changed somewhat in an effort to appeal to your base
4346647 i believe in a very large republican party we have to be inclusive
4346648 ill continue a life that i hope is characterized by both redemption which i badly need and reconciliation
4346649 and sen obama said that the surge wouldnt work that it would fail he voted to cut off funding for the men and women serving in iraq he refuses to acknowledge that the surge is succeeding he announced after not being there for 900 days he announced his policy on iraq before left
4346650 i think hes wrong and i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party thats my answer to you
4346651 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money
4346652 you have to appeal to the cowboy in everyone and sell to them
4346653 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts
4346654 i never wanted to be the richest man in the cemetery
4346655 youll see a campaign that is better at staying on message
4346656 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4346657 but what were learning is that once you become the nominee every word is seized upon
4346658 his day is more structured focused on getting the message out
4346659 what you have to realize is that this is a marathon
4346660 i think john would do a town hall meeting that would last for days
4346661 john dont wear yourself out make sure your message resonates visually
4346662 weve come a long way from the new orleans puke green background to a much crisper campaign
4346663 quite honestly its whatever anybody wants to make they bring it to us and we will find a class for it
4346664 there are some that like to see how they measure up against someone else and then there are others that do it just because they enjoy doing it
4346665 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4346666 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4346667 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4346668 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent
4346669 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation as weekly earnings adjusted for inflation lies below the level they reached in august 1998
4346670 if this administration were competing in the bad economic policy olympics theyd receive four gold medals today
4346671 it will take some time for the economy to turn around
4346672 obamanomics is lavish government spending that must be paid for by new tax increases on a struggling economy
4346673 its every part of the housing market thats getting whacked right now
4346674 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4346675 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4346676 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4346677 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4346678 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4346679 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4346680 all this does it says we swept the families away we pretend that gadhafi never blew up an american plane
4346681 the agreement provides some justice and closure for the victims of libyan terrorism and their families
4346682 but it is small consolation and will not bring back the lives that have been lost nor undo the suffering endured by survivors
4346683 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4346684 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4346685 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4346686 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4346687 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4346688 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4346689 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work
4346690 sometimes in spite of himself he finds himself involved in policy matters by superiors who wish to take advantage of his name
4346691 what we tried to do this year was make it the biggest yet
4346692 i dont know what the reasoning was but they past organizers kind of cut the fire trucks out of the parade so this year we are trying to get them back in because the kids like them its to let them be involved and show that they are a part of the community
4346693 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4346694 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4346695 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4346696 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4346697 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4346698 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4346699 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the us dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro
4346700 since then the greenback has improved by 6 9 percent
4346701 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4346702 fewer highway deaths is always the silver lining of a down economy
4346703 the report which specifically addressed speculation appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4346704 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven in oil prices
4346705 we are greatly disturbed that although cftc staff obviously knew that underlying data used to prepare the interim report was seriously flawed the interim report was nonetheless publicly released
4346706 why it was released after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4346707 in light of the recent increases in energy prices and the resulting concerns of the public and policy makers
4346708 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4346709 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4346710 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4346711 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4346712 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4346713 attempts were made but mr bevins has the right not to speak he was interviewed the day of the crash i wouldnt want to get further into the details
4346714 they break into the clubhouse they either trash the place or steal whats in there
4346715 were a volunteer group and we all work hard down there and put a lot of time into the place
4346716 its frustrating to go down and see these people with no respect for anything or anybody just go in and destroy stuff it can make you mad
4346717 its the morons on their four wheelers and trucks doing all this damage
4346718 thats part of the problem theres not people there all the time
4346719 i know theres security systems but we just dont have that kind of money
4346720 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4346721 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4346722 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4346723 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4346724 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4346725 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4346726 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4346727 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4346728 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4346729 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe

4346738 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4346739 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies

4346741 most mothers here are tortured because they dont know what happened
4346742 we knew the kids were getting better when they started misbehaving
4346743 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4346744 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4346745 ultimately al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists

4346752 its great when you get your sinker guy and he does that for you
4346753 you take away his second and third inning where his pitch count ran up and he would have been a lot more efficient

4346755 you and i sitting down for a talk over coffee

4346757 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multi cultural country in spain
4346758 mooi toch dat de corner van taeke zo lekker loopt
4346759 ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de velddoelpunten ook weer gaan vallen daar komt vaak een beetje geluk bij kijken later in het toernooi is ook goed
4346760 door alle rompslomp heb ik de laatste weken mijn hoofd niet echt meer bij fietsen ik denk dat het beter is dat ik me richt op volgend seizoen waar ik sterker dan ooit wil terugkomen
4346761 ik heb jaren met plezier bij deze ploeg gereden maar het is duidelijk dat het de laatste weken niet meer boterde meer wil ik er niet over zeggen omdat de afspraak is gemaakt dat we ons onthouden van commentaar voor mij is het nu belangrijk om zo snel mogelijk een goede andere ploeg te vinden
4346762 may 20 2005 chose to behead the antigua and barbuda police force by sending home 21 senior officers he can never adequately explain the end result has been a desultory performance by the police leaders of his choice and an escalation in crime brought on by the resulting loss of leadership
4346763 het is geen excuus voor de slechte race van marleen maar de startprocedure moet wel op een normale manier verlopen
4346764 het publiek had eerst tot stilte gemaand moeten worden maar dat gebeurde niet en daarna wachtte hij veel te lang
4346765 ze heeft een heel slechte race gezwommen zulke fouten mag je in een olympische finale niet maken
4346766 ze bewoog zelfs even ze had daar zelfs gediskwalificeerd voor kunnen worden dat gebeurde gelukkig niet het was geen fijn begin maar die start kun je niet als excuus aanvoeren ze had zich daarna aan het raceplan moeten houden maar nu blies ze zichzelf met een soort kamikazeactie op ik ben daarom ook wel een beetje boos op een gegeven moment denk je ze weet het wel
4346767 the real deal guy and thats no typo on my part it really does only come with the one quotation mark
4346768 im just asking them to sit and watch because youre going to eat your words
4346769 life is dull life is full of pain the trick is to enjoy life accepting it has no meaning whatsoever
4346770 full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness and its all over much too quickly
4346771 i know this in no way makes up for all of the pain and suffering i gave you but i am so so sorry
4346772 i am not strong enough to ask for forgiveness because i dont know if i am worthy i realize what ive done to you and the pain ive given
4346773 please lord forgive me i have done some terrible things
4346774 i know i have affected them for so long to these families i ask forgiveness
4346775 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey

4346786 mommy loves you how sweet is that i swear i tear up every time i read it i m tearing up right now too precious and something i think i will always remember and try to do
4346787 i think because of the way i handled myself on the field when i was playing they asked me if i wanted to come back as a coach
4346788 i did the right thing off the field and i played the game the way it should be played i think thats why they called me before that i didnt even consider getting into coaching
4346789 i knew how to play the game right and i was smart
4346790 i feel like i got the most out of my ability and i had some great coaches i feel like i could have played in the big leagues defensively with my arm and because of that i have a lot of knowledge to share with these guys
4346791 i had a really good player career it was an enjoyable seven years
4346792 i put my blood sweat and tears into getting to the big leagues but it just didnt happen i feel like if i looked myself in the mirror now i know that i gave it everything i had considering that i thought it was time to move on now im looking forward to making it to the big leagues one day as a coach i know this is a learning experience but i feel like ive gotten off to a good start

4346797 we want every section of our society to get access to education
4346798 i want to see a modern india imbued by a scientific temper where the benefits of modern knowledge flow to all sections of society
4346799 i felt a little sluggish but my body has woken up now
4346800 every time i breathe it hurts but its a case of mind over matter
4346801 we do this because soldiers like wilson deserve to be honored
4346802 not only so but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved but hope that is seen is no hope at all who hopes for what he already has but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently
4346803 i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and his incomparably great power for us who believe that power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms far above all rule and authority power and dominion and every title that can be given not only in the present age but also in the one to come

4346822 i am glad the cereal bank was there for me and my family when we needed it the most
4346823 of particular concern is the emergence of what i call the new face of hunger hunger characterized by markets full of food with scores of people simply unable to afford it
4346824 by surveying several elderly people we were able to learn that at that time even though tuition was only 2 yuan which these days is only enough to buy a meal then it was very hard to come by it is said this money was subsidized by the country they had to pay for cafeteria meals which altogether came to 10 yuan how much hard work around the clock would this require normally at first light they would get out of bed and go to school on foot as soon as they got to school they would grab a book and start to read at nine they would eat breakfast and normally would study math in the morning
4346825 when my dad got so sick my mom sold all the cows goats and chicken to get medicine but the situation was not getting better then my uncle suggested that we sell all the land which we did we live in a hut with my two sisters when it rains we stand in the corner and wait for the morning to go to our school nyaka without nyaka i would be working for food everyday

4346833 this is a judge and we dont know how often this happens who simply refused to perform her function in a responsible way
4346834 it amazes me that mr bentley is quick to jump to the conclusion that there is a need for a legislative change when in fact what we may have here is simply a judge who wasnt up to the job and wasnt doing her job
4346835 its unbelievable that somebody could have had a lengthy criminal record and that no one asked
4346836 the judge didnt know and yet that judge was then put in a position where she made a decision without having that information in front of her its unbelievable

4346871 este hecho deja claro que aqu nadie puede saltarse las cosas a la torera ni la empresa del alcalde ni una concejala del equipo de gobierno
4346872 el retraso que ha sufrido la resoluci n se debe a que ni yo como instructor del documento y vicepresidente de la gerencia ni el alcalde por razones obvias pod amos firmarlo y por tanto hemos tenido que esperar a que hubiera un alcalde en funciones
4346873 tal y como era nuestra intenci n y la del alcalde hemos dado la oficialidad obligada a un expediente que ha sido tratado de la forma m s escrupulosa

4346923 it would be irresponsible to say that the economic climate is not having an impact i dont think its going to slow down what were doing
4346924 we have to modify to some extent those things that were going to initiate at first it will not ultimately impact what we do but we have to be realistic to say that as opposed to spending all of the money upfront that well probably break this up

4346947 i just drew a version of me as a kid and started thinking what i could do with that and then he ended up doing stand up to the audience
4346948 the one that said i should be written out of the show and it should be about little howard
4346949 ironically the next show i wrote was about that scenario and that started the process of me being slowly written out that got nominated for the perrier mainly because i called kate copstick a naughty word in it
4346950 that show is about little howard finding out that i had a real baby and becoming very jealous of the fact that he has a nose and ears and howard doesnt that leads me to tell him about the magic pencil of life and death which created him the pencil draws cartoon characters and they come to life but the eraser on the other end destroys them
4346951 ive tried to write about myself and my life but my lifes quite tedious im just a white middle class person from the home counties
4346952 theres nothing really that funny theres not a lot of legitimate complaining a middle class white person in their early thirties can do and certainly not when theyre in their early twenties
4346953 none of my family are that funny nothing that crazy ever happens to them and i have to make it all up
4346954 i really wish that i had some angst well i dont really but wish i had a family that constantly gets into japes and scrapes but i dont
4346955 theyre very sensible my mum and dad are retired sometimes things go missing from church but stand up audiences arent that interested in that
4346956 that partly came from starting off at university and not knowing anything about life thats why a lot of comedians in their twenties are usually quite surreal theyve got nothing else to talk about ive been trying to write that show about my life but the best bits that came out of it were the flights of fancy the surreal ness the impressions of a tyrannosaurus rex
4346957 i am trying to work in a steptoe and son style relationship where one is trying to destroy the others life
4346958 whats been successful so far about the live show because weve been touring this live show since last edinburgh is that the adults seem to really enjoy it as well so its nice to use my stand up background to entertain everyone
4346959 the aim is to keep it family friendly but you can still get filthy jokes through
4346960 we did the royal variety and got lots of filth but without swearing and stuff its okay as long as you do it in a subtle way that any children watching wont understand
4346961 negotiation to me is something like a nightclub not something i tend to enter into
4346962 every day im with you i keep catching my breath
4346963 the more that i researched crane the more i realised that he was actually a very clued up socialist
4346964 this was an important thing to try to reintegrate back into our understanding of crane as an artist
4346965 the exhibition is seeing crane through the prism of manchester he saw it as a city that seemed to embody the dangers of industrial capitalism but also one with a strong sense of civic identity and pride
4346966 it allowed crane to see both sides seeing the publics interest in establishing museums and schools of art it gave him hope of popular resistance
4346967 the beauty of nature opposed what crane would have seen as the degradation of industry
4346968 his images have echoes of the garden of eden a socialist utopia where everyone is equal
4346969 in a sense thats why cranes reputation is less well remembered he was popular up to the 1930s when a soviet inspired marxism took over putting an end to that utopian vision
4346970 you can make jokes driving poppy but you will crash and you will die
4346971 this is like listening to a lost kate bush album its a perfect mix of pop and indie
4346972 den nya tn n var ocks ett bra k p
4346973 that means working solutions for the b2b market and work on all legal constraints a company may have while distributing software
4346974 first we define the products and the business model and then we develop and release products under the appropriate license so for the codecs some of them have to be proprietary such as h 264 and windows media and others can be open sourced theora and dirac
4346975 provide a legal way for free software zealots to convert their mp3 content to free formats
4346976 fluendo has worked hard to be able to convince the patent holders to give the rights to distribute the codecs for an entire operating system legally it was one of the challenges to be able to make legal multimedia on open source solutions a reality
4346977 we have regular discussions with the community about our solutions
4346978 fluendo is a company composed by people involved in the community and we always go hand in hand with the community it is normal that we dont always agree all together the patent situation in the multimedia field is very diffciult to understand and we have to satisify as many customers as we can whether they be end users from the community or big corporations
4346979 globally fluendo is welcome and considered as an open source friendly company
4346980 the majority of the 50 people in our company are developers full involved in the open source community
4346981 the community has always recognized that fluendo as very supportive even if selling non open source software
4346982 to help linux users to understand why some plugins are missing in their distribution and then we wanted to help them download solutions in the simplest way so codeina automatically pops up when you try to read a file and dont have a good codec then you can choose the solution you want
4346983 in addition to the philosophy which is present in our daily work as a company the top management has always believed that there are ways to conduct business based upon free software
4346984 this is the major link between fluendo and the open source community we are just part of it and we want to keep on being part of it we believe that open source solutions have a great future and we want to be be one of the players in this future
4346985 gnu linux remains weak in its support for proprietary audio and video codecs
4346986 its time for programmers to realize that writing a license and choosing one is best left for lawyers because what you write and what you choose can impact the entire community in ways you dont even understand in ways that can undermine and even destroy it
4346987 i have a really energetic role in high school musical so i have to eat plenty of carbs during the day
4346988 the kids just go crazy i think its amazing that so many children are getting their first taste of theatre because of this show
4346989 the movie has been such a phenomenon i got to speak to the guy who created it and even he cant believe how big it has become and that its now on the stage as well he created it just as a straight to tv film
4346990 the thing about sharpay is that shes the girl everyone loves to hate because of the way she dresses girls do look up to her the reaction after the show has always been great fans queue up to meet all of us at stage door after the show they cant wait to meet us and have photos taken and a little chat

4347028 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package
4347029 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration
4347030 there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects
4347031 its cool obama ill get the phone you go back to your luxury vacation

4347035 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4347036 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4347037 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4347038 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4347039 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4347040 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays

4347061 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4347062 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4347063 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4347064 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted

4347070 it starts out in a familiar vein one more attempt to define the nature of someones exquisite love

4347181 subject to a positive feasibility study in september we continue to anticipate significantly expanding production by developing already identified new production centres at the guitarra mine in the next few years
4347182 our optimism with regard to the proposed expansion is based in part on the significant increase in estimated reserves and resources at la guitarra announced in june
4347183 i think that quite clearly qantas themselves regret any disruption that occurs but it is important also to put this in perspective
4347184 australia has a second to none safety system and it is certainly in australias national interest for qantas to not be talked down
4347185 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same

4347198 we like to hear what pastors have to say its a christian movie based on an icon who has done amazing things just by having faith in god
4347199 the movie shows we pastors are real people and we do have a love story to tell but the main love story is that jesus loves us and has a plan for us

4347227 do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen

4347229 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases

4347232 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4347233 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4347234 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4347235 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4347236 the textile footwear clothing is the second largest industry in fiji employing some 8000 locals and most of them are women so the decline of the industry will severely affect the middle and low income earners who largely depend on the garment industry for their livelihood the declining exports will contribute to a narrowing of the export base of fiji
4347237 the current initiative by the government is to develop a sense of partnership with the private sector through joint ventures is a clear indication of their seriousness in pursuing the development of the industry
4347238 further government will continue lobbying for trade concessions and more favourable rules of origin from australian and the us government however it must also be realized that trade concessions are being phased out due to wto compatible requirement industry players must also take responsibility for upgrading their production efficiency so that they are able to compete internationally

4347250 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

4347254 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4347255 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4347256 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4347257 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4347258 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4347259 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4347260 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4347261 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4347262 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4347263 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4347271 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4347272 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4347273 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4347274 for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and the cease fire agreement to be honored
4347275 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4347300 floridas process isnt as clean as it once was gov jeb bush persuaded the legislature to shift the rules for appointing nominating commissions when bush took office each commission there is one for the supreme court one for each appellate court and one for each judicial circuit had nine members three appointed by the governor three by the florida bar and three chosen by the first six members of the commission in 2001 the legislature changed the rules giving the governor the ability to appoint all nine members of each nominating commission the state bars role has been reduced to a purely advisory one in effect the legislature was granting the governor power to stack the courts
4347301 since 1991 218 people have been exonerated through dna testing and in more than three quarters of the cases mistaken eyewitness identifications were crucial in the wrongful convictions according to the innocence project a legal group that has sought genetic testing and led the charge to free innocent inmates of those nearly half roughly seven dozen involved a person of one race wrongly identifying someone of a different color

4347305 one of his first moves was to cut the time it took for clients to get legal representation from six weeks after arrest to 48 hours he also stopped his attorneys from advising criminal defendants to plead guilty at arraignment before having meaningful contact with their clients in recent years he has also stood up against what he considered misleading police line up procedures finkelstein has rocked the boat even when it meant offending the broward judiciary in 2005 he issued a scathing letter to judges claiming that defendants who could afford to hire a private attorney got better treatment at the courthouse

4347308 i dont believe in taking money out of something earning interest and just putting a bulk of money into an account
4347309 i dont feel it is necessary in this case to show someone that i have a war chest
4347310 frankly one of the sacrifices i made when i decided to commit myself to public service is that i would know i would never make big money
4347311 maybe some people are going for the raise most people who are really running for the position of judge think its a position that if done properly could accomplish a lot
4347312 its a reality that when youre running against an incumbent that an incumbent has more money than you
4347313 i do have a large number of people volunteering for me that will offset dijols advantage in money
4347314 im not a wealthy individual im not in the position to buy myself a seat
4347315 we want to give parents and the community a broader view of schools and their performance
4347316 at some point if a principal and a school do not meet their performance index there has to be some kind of intervention
4347317 its got to be worth giving kids like me our dreams please dont take that chance away
4347318 no final decisions have been made about what will be done or who will be in those positions

4347320 this is a very serious area of our childrens education
4347321 we have to see what she rice has to bring
4347322 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4347323 georgia is a member of the united nations as such it has internationally recognized borders therefore the territorial integrity of georgia within those borders is not an issue
4347324 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions
4347325 so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4347326 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process
4347327 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4347328 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4347329 its hard to image that more than 120 000 children in colorado suffer from hunger
4347330 the funds raised from this years event will support our local efforts to end childhood hunger and supply low income families with the foods they need to lead healthy active lives
4347331 definitely private sector pays have increased and this is little closer but what we are looking at is not a huge salary but a comfortable life
4347332 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use technologies opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialisation of our country
4347333 it the agreement will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4347334 many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered
4347335 the firing of rockets did take place this morning and it is a major incident but since the rockets were targeted at bsf positions the army is yet to ascertain the details of the incident
4347336 there were a couple of rounds of mortar fire by pakistani troops at our positions in mandi of poonch sector
4347337 they were ambushed and murdered at 10 30 in the morning by numerous armed gunmen and it was very very fast
4347338 they were absolutely committed passionate caring and highly effective workers and they were purely on a humanitarian mission

4347343 after i got sacked by the saints in 2000 i definitely didnt think i would go on and play 156 games for the pies its been a dream come true
4347344 i still love playing and i still love competing and it makes it that little bit more exciting when you are enjoying wins with young fellas like chris dawes and johnny mccarthy like i did last week
4347345 as long as those young kids keep coming through and the body holds up ill continue to have a crack
4347346 i played on james hird they essendon were the previous years premiers 1993 and it was out at waverley in round three we got up by 19 points it was a massive win we had about five first gamers for the club that day and all my family and friends were there
4347347 i think i probably have become that little bit more professional coming over to collingwood it probably took me a good four years until you realise how hard you had to work to be a good consistent afl footballer i learned from my mistakes over the previous seven years
4347348 i really thought when i got to the pies i would give myself the opportunity to play good consistent footy
4347349 they were quite unsuccessful in that period in the 1990s they were a little bit of a myth i suppose they used to pump themselves up through the press and you thought they were an arrogant club
4347350 once i was involved with the organisation and understand the history behind it and the legends that played for the football club over a long period of time all of the grand finals i have played in with the heart breaking losses with building a famous football club it was great to be a part of it
4347351 i still love playing and i still love competing and it makes it that little bit more exciting when you are enjoying wins with young fellas like chris dawes and johnny mccarthy like i did last week
4347352 as long as those young kids keep coming through and the body holds up ill continue to have a crack
4347353 i suspect it is going to be a similar game to the one we played on the weekend logic says we need to win its going to be a close encounter
4347354 it feels good its very exciting i have enjoyed my time here so far and no reason i wont have another great two years medhurst said
4347355 i started pretty slow early at collingwood with a couple of injury setbacks and homesickness but i think i have built a bit of momentum going forward and the club has as well
4347356 i am starting to play some really good footy together and i have really enjoyed my time
4347357 three games plus hopefully finals coming up one a game should get me there it would be good to beat it by one or two
4347358 obviously their fremantle struggling a little bit at the moment and were looking like a good chance to play finals again so i am pretty happy where i am within the club and where the club is heading
4347359 im not going to play the one million questions that i cant answer because my answers are never good enough for you game
4347360 wrong dead wrong but thanks for actually reading what i wrote i mean did you actually read it b c it was nothing about that it has absolutely nothing to do with answers being good enough its not a game either games are meant for fun this isnt fun i would just like an answer i mean there has to be something that you didnt like about me or wish would have changed otherwise you would not have said it simple as that you made a huge deal about that and like i said the only thing i could come up with is you didnt like how i still gave a fuck about you because believe it or not that is a huge source of all our problems you realize that right see you you dont care what i say or do its all the same to you youve been successful in your emotional separation me i could never make that clean break as well as you can quite honestly i really do wish i could be more like you then i would not have to deal with this on a daily basis like i do now let me ask you something do you actually care about yourself or what happens to you see i bet you dont even think you will live past 40 i seriously think you dont plan on living that long but guess what some people actually do care me being one of them whether you deserve it or not whether you want me to or not i cant help it my heart is tied to your life i have empathy and love and compassion for you yes you or i mean maybe you would prefer if i didnt give a damn is that it wow you had sex with some stranger tell me all about it friend how was it what was it like to have sex with some random person how did it happen did you enjoy it i bet it was exciting wow gosh golly it must have been really crazy right

4347378 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4347379 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4347380 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u

4347383 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4347384 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional ceasefire
4347385 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
4347386 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4347387 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4347388 whats being called the russian blitz of the nation of georgia former soviet republic that split away and is now threatening to split apart from within
4347389 the powerful russian war machine is moving ever deeper into georgia and teaching all of us really a lesson about what makes russia tick
4347390 but after hundreds perhaps thousands killed and tens of thousands displaced tonight georgians are asking when will the russian bear stop
4347391 so how did this fighting start and what is it really all about
4347392 whats troubling about this war fought in a relatively unknown region is that none of the suffering here is about the enclave of ossetia this war is all about russia and the message russia is sending to the world
4347393 russia has itched to strike at southern neighbor georgias brash western oriented leader president mikheil saakashvili and saakashvili gave the kremlin an opportunity when he sent troops into the separatist region of south ossetia last week in an effort to reassert georgias sovereignty
4347394 the most urgent need is to see clearly what is taking place as the crisis deepened one could hear in washington the usual attempts to blame the victim as if georgia somehow deserved this fate because its elected government had opted for friendly relations with the west
4347395 russia as my grandmother could have told george w bush always fights dirty
4347396 russias aggression is really about the subordination of georgia a democratic market oriented u s ally
4347397 in iraq we and our iraqi allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists
4347398 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
4347399 we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4347400 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4347401 a step toward real security for poland in the future
4347402 the only things we can rely on are god and the americans
4347403 i think we have been frankly pretty restrained in this
4347404 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4347405 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4347406 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4347407 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
4347408 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4347409 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
4347410 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it
4347411 foreign policy considering our current situation and possibilities is being conducted sensibly and ever more forward thinking
4347412 but owing to the heavy burden left by his predecessors an awful awful lot in russia has yet to be lifted up from decline the overall state of peoples lives remains hard and chaotic
4347413 did not know if it was georgian russian or ossetian troops who opened fire
4347414 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4347415 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4347416 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4347417 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4347418 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4347419 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4347420 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4347421 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4347422 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4347423 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4347424 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4347425 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4347426 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4347427 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents

4347441 that would be zero nuclear weapons for iran meanwhile well out of the spotlight are more than 20 000 nuclear weapons including thousands on hair trigger alert in the hands of the united states russia china britain france israel india and pakistan but then what possible risk could they pose so while theres a lot of energy for blocking the nuclear ambitions of enemies whats fallen into virtual oblivion in the west is the goal of disarming ourselves as well
4347442 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

4347446 although based at lse the new centre will draw together leading researchers in the field from across the country including those from universities of glasgow newcastle oxford and swansea we aim to be a centre of excellence for independent high quality innovative strategic research enhancing the evidence base to inform why some areas of the uk outperform others as well as a hub for engaging national and international stakeholders for capacity development and knowledge exchange
4347447 the centre for research in spatial economics provides the university with the opportunity to further its reputation in regional economics and to work with world leading academics at other institutions
4347448 the objective of the centre is to significantly improve the evidence base on the precise nature extent causes and consequences of the uks spatial disparities and help identify the appropriate policy response to them the research for wales is particularly important as devolution has resulted in the need for wales to develop new policy initiatives rather than just implementing policies from westminster this has led to a greater need for research on the welsh economy and policy advice for the welsh assembly government
4347449 within wales the aim of the research is to expand the knowledge base by modelling and explaining regional differences in economic prosperity and to identify those groups and areas which may be falling behind it is planned that the research will identify future areas of policy development aimed at increasing prosperity throughout wales
4347450 this exciting new research centre reinforces our commitment to supporting leading edge research in areas that impact on key areas for society and policy as well as strengthening the uk research base in economics and other related disciplines this is a solid investment that will help to ensure that the research base contributes fully to the economic development and quality of life for the people of the uk and beyond
4347451 the issues to be researched by the new centre are highly relevant to wales i very much welcome this announcement and i am particularly pleased to see that swansea university is fully involved as part of the successful team it is very encouraging for the welsh higher education sector to have participation in such a ground breaking esrc investment
4347452 the new centre will study issues that are highly relevant to the future of all areas wales improving economic growth and reducing economic inactivity are key factors that must be addressed to allow wales economy to continue to grow from strength to strength

4347489 the png lng project is my governments number one priority and we are committed to completing the feed stage and beyond with the support of exxonmobil as our major partner
4347490 i am extremely pleased with the commitment of the state exxonmobil and our other partners to settle on a set of commercial and technical terms we are all comfortable with
4347491 the highest support the png lng project continues to get from exxonmobil
4347492 this includes the government elevating the stewardship of the project to the ministerial economic committee mec chaired by the treasurer serving the mec will be a project coordination team comprising national and external professionals who will be solely dedicated to the lng project
4347493 the outlook in the medium to long term three to 10 years for further growth in gas gold minerals and oil is promising as new gas and oil fields and mines come on line the proposed multibillion kina png lng project alone will bring in billions of kina directly to the treasury budget coupled with many more indirect benefits in job creation developing value adding industries and providing for transfer of technology and knowledge
4347494 the challenge for technocrats and policy makers is how effectively this wealth is to be managed to the extent that all papua new guineans including our village people both in the current and future generations can benefit
4347495 the critical issue here is whether the benefit to village people or our rural communities will be direct or indirect i am inclined to think that village people other than those in the immediate project areas would expect indirect gains by empowering them with some basic capital especially those relating to human business and infrastructure
4347496 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can invade its neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4347497 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
4347498 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4347499 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
4347500 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
4347501 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity

4347504 a man of the pacific from the pacific and for the pacific

4347511 we thrive in markets that are overdeveloped and overdeveloped markets always have people that are struggling or underperforming we dont really care because were not the chamber of commerce but the more people there are in the market the better it is for us because we take the top end of that business i would prefer that our neighbors be successful but their success is not entirely relevant to our own performance

4347522 the level of the players the coaches and training facilities are extremely high and i learned a lot while i was there when i returned to china i was a better player there is no question about it
4347523 the best thing that any young chinese footballer can do is move abroad and id urge them to do so as quickly as possible most of our young players do not have enough experience theyve never faced so much pressure before there were occasions when some of them simply gave up
4347524 im not satisfied far from it but i think we can move forward from this
4347525 we have to make a lot of improvements but we need to be given time

4347543 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms
4347544 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions
4347545 one need not overly focus on the idiosyncracies of making a perfect final sports betting art piece but instead on making foundation work solid and easy to discern

4347550 this constant harping on this floor about cutting monies from other areas under the guise of balancing the budget i say shame on you too i say shame on you because we are not doing the legislative process any good and like i say those that bite me will be bitten back

4347580 fiji is of course free to arrange any meetings with forum partners throughout its time in niue
4347581 allowing ample opportunity for discussions before the partners leave niue at 9 40pm
4347582 there is therefore no basis to any suggestion that new zealand is somehow preventing the participation of the fiji interim government delegation in either the forum or the post forum dialogue
4347583 new zealand has by granting specific exemptions to its travel ban to enable transit through auckland ensured the opportunity for the interim government to front up to leaders in niue

4347593 if you subtract their numbers it doesnt make much of a dent
4347594 although that does not excuse extremely high levels of usage
4347595 but just assumed that various things like having guests for a few weeks were causing
4347596 hopefully its a broken pipe and that will be the end of it

4347598 were watching apd do their due diligence and make the arrests for drug dealing and then were watching a revolving door
4347599 we put people on probation and told them they cant come back we sent them to the pen so they cant come back for a while
4347600 and were trying to implement these same strategies in other areas as well

4347616 when did mary risk her life when did she demonstrate that she was willing to die for god
4347617 mary sat at jesus feet and heard his word but martha was distracted
4347618 all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution
4347619 if not with a spear at least with a snear
4347620 and jesus answered and said to her martha martha you are worried and troubled about many things but one thing is needed and mary has chosen that good part which will not be taken way from her
4347621 that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to
4347622 i have plans can you come back in a few years what about my reputation i really like the life that i have now in the temple can you find someone else
4347623 can i trade you the icky purple popsicle for the pretty pink one

4347626 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4347627 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that

4347631 until now we didnt have a movie that was done but now we have a movie starring tom cruise that deserves the best possible playtime
4347632 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4347633 but i always tell my sons follow your passion and ive got to follow that advice myself as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do i still believe in our vision for ua and i am confident that harry sloan and our colleagues at mgm will see that vision through to reality

4347651 ok ok now were onto the other dimension of the nate and falou team

4347656 that can be but what makes you any better youre up here on the same pulpit handing out the same ritz cracker you think youre books are anything more than sheets of toilet paper from the giant roll of shit paper
4347657 no i know im better and it seems that the world knows it too you may have viewers but we have devotees we are selling life cheaper then you could ever dream and our followers know it were the real deal and you are nothing better than the closeted salesman

4347665 estamos acostumbrado que estas cosas pasen en el pa s los empleados dicen que fue una cosa muy r pido y que afortunadamente est todo bien

4347679 el problema al que nos enfrentamos es estimar el n mero de individuos que componen una manada de lobos adultos y subadultos a trav s de las grabaciones de sus coros y colateralmente tambi n intentamos estimar la presencia de cachorros
4347680 este proceso de separaci n proporciona un arma poderosa para el estudio de la estructura de una manada ya que si dos voces tienen frecuencias instant neas proporcionales podemos suponer que se trata de dos arm nicos diferentes producidos por un mismo lobo y si no las tienen pero coinciden en el tiempo podemos asegurar que las emiten individuos distintos lo que nos permite estimar el n mero m nimo de lobos que han aullado o ladrado en el coro
4347681 podemos distinguir el n mero de voces que se escuchan cuando a llan a la vez pero si no suenan simult neamente desconocemos si son emitidas por el mismo individuo o no
4347682 aunque esta podr a ser una l nea de investigaci n futura
4347683 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4347684 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4347685 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4347686 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4347687 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4347688 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds

4347700 the intent of this ordinance is to smear protesters and make them appear as if theyre somehow criminal
4347701 whereas its a new venue its not a new challenge for us
4347702 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
4347703 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
4347704 if you identify the anarchists early and they engage in criminal behavior snatch them up right now
4347705 the further you delay the more damage they can do to the process of legitimate protest
4347706 the moment companies in charlotte or in any place stop hiring undocumented people thats the moment we will actually start seeing the decline
4347707 enforcement is something people are willing to risk in order to provide for their families
4347708 on any given day outside the 7 11 in the village of south hampton there are 60 to 70 workers looking for work
4347709 the fact of the matter is more illegal aliens are being identified arrested and deported
4347710 you could hardly get the signal unless you were near kissimmee or in south orlando
4347711 in the beginning you have to wait for the advertisers to catch up
4347712 it might take awhile but if there are enough ears out there spanish radio will take off and thats whats happened in central florida where there is a good combination of demographics and buying power
4347713 hispanics depend a lot on radio and on radio hosts to explain the news to them
4347714 candidates are finally taking notice of the important role spanish radio plays in opinion making
4347715 the bottom line is that spanish radio is here to stay
4347716 i will be a president who stands with you and fights for you and walks with you every step of the way
4347717 when the system isnt working people who love this country can come together to change it that is the history of the hispanic community in america from fighting to desegregate our schools and neighborhoods to organizing farm workers and to standing up for the rights of immigrants
4347718 make no mistake about it the latino community holds this election in your hands
4347719 the primary focus is to tell latino stories to a national audience that often sees the world in black and white terms
4347720 were really trying to focus on telling deeper stories than what you hear in the media
4347721 in the spirit of the campaign were looking at how we elevate the voices of families
4347722 latino usa covers a segment of families and communities whose voices we want to ensure people hear from
4347723 part of what wed like to do with latino usa in terms of immigrant coverage is to document for all americans that the immigration issue is not just a latino issue
4347724 something ive come to understand more and more is that what were experiencing here in the united states is a worldwide phenomenon in terms of migrants moving across the globe from one place to another
4347725 the u s census projection that hispanics will comprise 30 percent of the u s population by 2050 is only part of the reason our company has its eye on this market segment
4347726 perhaps even more important is the fact that hispanics have a much more intimate relationship with food and cooking and thus with the small kitchen appliances such as george foreman r grills black amp decker r blenders coffeemakers and toaster ovens that our company designs markets and distributes
4347727 we found that hispanics overindex on many of the products we distribute most notably blenders and grills they also comprise a disproportionately large percentage of the two biggest consumer growth targets for us
4347728 one of our most successful blender models was made to address the fact that many consumers there use their blenders as food processors mashing beans creaming corn making salsas and even pureeing hot vegetable soups
4347729 it was no surprise to us then that the model experienced tremendous success once introduced to the u s market because hispanics tend to use blenders in much the same way
4347730 many latinos have no idea they are being price gouged by a hospital
4347731 now there is a free program in spanish to help negotiate reasonable balances and payment plans the anxiety so many victims of hospital price gouging face is being replaced with real concern real help real discounts and real solutions for these patients
4347732 as our culture has become more diversified so has the consumer and the advertiser
4347733 especially now with the increase in the hispanic population people want to see models that look like them with the products that are important to them
4347734 they also like to see and hear those products advertised in spanish
4347735 theres a misconception that hispanics dont have a lot of money to spend which is not true at all
4347736 in kern county hispanics spend more than 2 6 billion annually and thats green money that is spent on the same things everyone else spends their money on
4347737 this is the kind of thing that helps to change the image of latinas in our country we have beautiful latina women thats for sure
4347738 my mom wanted to keep me busy and i had injured my back so i couldnt continue with soccer and cheerleading
4347739 growing up i was always the first one to jump in front of the camera
4347740 i think the most important thing is to have confidence not be vain and treat everyone professionally and with respect
4347741 my mom used to act so i grew up around it and i did acting in school
4347742 i love the fact that when youre acting you can put yourself in any situation and be someone youre not

4347747 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region

4347773 there are battles pretty much everywhere chizik said at his opening season press conference the one everyone is probably interested in is the quarterback battle that is the one that everyone sees the most but there are battles going on all over our football team because you were a starter the previous year does not mean you ve inherited a position the next year
4347774 i tell the team theres always a winner and a loser
4347775 i have a mess of onions to use up what can i make out of it
4347776 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4347777 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4347778 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4347779 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4347780 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4347781 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4347782 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4347783 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4347784 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4347785 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4347786 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4347787 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4347788 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4347789 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4347795 dieses pferd l sst einen gut aussehen wir sind superfroh dass wir es trotz aller unkenrufe geschafft haben
4347796 da hatte man ein bisschen mehr erwartet aber es waren zu viele kleinigkeiten
4347797 das was wir uns vorgenommen haben hat nicht ganz geklappt
4347798 bei mir h tte es besser laufen k nnen so zwei drei prozentpunkte mehr

4347800 wij waarschuwen alle zeelieden monstergolven zijn geen fabeltjes we hebben keiharde bewijzen dat witte tijgers bestaan
4347801 rijkswaterstaat heeft domweg te weinig boeien in zee liggen om betrouwbare uitspraken te doen
4347802 zijn wij nou gek geworden of is de conclusie van het rikz erg kort door de bocht
4347803 es ist nicht wichtig wer in dieser situation pr sident ist
4347804 es sind zuvor nicht alle diplomatischen m glichkeiten ausgesch pft worden und niemand in georgien glaubt im ernst dass man einen krieg gegen russland gewinnen kann
4347805 ich werde den pr sidenten nicht aus paris kritisieren jetzt ist nicht die zeit und dies ist nicht der ort jetzt m ssen wir alles tun um georgiens wirtschaftliche und politische unabh ngigkeit zu verteidigen
4347806 wie wahnsinnig muss man sein einen krieg gegen russland zu beginnen
4347807 aber er hat in drei tagen unser land zerst rt
4347808 es geht nicht darum ob ich f r saakaschwili bin er ist jetzt mein pr sident und es geht um das schicksal unseres heimatland
4347809 aber nat rlich war es ein fehler die milit rische l sung zu suchen jetzt haben wir so viele opfer zu beklagen das war es nicht wert
4347810 europa will eben auch im winter in warmen stuben sitzen
4347811 europa und amerika werden niemals f r demokratie und freiheit k mpfen das haben wir jetzt gesehen sie haben ja schon bei unseren wahlen beide augen fest geschlossen
4347812 saakaschwili wird keine ernsthaften probleme bekommen solange es keine alternativen zu ihm gibt n mlich politiker von format
4347813 wir haben es seit der revolution nicht geschafft die formel f r einen demokratischen staat zu verwirklichen und diese formel hei t balance durch gewaltenteilung

4347823 regarding indonesias 63rd anniversary of independence 385 prisoners in kerobokan prison will receive a sentence reduction or remission
4347824 from that number 42 people will immediately be released because their service period is over
4347825 among the prisoners to get remission there are seven foreign citizens including schapelle corby and renae lawrence
4347826 but it is still only a recommendation the official announcement will be on august 17

4347828 ich habe die augen zugemacht und bin nur mein rennen geschwommen ich kann es noch gar nicht fassen beim anschlag habe ich nur die libby gesehen dann habe ich auf die anzeigetafel geschaut und es realisiert
4347829 das ist ein wahnsinnsgef hl ich habe nie gedacht dass mir dieser letzte durchbruch gelingt
4347830 vor dem rennen hat mein trainer norbert warnatzsch gesagt dass ich keine experimente machen und die ruhe bewahren soll
4347831 mit uns ist auch nach den ausf llen zu rechnen wir stehen fast sicher im viertelfinale dort geht es dann erst richtig los uns darf man nicht abschreiben

4347836 das muss man erst mal verkraften das ist so als ob bei den franzosen narcisse karabatic und fernandez ausfallen wir sind aber als mannschaft gefestigt
4347837 da der deutsche aber ein brot ohne konservierungsmittel will hat der gesetzgeber gesagt kein problem wir ernennen das natriumdiacetat zum s uerungsmittel

4347843 what are we going to do about the death of photography

4347860 the essence of the program is to obtain very very precise measurements for each and every part of the model
4347861 these measurements will be fed into the computer which will then allow us to determine what clothes will fit you best and how plastic surgery can make easy changes to your body to make you convey a particular persona

4347867 when can we begin sir she asked in a very nervous voice

4347869 he is probably the most successful modeling consultant in italy i have selected him to be your consultant he will spend a lot of time with you please do as he says it will be for your own good
4347870 i also want you to meet dr steven cummings he is one of the worlds best plastic surgeons he will also help in taking the measurements so he can later decide on what course to take
4347871 before that we have some legal stuff we must take care of
4347872 here are some release documents you must read and sign before we can begin
4347873 you enter into contract with paramount at your own risk you must indemnify parmount for all damages against us and you must waive your right to suit
4347874 you will find my figure very appealing i trust you will guide me on what you want me to do
4347875 if you will please step up on the pedestal now jessica
4347876 now jessica i want you to relax just relax your body and pose as you would do for a glamour photo shoot we will guide you through the process
4347877 please bend down jessica i want you to touch your toes
4347878 we can now begin taking measurements now antonio stated please let me assure you that we are a team here and there are no need to be embarrassed dr steve and i are doing everything most diligently some of the measurements here may cause some embarrassment but we must provide as accurately as possible all data that the computer program calls for
4347879 i i understand jessica stammered not knowing what to expect
4347880 you may pull on your panties now jessica dr steve instructed
4347881 we must first take your height and weight then your bust waist arms legs hips distance between eyes ears and other very detailed measurements
4347882 we can start by using a tailors tape to take your measurements while you are standing on this pedestal
4347883 we have calipers to take measurements such as the diameters of your arms legs fingers breasts and nipples
4347884 this instrument measures internal dimensions dr steve explained the device had a cord that could be connected to a computer to automatically transfer data to the computer as well as send stimulating electrical impulses to the subject if necessary
4347885 we will then have you lie down in several positions on a bed dr steve said while we make some internal measurements
4347886 what are we going to do about the death of photography
4347887 zumindest im jenseits f r ihre handlungen aufs sch rfste bestraft

4347889 man wei nie was f r bakterien und keime sich daran befinden
4347890 ich habe vor drei vier jahren angefangen im internet zu recherchieren
4347891 ich bin nicht der erste und nicht der einzige der das schreibt
4347892 die botschaft ist dass homosexuelle sich nicht nur gegen gott vers ndigen sondern auch eine gefahr f r die gesellschaft darstellen
4347893 und wenn ich sage dass schwule und lesben nicht schlechter sind als wir dass man sie nicht schlagen oder verarschen muss dann ist das sicher ganz gut
4347894 what are we going to do about the death of photography
4347895 its not heres a check come back in a year
4347896 we have done a lot of work on how social behavior interacts with social technology but we dont really have the tools to take on a project like dr brynjolfssons
4347897 we now have a commitment that we are going to do research together i feel responsible for the success of their project
4347898 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4347899 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4347900 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4347901 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4347902 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4347903 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4347904 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4347905 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer
4347906 kann gar nicht in dem prozentsatz rauf und runter gehen
4347907 hier sind die dieselpreise um 18 prozent gesunken und die superpreise um 14 prozent das w re zumindestens ein wert den man auch in sterreich an den tankstellen erwarten w rde
4347908 prices of everything are going up but my wages sure arent
4347909 what are we going to do about the death of photography
4347910 most of the top execs of the manufacturers are over 50 and dont know what their own products do
4347911 so they stopped thinking about how to make phones more cost effective
4347912 he has the power to unite the marketing and technology and business groups unfortunately japanese companies arent structured that way
4347913 i hope the iphones introduction leads to a sense of crisis at japanese handset makers
4347914 they have been coddled in this market the iphone could be the trigger that forces them to make changes
4347915 it was kind of cool to sit back there and watch all that happen
4347916 although all my times werent exactly there during this meet im very happy with the results
4347917 apparently it takes a world record to win an event peirsol said
4347918 i was just trying to control my race as much as possible
4347919 you definitely can swim faster out there said wildman tobriner who tied amaury leveaux for fourth in his heat with a time of 21 76 seconds
4347920 number 14780 to carry out the reaping of david appleton an average man with short dark hair parted on the left side and dull green eyes lacking luster
4347921 what if i go in the bathroom right now and slit my wrists youll take me then right
4347922 because you believe you will but you will not have the courage to complete the task
4347923 i am not aware of the existence of hell i only know it will take longer for you to die you may as well stab your heart why linger if you only want to end it quickly
4347924 i am known as the fate sealer no one can escape their fate
4347925 what a name you have lets see if we can come up with something more suitable
4347926 im afraid lunar pie doesnt have any of your handsome features
4347927 you said you loved lunar pie you said it was your favorite pie
4347928 i thought if i named her something you love you would love her
4347929 though i must tell you when riona is ready to fulfill her destiny she will take her true form this you can not stop
4347930 i guess i wont have to worry about painting the house now
4347931 i have to go scrappers is my guide to arwenia
4347932 that was quite a spill you took youve got to be more careful
4347933 shes in arwenia its of another time and place than your human earth
4347934 our daughter is at this moment saving her land and becoming the queen
4347935 so why are all these people still here if its not rionas birthday what day is it
4347936 this is funny but could you make and could you make the pie a cake and while youre at it can you just change all of this
4347937 a morass of bickering infighting and sometimes out and out name calling
4347938 while the browser makers are fighting over which version of javascript they should support why and when flash looks to the future and is able to progress and evolve independently of the browser
4347939 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4347940 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4347941 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4347942 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4347943 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4347944 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4347945 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4347946 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4347947 as i said to you after her first match i am just looking to find my rhythm which i did tonight
4347948 i was happy not to spend too much time on court
4347949 a player like mark has that experience and is able to fit a certain hole in terms of our squad list
4347950 he was the right person for that position that didnt exist off contract at the moment in rugby in australia
4347951 clinton has travelled a similar path and his opinion is one we respect
4347952 he was adamant that mark will be an absolute hit in the game
4347953 positionally weve obviously got some ideas about him playing in the back three but theres no reason why he couldnt play elsewhere
4347954 you have to make a decision how much coverage do you want to push out to the receiver and how wide open do you want to leave that middle corridor
4347955 if you can threaten all three of those areas outside and up the middle its a stretch on the opposing defenses
4347956 the play is a really good look at how a tight end can affect the defense
4347957 deep down the middle of the field he gets over the top catches it they miss one tackle and you go the distance
4347958 que el mundo fue y ser una porquer a ya lo s en el 506 y en el 2000 tambi n

4347961 in our view she played a significant role in causing the falsification of corporate records and the reporting of false information to the public
4347962 isnt an admission its a recognition that life is short
4347963 weve sued two people from apple both of those people have settled
4347964 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4347965 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4347966 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4347967 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4347968 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4347969 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4347970 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4347971 of course the girls were old enough to compete people always criticise the gold medal winners

4348138 everything is so contrived thats why i think it was a setup
4348139 i think they meant to kill her with a bag of stuff on her but it went wrong somehow
4348140 no country can take unilateral action regarding the caspian sea
4348141 there has been an intensification of russian military activity in the south ossetian region
4348142 military operations against georgian forces in the conflict zone have escalated dramatically
4348143 russia has been attacking villages and cities elsewhere in georgia including threatening the zug didi region and air attacks against tbilisis airport russian military attacks have also destroyed critical georgian infrastructure including seaports airports and other facilities
4348144 t he result of this escalation against a sovereign state that has not posed direct threat to russia has increased casualties and humanitarian suffering for the people of georgia including in south ossetia and abkhazia
4348145 offered a cease fire and restoration of the status quo
4348146 russia continues to resist efforts by the international community to mediate this conflict
4348147 w e must condemn the russian military assault in sic the sovereign state of georgia the violation of the countries sic sovereignty and territorial integrity including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population similarly we need to condemn the destruction of georgian infrastructure and violations of the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity
4348148 was russias objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of that country
4348149 it is not a part of our political culture or foreign policy to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
4348150 this statement ambassador is completely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
4348151 police chief ghanim al quraishi gave orders to organize the fighting in this district hwaider very secretly
4348152 the 2nd battalion of iraqi police moved to hwaider whose people witnessed severe military clashes between the mahdi army and police
4348153 a big verbal quarrel took place earlier in the governors office between al quraishi who is a badr member and followers of sadr
4348154 decision of a small country in the caucasus to essentially launch a war no matter
4348155 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
4348156 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
4348157 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
4348158 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4348159 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4348160 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4348161 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
4348162 no other human activity gives it greater scope no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder
4348163 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4348164 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4348165 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4348166 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4348167 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of warmaking on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4348168 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4348169 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4348170 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4348171 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4348172 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4348173 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4348174 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4348175 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4348176 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4348177 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4348178 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4348179 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4348180 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4348181 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said
4348182 i can just hear mccain barnstorming the country in 08 denouncing russian imperialism and demanding that we stop putin in the caucasus before russian troops cross the bering straits

4348187 the cat form is thought to truly only infect cats at this point but theyre not sure because they get a lot of conflicting information from different testing facilities and stuff like that
4348188 its very very difficult to treat there is no known actual cure you cant just put them on a pill and cure them
4348189 i came and scouted it out yesterday so im prepared
4348190 one of the things i never realized before was how much time teachers put in even before school starts and how many of their own resources they put into their classrooms and their students
4348191 i think people here often dont know how teachers are paying out of their pockets to supply their rooms and make them ready this is a small way we can help
4348192 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4348193 i cannot image what would drive somebody to do that
4348194 very strong very determined i dont know what id do in his position im proud of him i can tell you that im proud of him
4348195 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
4348196 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
4348197 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
4348198 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
4348199 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
4348200 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
4348201 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
4348202 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
4348203 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
4348204 bringing the police officers back into the communities and the businesses along wells road also working closely with jacksonville sheriffs office identifying criminals coming out of jacksonville and coming into clay county
4348205 operation night sight is an operation that we began 1 5 year ago in response to operation safe streets that sheriff rutherford began in jacksonville sheriff rutherford said that when we put the number of officers on the street in jacksonville that we are doing its going to push criminals into clay county and weve seen that impact but what we did is form a cooperative agreement between the florida highway patrol the u s marshals service and the clay county sheriffs office to infuse a dynamic police presence in the northern end of the county that operation night sight has been every effective in keeping that area from keeping more of an increase in crime than weve seen
4348206 with little old ladies being carjacked in wal mart parking lots in broad open daylight with stabbing and gunfights in the mall i would disagree that the criminals fear clay county and i do have a plan to address that first we put experienced law enforcement commanders in command positions next we re implement national accreditation we network with our sister agencies in other counties our state partners and our federal partners and we go fight crime
4348207 ive never ever exercised any attempt in any way whatsoever to have charges dropped against myself or any family member ever
4348208 my charge has never been arrested hes never been charged and its absolutely despicable that folks would bring this up in a political campaign
4348209 weve tried to keep it on a high plane there have been no negative advertisements coming from my campaign ive never spoken ill of either of my opponents in public or in private
4348210 sometimes your supporters they get a little bit overly aggressive and its difficult to control them we try to make sure they dont do anything unethical or tasteless but those sort of things do happen
4348211 if you go back to beginning of my campaign youll see that i have been very straight and forward with my issues
4348212 i have a plan for future of clay county i dont get sidetracked by the negativity thats going on between my two opponents
4348213 ive never been a politician ive never wanted to be one and never thought id be here i can tell you the only thing ive underestimated in politics is how dirty some folks would be
4348214 ive encouraged all of our supporters to not stoop to those levels its inappropriate and we should not do it

4348217 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4348218 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4348219 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4348220 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4348221 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4348222 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4348223 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4348224 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4348225 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4348226 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4348227 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4348228 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4348229 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4348230 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4348231 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4348232 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4348233 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4348234 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4348235 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4348236 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4348237 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4348238 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4348239 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4348240 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4348241 the fact that hes related to ralph wasnt the primary reason for choosing him primarily i went for hero because of this wonderful haunted quality
4348242 the extraordinary transfer of wealth that took place between ordinary households and the extremely well to do and the effort by this administration to address the consequences of that problem without addressing the root cause
4348243 economy did in fact grow at a reasonably strong pace through most of the bush presidency
4348244 drained the american consumer of the resources needed to keep the economy humming
4348245 the percentage by which the effective tax rate was cut for high income families was nearly twice the rate cut for those in the middle of the income spectrum
4348246 those among the top 10 percent of all households on average increased their income by about 2 percent while those in the bottom 90 percent lost more than 4 percent
4348247 biggest beneficiaries of u s economic growth that occurred between 2000 and 2006 were u s corporations
4348248 at a little less than two thirds the growth rate of the gross domestic product
4348249 corporate profits grew nearly four times as fast as gdp
4348250 which accounted for 95 3 percent of the nations income growth between 2002 and 2006

4348253 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4348254 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4348255 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4348256 will mccains cynical lies destroy the chance for serious energy and climate policy

4348274 one of the most pressing challenges facing the school district is how to rapidly boost african american performance
4348275 we have no hope of achieving our overall goals as a district unless we make substantial strides with this particular group of students
4348276 its fundamentally so affirming of what is possible for our kids
4348277 our schools can do it our kids can do it and our district can do it
4348278 i think oakland has all of the knowledge and expertise it needs
4348279 i think its about how we build on our successes more
4348280 thats not surprising actually given the lack of focus on high school performance in the last five to 10 years
4348281 high schools are lagging the most not just in california but across the nation
4348282 its as if we feel that this is a lost cause
4348283 they would absolutely have to be at the end of their tether to call the police
4348284 a lot of parents dont even know they can call the police with these kinds of issues its absolutely the last step
4348285 parents are trying to compensate for not being available they are generally wanting to give their kids the best
4348286 then the kids just start to use quite bullying tactics and slowly over time they will start to up the ante until they are smashing things and becoming quite abusive
4348287 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4348288 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
4348289 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
4348290 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
4348291 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
4348292 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

4348298 we are positionally holy god has saved us through his son jesus but we are not practically holy
4348299 if you dont have a concept of gods holiness you wont understand pursuing practical holiness
4348300 jesus has redeemed you from a life of silliness and folly he said
4348301 you were saved to pursue holiness why in the world would you want to go back to your old way of living
4348302 hide it in your heart you must have unhurried and unhindered time with god in the word
4348303 holy people go out bragging about god dont isolate yourself do good deeds among the gentiles
4348304 you need to make your presence known to people in places such as the student affairs office
4348305 if they know you are there and are willing to help it will be beneficial
4348306 we need to attract some of the top students on our campuses but we also need to attract the people who wouldnt have anyone else if they didnt have us
4348307 about 99 percent of our college students in new england are unchurched
4348308 all they know about christianity is what theyve seen through the media which is nearly always negative we hear the most positive portrayal on television about christians is the simpsons evangelism for us is a huge challenge
4348309 we have a bcm presence on 275 campuses but our state convention only has about 240 churches
4348310 we tell them hey guys its good here on campus but you need to get plugged in with a church too
4348311 you want the student the finished bcm product to be a christian involved in his church
4348312 let them look at you and see that you are involved in your church as an individual
4348313 i teach a sunday school class and am on committees at my church and they know that
4348314 one thing arliss said that really struck me was that our face will be the face of our collegiate ministry
4348315 we have to be willing to do the work and take responsibility
4348316 its good just to realize we do know a lot about how to minister to college students
4348317 its also a great time to be around all these other leaders who deal with the same issues and hear what they do
4348318 god called thousands of preachers but only a few collegiate ministers
4348319 the brady boys are so perfect we hope our kids take after them
4348320 in america we are a culture of african american christians caucasian christians hispanic christians asian christians and on and on
4348321 that isnt scriptural and you know i dont want to limit jesus to just my culture
4348322 if you are going to south america to work with a people group you dont know anything about you google it and find out what they eat what they wear how they speak how they act
4348323 you are excited you want to know everything you dont want to offend anyone
4348324 in effect we are saying that our own culture is more important than jesus

4348331 weve been fighting very hard day and night for four days but after today the water level should recede
4348332 i performed very badly on the first day it was a terrible shame not because i didnt win a medal but because i let so many people down
4348333 but they all gave me lots of support and encouragement
4348334 i wasnt in a good mood and i just wanted to quit it had all become meaningless

4348337 came over to me and gave me a very big hug and sincere hopes and wishes i was really touched by that

4348395 oh ho ho guess he was alive master ang and i are both masters of the bear blade style i kind of had a feeling you were more then meets the eye ben akamaru the way you handled the blade and parry that was pure bear blade style now using the ki points that was just a technique to use when you are unarmed but you used your swords hilt to inflict pain as well as closing the ki veins
4348396 i thought that since you knew brothers former master you might know mine
4348397 viper sword style what a wicked style that is i may not know of your master this ake guy but i do know of your style can take out a hundred men in a matter of seconds if you are a master of it bear blade is more about brute force that will guarantee a good kill by either slicing or tearing the opponent in two depending on the type of blade
4348398 my name is cedric law so am i to believe that those the viper user and shield guy over there are of akamaru village as well artemis and trent nod and this girl ashley glares at him will be a fine mother for your children someday
4348399 im not his girlfriend im not his wife im not his lover will you backwater idiots stop thinking that
4348400 well why else would a woman follow a group if its not for love it is rare for a woman to seek vengeance or power well the evil queen in the past was an exception she was crazy to try to take over the world
4348401 speaking of the the crazy evil queen of the past another relic of the past is what we are searching we are looking for the tome of the seventh warrior we found a place that might hold it but we need four more living weapons that will fit the holes as keys
4348402 oh youre talking about the ruins east of here oh ho ho those arent ruins left by the seventh warrior that is rumored to hold something evil come with me to my place ill talk more there looks to the crowd well since we have the real fighters here we can still party as you were
4348403 its amazing what a few magic talismans will do for you looks at ben about to snap now now no need being tense this spell for this house was set long ago when i was younger in fact magic is a part of every human the ki that is mixed with mana is natural in all humans the mana for spells is the force of nature that one brings into their body and mix with their ki to cast spells but the mixture of the two forces are crucial too much of either could have adverse effects instead of casting a spell for rain you could end up with frogs or slugs raining from the damn sky
4348404 master ang never used magic when he was in the village
4348405 yeah the user focuses his or her ki into their blade and swings to release the energy focused in the shape of a crescent moon
4348406 even if we never realize it a little bit of mana is absorbed into the blade to try to balance out the ki overload from the moment you first used the energy wave you were a magical swordsman young ben
4348407 bear blade users are known for the energy wave and thus are known to be magicians most of us are just your everyday people who learn to use little magic for things like this house but there is one bear blade user who is very well know bartimus omega hinsu the seventh warrior was the originator of the bear blade style and was a magician as well ben falls to his rear in disbelief guess fred never told you about that did he
4348408 master law the reason why brother is having such a hard time accepting this is because he hates magos he didnt want me to use magic even after coatl came to life
4348409 that would explain why his own blade is laughing like an idiot in a pub
4348410 who are you calling an idiot in a pub old man
4348411 you sword you were laughing at your master now i know it is funny but you know him more then anyone and should sympathize with him
4348412 are you kidding me old man he may be my master and creator but that doesnt mean ill be completely obidient not like some pet this is one of the few times i might get to laugh that hard at him instead of with him
4348413 well whether you believe it or not the energy wave is a basic attack if you were to use it with your particular element you can use then the wave will intensify also being a master i can create an energy wave from anything including my pinky
4348414 like so all of the bear blade styles are basic with ki energy but can become a level stronger when you embrace your magical abilities they can even kill more magos when you aim them well
4348415 this will take some getting use to the energy wave is a magic attack and i didnt notice it
4348416 albert parsons believed a strong socialist movement needed to follow the prescription put forward by karl marx that is such a movement needed a mass working class following
4348417 for the international to be a real power it must be able to organise within its ranks the immense majority of the proletariat of europe of america of all lands
4348418 the natural organisation of the masses is organisation based on the various ways that their various types of work define their day to day life it is organisation by trade association
4348419 every occupation is represented within the international its organisation the organisation of the masses of the people will be complete
4348420 but a single path that of emancipation through practical action which meant
4348421 the working class had to have its own institutions and its own militia its own communal forms of decision making
4348422 the alliance of all labour associations will constitute the commune there will be a standing federation of the barricades and a revolutionary communal council made up of delegates invested with binding mandates and accountable and revocable at all times all provinces communes and associations will delegate deputies to an agreed place of assembly all invested with binding mandated and accountable and subject to recall in order to found the federation of insurgent associations communes and provinces and to organise a revolutionary force with the capacity of defeating the reaction it is through the very act of extrapolation and organisation of the revolution with an eye to the mutual defences of insurgent areas that the universality of the revolution will emerge triumphant
4348423 we hold that the granges trade unions knights of labour assemblies etc are the embryonic groups of the ideal anarchistic society
4348424 organisation of the trade sections their federation in the international and their representation by chambers of labour allow the workers to combin e theory and practice and bear in themselves the living germs of the social order which is to replace the bourgeois world they are creating not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself
4348425 the sailors were threatening an armed rebellion and demanding that the bolsheviks be purged from the soviets
4348426 soviets without communists was not as is often maintained by both soviet and non soviet writers a kronstadt slogan
4348427 did allow a place for the bolsheviks in the soviets alongside the other left wing organisations communists participated in strength in the elected conference of delegate which was the closest thing kronstadt ever had to the free soviets of its dreams
4348428 overnight petrograd became an armed camp in every quarter pedestrians were stopped and their documents checked the curfew was strictly enforced
4348429 the mensheviks political comeback the elections to the provincial city soviets in spring 1918 the russian review vol
4348430 left the bolsheviks suspended in air controlling the state machine but lacking a social base
4348431 as discontent amongst workers became more and more difficult to ignore lenin
4348432 today the technique of the big lie is apparently alive and well but the fact that he was moved to level his absurd accusations is an indication that trotskys life and ideas continue to resonate with a layer of political activists and that at least is cause for a little optimism
4348433 leadership was principally against anti semitism or alliances with the whites
4348434 makhnos role as a leader of peasant counterrevolution in the ussr
4348435 timeline and version of events is well refuted by darch
4348436 the political commissar of the trans dnepr division complained that anarchist and left sr agitation was making his work very difficult
4348437 despite the seriousness of the military situation for the red army and for the revolution in general the congress apparently felt no compunction about adopting and endorsing an anarchist platform that the bolsheviks inevitably viewed as a provocation
4348438 parties were banned from organizing for election to regional bodies
4348439 it seems apparent that many workers themselves had now come to believe that confusion and anarchy sic at the top were the major causes of their difficulties and with some justification the fact was that bolshevik administration was chaotic scores of competitive and conflicting bolshevik and soviet authorities issued contradictory orders often brought to factories by armed chekists the supreme economic council issu ed dozens of orders and pass ed countless directives with virtually no real knowledge of affairs
4348440 a number of local bolshevik officials began in the fall of 1918 to call for the restoration of workers control not for ideological reasons but because workers themselves knew best how to run the line efficiently and might obey their own central committees directives if they were not being constantly countermanded
4348441 no party has a right to usurp governmental power into its own hands we want life all problems to be decided locally not by order from any authority above and all peasants and workers should decide their own fate while those elected should only carry out the toilers wish
4348442 seem almost to believe that after having brought down government and private property we would allow both to be quietly built up again because of respect for the freedom of those who might feel the need to be rulers and property owners a truly curious way of interpreting our ideas
4348443 eminently theological metaphysical and political idea that the masses always incapable of governing themselves must submit at all times to the benevolent yoke of a wisdom and a justice which in one way or another is imposed from above
4348444 but left in control of territory that they wanted to secure the makhnovists ended up forming what most would call a state they organized regional legislative conferences they controlled armed detachments to enforce their policies they banned authority with which they disagreed to prevent those hostile to our political ideas from establishing themselves the makhnovists used their military authority to suppress rival political ideas and organizations
4348445 why did self proclaimed anarchists create a state they were not confused or impure they built a state because they had no choice ultimately states are coercive instruments whereby one class rules society a workers state is unique in history because the class wielding power does so in the interests of the vast majority
4348446 i n the midst of a civil war the makhnovists emptied all the prisons and jails
4348447 b y popular government the marxists mean government of the people by a small under of representatives elected by the people
4348448 government of the vast majority of the people by a privileged minority but this minority the marxists say will consist of workers yes perhaps of former workers who as soon as they become rulers or representatives of the people will cease to be workers and will begin to look upon the whole workers world from the heights of the state they will no longer represent the people but themselves and their own pretensions to govern the people
4348449 very same masses are at different times inspired by different moods and objectives it is just for this reason that a centralised organisation of the vanguard is indispensable only a party wielding the authority it has won is capable of overcoming the vacillation of the masses themselves
4348450 an objective necessity imposed upon us by the social realities the class struggle the heterogeneity of the revolutionary class the necessity for a selected vanguard in order to assure the victory
4348451 revolutionary party vanguard which renounces its own dictatorship surrenders the masses to the counter revolution
4348452 the dictatorship of the whole toiling people without any party
4348453 capitalism does not permit the material and the moral development of the masses
4348454 d uring the civil war the ukraine was far from a classless society as the actions of the makhnovists show
4348455 had repeatedly declared overwhelming hostility to the dictatorship of the proletariat and had nothing but vague platitudes to offer as a substitute
4348456 their utopian views prevented them from uniting with the workers state
4348457 the makhnovists were organized with an approach of anarchism from above as the peasant army would roll into a town and obliterate existing state structures before moving on
4348458 only restriction that the makhnovists considered necessary to impose on the bolsheviks the left socialist revolutionaries and other statists was a prohibition on the formation of those revolutionary committees which sought to impose a dictatorship over the people
4348459 but the strength required to fundamentally transform society and set it on new foundations cannot exist only among the enlightened few who get it instead it is found in the collective energy and self activity of the working class with their hand on the lever of production only the working class can revolutionise society the russian experience demonstrates they will need a state when they do so to defend their new gains
4348460 on three occasions in the first months of soviet power the factory committees leaders sought to bring their model of workers self management of the economy into being at each point the party leadership overruled them the bolshevik alternative was to vest both managerial and control powers in organs of the state which were subordinate to the central authorities and formed by them
4348461 when workers power next establishes itself its wielders will have to put tremendous energy into helping workers in other countries in their project of self emancipation
4348462 makhno had no generalized plan or vision for the future
4348463 the beginnings of the social changes for which the revolution had been fought
4348464 the sword and the gun to keep the people out
4348465 to side with the master class which in russia is called the communist party
4348466 merely state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people

4348505 her biker jacket is the one constant in a life filled with frantic taxi rides to gritty shows and spontaneous trips to london or tokyo she is nostalgic for the raw energy of new york city in the 80s
4348506 although shes a power broker or a ceiling breaker of some kind shes in love with the style of wallis franken designer claude montanas muse she wants clothes that propel her
4348507 the new breed of party girl is haunted by the ghosts of 70s nightclubbers at regines and everything about her is sly stealth and mutedly sexy from her slick hair to her shifts her life is an uncompromising homage to the decadence of the wee hours where neither a hair nor a seam is out of place even at sunrise
4348508 shes about breaking the rules from her tribal jewelry collection to her dinner conversation shes a world traveler and a collector and her clothes are an eclectic reminder of cultures and sights seen
4348509 shes the evolutionary outcome of years of careful pedigree and generations of ice queens shes a nostalgic who collects sterling table lighters and conjures hitchcock blonds when she gets dressed

4348536 when you have a government of national unity and it is a meaningful one what you really need to be doing is to be making sure that all services including security and military are reflecting the fact that you now have a unity government and that theyre not favoring one party over another otherwise theres no point in having an agreement
4348537 there have to be guarantees about a whole host of things including the military and everybody else and security in all other institutions are going to behave and we are going to make sure that whatever arrangement is made is reflecting on the fact that we need to move forward and not move backwards like you saw happening in passports being withheld and people being told they cannot go to meetings
4348538 it is distinctly possible that zanu pf is trying to plant a seed of discord among the parties but arthur mutambara from what i understand denied that there has been any agreement worked out with mugabe that is separate from another agreement and at any rate if they try to make an arrangement without tsvangirai it wouldnt go anywhere because the people of zimbabwe would like to see the movement for democratic change in a situation of control from now on so they can go ahead and make whatever arrangements they want to make they will be meaningless totally

4348541 it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy
4348542 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation
4348543 it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country
4348544 it will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4348545 but there are handicaps which have adversely affected our atomic energy programme we have inadequate production of uranium the quality of our uranium resources is not comparable to those of other producers
4348546 many countries have imposed sanctions on trade with india in nuclear materials nuclear equipment and nuclear technology as a result our nuclear energy programme has suffered

4348570 listen pal you need to get off your high horse at the home i visited the dorms for volunteers was far away from the childrens dorm and all other buildings children were almost never alone they were constantly playing with each other the man who runs the home is familiar with child abuse many of the children were victims at the refugee camp before he took them in and the kids are well watched over by the older children and a couple of adult helpers while there are no guarentees it is a weighed risk just like trusting a local soccer coach or camp counselor
4348571 i suppose your answer of returning these children to the refugee camp where they can look forward to severe malnourishment sexual abuse no educational opportunities and minimal if any health care this makes a lot of sense
4348572 your knowledge of this area is obviously minimal at best you know nothing of pragmatics and reality access to children is not being sold to gain funds as you so crudely put it
4348573 and what you do to benefit others you must run several orphanages since you speak as if you were an expert on their management

4348603 consider the homosexuals attitude toward such virtues as fidelity and loyalty no self respecting woman would tolerate infidelity in her husband but in the homosexual community infidelity is not only allowed it is a given it is ironic that homosexuals demand such respect from the general community when they quite obviously have little respect for themselves or one another

4348605 outsourcing of public services to the private and voluntary sectors has almost doubled to close to 80bn in little more than a decade and makes up a far larger part of the economy than previously thought
4348606 the market is worth 79bn employs almost as many people as the nhs and accounts for 6 per cent of gross domestic product making it a larger industrial sector than pharmaceuticals automotive or electricity gas and water
4348607 twenty years ago too many things were being done in the public sector it ossified
4348608 honestly some people are still sitting here with their jaws dropping saying how did it happen it was just so fast

4348610 all of a sudden you look around and think joe across the street lost his job or oh my gosh sally next door lost their job
4348611 the adverse effects would not have been confined to the financial system but would have been felt broadly in the real economy through its effects on asset values and credit availability
4348612 we conclude that the human rights situation in colombia is serious and shows little sign of improvement we further conclude that allegations of extra judicial executions by the colombian military and the continued targeting of trade unionists cannot be ignored we therefore believe it is inappropriate for the government to provide military aid to colombia without any reference to human rights improvements
4348613 noting recent moves by the us congress to freeze some aid to colombia on human rights grounds we recommend that the government should request the colombian military to demonstrate measurable and verifiable human rights improvements in exchange for future assistance
4348614 accurately to reflect the seriousness of the human rights situation
4348615 units implicated in serious human rights abuses such as the high mountain brigades
4348616 the problem is that the military aid the british government grant to colombia is unconditional with regard to any kind of human rights improvements we think that that sends a bad message the military in colombia will go on getting these military goodies without having to do anything in return with respect to human rights
4348617 the uk seems to be being saddled with a policy that even the american government have moved beyond after the democrats took control of congress last year they froze some military aid to colombia on human rights grounds we think that the uk should at least get back into step with the policy of the americans
4348618 the issue of examining the details of how uk military aid is deployed in colombia which the government wishes to remain secret is somewhat distinct from the issue of whether uk aid is being leveraged to extract the maximum human rights benefits in the country which the government has also refused to comment on with the latter being the more important question
4348619 the president of the bolivarian republic of venezuela hugo ch vez fr as together with the venezuelan people celebrates the victory achieved by the valiant bolivian people today

4348672 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
4348673 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers
4348674 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports

4348694 there was increasing pressure from trade unions around the world as well as from the ituc there has also been an easing of tensions between the histadrut and the pgftu in the past 18 months so it was possible to finally get the agreement back on track
4348695 people were using this to have a go at israel
4348696 the reinstating of this agreement makes the calls to boycott flounder

4348711 the feeling is that they are planning to humiliate sakaashvili further and that they will not stop until they have toppled his government

4348731 this is the most amazing proposition that has ever been brought forward and if it is accurate it could change the whole outcome of the voting process in the united states and we will take that under consideration we we eagerly embrace your suggestion
4348732 the voting rights act of 1965 as amended its history and current issues
4348733 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4348734 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4348735 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4348736 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4348737 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4348738 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4348739 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4348740 do not continue to speak to me further about this matter

4348751 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
4348752 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4348753 they didnt carry any avalanche transceivers or probes and they didnt have a shovel each as far as im aware
4348754 travelling in the mountains in winter carrying that should be mandatory they would have been able to dig each other out in an avalanche
4348755 for us it didnt seem like they had a lot they rented a couple of pairs of plastic climbing boots and some harnesses as far as im aware they seemed to have the basics like packs and clothing they were really well set up with that
4348756 it is an extreme environment its an alpine area a place where you need to be on your game
4348757 at the moment were in a sizeable storm and theres been about 1m of snow up in the mountains and no visibility
4348758 over the whole area the avalanche risk is high to extreme
4348759 they would be experiencing below freezing temperatures if theyre exposed it could be 5c to 8c with strong winds and driving snow
4348760 hopefully they are holed up in a snow cave somewhere
4348761 there were times when i was doing jack when i actually felt retarded like really retarded

4348773 stifling political expression pressuring influential media and targeting vocal critics and opposition leaders
4348774 these offences occurred at st pius x high school in adamstown the charlestown parish and taree parish
4348775 police will also be reliant upon evidence of similar facts pertaining to offences committed at waverley college by a further complainant
4348776 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women the statement says
4348777 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help he said
4348778 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
4348779 in one case we heard of a man bringing in a brazilian pornographic photo and saying make my girlfriend look like this dr weaver said
4348780 we dont think it is ethical behaviour to agree to do that
4348781 it is often not clear where the g spot is or if it even exists at all in some women he said
4348782 so the procedure is done without that being verified often causing problems in sex
4348783 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge

4348801 the fall in prices of crude oil is a very positive and good sign but the oil marketing companies omcs are incurring massive losses due to under recoveries at various levels
4348802 there still are huge under recoveries on sale of domestic fuel i do not see how we can reduce retail prices when our companies continue to lose money our retail prices are pegged much lower than current international crude prices there is no scope for reduction in petrol and diesel prices as of now

4348804 a post espousing an approach to web design in which one aims to create an enduring artifact and so this blog endured static fixed and not updated for a couple of months thats not exactly the type of permanence i was shooting for
4348805 but we know that we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going well just wait and see how the game goes and go from there
4348806 i just hope that i bring a lot of big play ability
4348807 im working on just managing the offense and doing exactly what the coaches ask so hopefully im a quarterback that wins a lot of games in the end
4348808 were looking for him to play with great poise and confidence
4348809 really at the quarterback position you have to just run the offense make good decisions be smart with the ball and be accurate just what any quarterbacks supposed to do
4348810 hes played some great football thats what were looking for him to do on a consistent basis
4348811 it just depends on the pattern in this offense we have several different routes and some guys do things better than others and well call their number when that plays called
4348812 i got a lot of reps and got better as a football player that was my goal and hopefully as the preseason continues ill just continue to get better

4348815 in the next 10 years we will experience more change than in the 50 years before
4348816 some degree of hybridization will be evident in all vehicles produced in 2020 and beyond
4348817 energy storage is in the heart of the next generation of efforts for fuel economy
4348818 when ford is considering four cylinders for the f 150 and toyota is slowing down production quite frankly things are seriously out of whack
4348819 there was significant advancement from first generation to the second and you can expect significant advancement on the third prius
4348820 they have been trying to reduce the 3 000 to 5 000 premium for a hybrid
4348821 going to be in a rough patch for quite some time
4348822 with gradual improvements throughout 2009 and then steady progress as we get into 2010 as our economic fundamentals start to regain their sold footing
4348823 theres no more time outs the games on the line here we have to radically revamp our lineups our backs are against the walls
4348824 theyre just around the corner and frankly our industry is not ready for it
4348825 turbulence is always going to be a part of this business as this business reacts to the highs and lows of social political and economics trends
4348826 sometimes it feels like its a double barreled perfect storm

4348833 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4348834 its been a long road to get here and i really cant believe that just happened
4348835 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000

4348841 los hechos de violencia principalmente contra de los turistas son la principal causa de estas advertencias
4348842 es evidente que rep blica dominicana no es ya el para so del todo incluido la isla oferta hoy un producto hotelero que en los ltimos a os ha pasado de ser muy bueno a excelente y de excelente a lujoso
4348843 una oferta que se complementa con atractivos adicionales como las rutas ecol gicas o la existencia de siete aeropuertos internacionales
4348844 en la actualidad no obstante se impone tanto consolidar los nuevos destinos que han surgido como potenciar aquellos polos que tienen posibilidades inmediatas de xito como es el caso de cap cana macao miches cabarete playa grande cabrera y saman
4348845 para hacer frente a esta situaci n hay que logar una integraci n total entre gobierno y empresarios crear una agenda nica intereses comunes que garanticen la inversi n nacional y extranjera en el sector tur stico
4348846 la idea es pues vender la marca m s conocida que es el caribe para posteriormente competir por el turista que llega a nuestra regi n
4348847 at the end of many births the wise man comes to me realizing that all this is vasudeva
4348848 when in the waking and dream states there is as it were another then one can see the other then one can smell the other then one can speak to the other then one can hear the other then one can think of the other then one can touch the other then one can know the other
4348849 by one clod of clay all that is made of clay is known the modification being only a name arising from speech while the truth is that all is clay
4348850 for when there is duality as it were then one sees another one smells another one tastes another one speaks to another one hears another one thinks of another one touches another one knows another
4348851 this self is that which has been described as not this not this it is imperceptible for it is never perceived undecaying for it never decays unattached for it never attaches itself unfettered for it never feels pain and never suffers injury through what should one know the knower
4348852 thus you have the instruction given to you this much indeed is the means to immortality
4348853 to the seer all things have verily become the self what delusion what sorrow can there be for him who beholds that oneness
4348854 in this there is but a single one pointed determination
4348855 when a man completely casts off o arjuna all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the self by the self then is he said to be one of steady wisdom

4348880 we need not say whether war does good or harm but only that we have discovered its origin in desires which are the most fruitful source of evils both to individuals and to states we agreed that no one man can practice many trades or arts satisfactorily well is not the conduct of war an art quite as important as shoemaking
4348881 but we would not allow our shoemaker to try to be also a farmer or weaver or builder because we wanted our shoes well made we gave each man on trade for which he was naturally fitted he would do good work if he confined himself to that all his life never letting the right moment slip by now in no form of work is efficiency so important as in war and fighting is not so easy a business that man can follow another trade such as farming or shoemaking and also be an efficient soldier why even a game like draughts or dice must be studied from childhood no one can become a fine player in his spare moments just taking up a shield or other weapon will not make a man capable of fighting that very day in any sort of warfare any more than taking up a tool or implement of some kind will make a man a craftsman or an athlete if he does not understand its use and has never been properly trained to handle it
4348882 men and women will take the field together and moreover bring with them the children who are sturdy enough to learn this trade like any other by watching what they will have to do themselves when they are grown up and besides looking on they will fetch and carry for their fathers and mothers and see to all their needs in time of war you must have noticed in the potter s trade for example the children watch their fathers and wait on them long before they may touch the wheel ought our guardians to be less careful to train theirs by letting them look on and become familiar with their duties and is it of no importance that men who are to be warriors should see something of war in childhood is that not worth some danger

4348989 i always start wondering at this point if were going to have waves for the event as far as 07 goes im glad its over ive grown in so many areas of my surfing and im really looking to apply myself full on in 2008
4348990 i think that domestically all the guys that that normally compete will be here as well as an influx of more international and domestic surfers because of the upgraded rating
4348991 im just really excited to defend my title and be around all my friends and crew that i dont get to see that much having grown up surfing sebastian local knowledge is definitely a factor and the major threats will be guys like damien hobgood ben bourgeois and gabe kling
4348992 im just happy to redeem myself a bit and get a couple of good waves in heats
4348993 thats really what i didnt do in round 1 i think as long as i catch waves and have fun ill be right its just a matter of waiting for them
4348994 paddling into it it was actually a smaller wave and rochelle ballard didnt even look at it
4348995 i kind of looked down the line and thought that i was going to fit into it because im a massive human but somehow i managed to squeeze into it it just drained and it just opened and closed the whole way down the line and i managed to make my way out
4348996 i really didnt want to draw any of the asp womens world title contenders because i know how it feels to be in that position that barrel was amazing but this is probably the worst i have ever felt coming in after winning a heat sofia is a true champion and such a gracious person regardless of whether she is winning or losing
4348997 it was an incredible feeling being out in that heat
4348998 steph gilmore and i came onto the tour this year together as rookies and to be able to play a part in her asp womens world title victory is really special i look up to steph a lot and i looked at that heat like i got my best result and she won the world title
4348999 its been a bit crazy with all the awards and activities and stuff but it felt good to get back in the water
4349000 i guess i was a bit rusty at the beginning but i started gaining more and more confidence throughout the heat and felt pretty good by the end
4349001 it was a great heat to start out with as they both surf so well and its helped with my confidence
4349002 carissa moore has been surfing so well and i was a bit nervous at the beginning of the heat i think i meet carissa again in round 3 but a win out here today is a good start and im looking forward to surfing again in round 3
4349003 i was able to get the first wave out there and that made all the difference
4349004 it really takes the pressure off and lets you relax and surf through the rest of the heat super stoked to get through and looking forward to the next round
4349005 the wave really opened up for me and i just went out there and tried to kill it
4349006 i was just out there pretending like layne beachley and nicola atherton werent even there i was just doing my own thing and finding my own peaks and it really worked out well
4349007 at this point i am just taking things one at a time
4349008 ive had a good start but its a long season and i am just looking at the next heat trying to live in the moment
4349009 this mornings round 1 heat didnt go as well as i would have liked
4349010 i found myself paddling around a lot and not really getting the waves i needed i really focused on finding good waves in round 2 and i was able to get a couple of good scores under my belt

4349042 its unbelievable that somebody could have had a lengthy criminal record and that no one asked
4349043 the judge didnt know and yet that judge was then put in a position where she made a decision without having that information in front of her its unbelievable

4349049 well set down rules in september on how to take part in a trial carbon trading scheme and in october wed like to get started
4349050 japan should take the lead in building a low carbon society in advance to the rest of the world this is the first concrete step toward that
4349051 the next fiscal years budget is to be discussed later firstly by the ministries concerned we havent done any calculation yet
4349052 in general nobodys expecting a lot from this g8 theyd like to see something positive on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions come out of it but i dont theres too much expectation right now
4349053 i am not expecting a lot this early in the process ahead of the december 2009 copenhagen meeting where they are supposed to have a final agreement for post 2012
4349054 the us will play a big part in this and right now it appears the us will have to wait till after the elections to make some kind of meaningful input to these negotiations because we have a lame duck presidency
4349055 it doesnt make explicit who will be doing what to achieve that minus 50 and it doesnt tell you what the baseline for that minus 50 is

4349060 compared to other options an avoided deforestation program would be relatively cheap and practical for the united states
4349061 it would save american taxpayers money and provide a huge transfer of funding from one region of the world to another giving developing countries a larger chunk of the worlds economic pie to use as they see fit
4349062 the results indicate that substantial emission reductions could be accomplished through 2030 the period we examined
4349063 if this kind of program could stop deforestation it would provide a bigger source of biodiversity by retaining a larger stock of tropical forest keep carbon out of the atmosphere and provide money to people in developing countries to pursue new forms of livelihood that dont involve cutting down trees
4349064 there is a global benefit for maintaining forests but nobody is paying for it
4349065 developing countries would like to be compensated for the economic benefits they forgo by preserving their forests
4349066 it just didnt pick up any steam at that time
4349067 there were lots of constraints within the kyoto treaty about using land use options to abate carbon emissions it looks like there is a large effort now to try to relax some of those constraints in order to allow avoided deforestation to be considered as a carbon abatement mechanism
4349068 it would provide a bigger source of biodiversity by retaining a larger stock of tropical forest keep carbon out of the atmosphere and provide money to people in developing countries to pursue new forms of livelihood that dont involve cutting down trees
4349069 now there is a huge debate about it and our paper is just trying to add one economic component to the discussion
4349070 if were talking about the source of at least 20 percent of the worlds emissions that can be cheaply abated then why wouldnt we do it
4349071 if we dont spend the money to offer these countries development assistance theyre going to continue deforesting so their emissions are just going to continue
4349072 we are environmentalists the kind of customers of a typical carbon offset company
4349073 but we found that although most offsets seemed environmentally sound the market as a whole seemed really complex and difficult to evaluate
4349074 it struck us that the eua retirement process was one that could address all these problems
4349075 if the price rises in that time we lose money but if it drops significantly we use any windfall profits to retire more euas the 10 percent mark up is all we keep
4349076 had we launched this in phase 1 any euas sold would have been environmentally worthless
4349077 we have a fairly high degree of confidence that phase 2 will be short and with every eua we retire were helping to make it even shorter
4349078 if euas get a lot more expensive it obviously makes it a more difficult sell for us particularly to our corporate clients
4349079 if you look at our business model its evident that were never going to make millions out of this this is predominantly an environmentally motivated project
4349080 well to be honest with you if they would have done something this year i would have thought it was bogus anyway because you dont change global warming and you dont really have an effect by doing something six months before you leave office
4349081 it doesnt sound to me believable at all the sincerity is not there
4349082 i think that the way they have done it is much better because it just really means basically this administration did not believe in global warming or they did not believe that they should do anything about it since china is not doing anything about it and since india is not willing to do the same thing so why should we do the same thing
4349083 we want to offer something to companies that cant go fully carbon neutral but want a credible approach
4349084 this helps them step by step to get to 100 neutrality
4349085 the statement that the label indicates the level of carbon neutrality of the entire business suggests that they are looking at full life cycle emissions which is a good thing
4349086 in the early 70s when gun control was the issue and people were yelling like you guys are about
4349087 the potential size and scope of a structured carbon emissions market in the us is unequivocally vast it is certainly possible that the emissions markets could overtake all other commodity markets
4349088 even with conservative assumptions this could be a 2 000bn futures market in relatively short order
4349089 its easier to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission
4349090 mama ahh paint mama ahh paint ahh hold ju ahh mama a hold ju

4349095 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region
4349096 there is not a clash of civilizations but its a clash of ignorance that all sides need to work on
4349097 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4349098 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4349099 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4349100 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4349101 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4349102 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4349103 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4349104 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4349105 since linux is basically free the additional cost of this feature is minimal probably a dollar this is the single biggest threat to microsoft since the company went public its a bigger threat than google thats for sure its not overt its insidious

4349138 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya al qur an pada malam kemuliaan dan tahukah kamu apakah malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dari seribu bulan pada malam itu turun malaikat malaikat dan malaikat jibril dengan izin tuhannya untuk mengatur segala urusan malam itu penuh kesejahteraan sampai terbit fajar
4349139 carilah lailatul qadr di malam ganjil pada 10 hari terakhir bulan ramadhan
4349140 carilah di sepuluh hari terakhir jika salah seorang di antara kalian tidak mampu atau lemah maka jangan sampai terluput dari tujuh hari sisanya
4349141 aku keluar untuk mengkhabarkan kepada kalian tentang lailatul qadr tetapi fulan dan fulan berdebat hingga diangkat tidak bisa lagi diketahui kapan kepastian lailatul qadr terjadi semoga ini lebih baik bagi kalian maka carilah pada malam 29 27 dan 25

4349143 ya allah sesungguhnya engkau maha pengampun dan mencintai orang yang meminta ampunan maka ampunilah aku
4349144 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila masuk pada sepuluh hari terakhir bulan ramadhan beliau menghidupkan malamnya membangunkan keluarganya dan bersungguh sungguh serta mengencangkan kainnya yaitu menjauhi istri istrinya untuk konsentrasi beribadah dan mencari lailatul qadr
4349145 pagi hari malam lailatul qadr matahari terbit tidak ada sinar yang menyilaukan seperti bejana hingga meninggi
4349146 malam lailatul qadr adalah malam yang indah cerah tidak panas dan tidak juga dingin dan keesokan harinya sinar mataharinya melemah kemerah merahan
4349147 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan zakat fithri pada bulan ramadhan kepada manusia
4349148 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan zakat fithri sebanyak satu sha kurma atau satu sha gandum atas setiap orang merdeka atau budak laki laki atau perempuan anak kecil atau besar dari kalangan kaum muslimin
4349149 kami mengeluarkan zakat fithri pada zaman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam satu sha makanan satu sha gandum satu sha kurma satu sha susu kering dan satu sha anggur kering
4349150 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan satu sha gandum satu sha kurma dan satu sha salt

4349152 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mewajibkan zakat fithri sebagai pembersih diri bagi yang berpuasa dari perbuatan sia sia dan perbuatan kotor serta sebagai makanan bagi orang orang miskin
4349153 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menugaskan kepadaku agar menjaga zakat ramadhan
4349154 barangsiapa yang menunaikan zakatnya sebelum shalat maka dia adalah zakat yang diterima dan barangsiapa yang menunaikannya setelah shalat maka dia adalah merupakan suatu shadaqah dari beberapa shadaqah yang ada
4349155 barangsiapa yang shalat di masjidku masjid nabawi sebanyak empat puluh 40 shalat tanpa ada satu pun yang terlewati maka ditetapkan baginya bebas dari an naar selamat dari adzab dan terlepas dari nifaq
4349156 this was probably the best thing that could have happened to those people because it really was a family
4349157 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4349158 they believed that this place was the entrance to xibalba that is why we have found the offerings there
4349159 it is very likely this area was protected as a sacred depository for the dead or for the passage of their souls
4349160 these sacred tunnels and caves were natural temples and annexes to temples on the surface
4349161 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4349162 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4349163 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4349164 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4349165 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood
4349166 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4349167 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4349168 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4349169 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4349170 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4349171 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4349172 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4349173 the united states stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia
4349174 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4349175 i was thinking oh my goodness i can see it now the chinese accused of harsh and brutal tactics against human rights protesters show that they serve kfc and tea to their prisoners they wanted to document our treatment
4349176 just as in other countries assemblies processions and demonstrations must be held according to relevant legal regulations and procedures and shall not be carried out without approval from relevant authorities
4349177 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4349178 the campaign did not pledge any federal matching funds certifications as collateral for a bank loan
4349179 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4349180 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4349181 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4349182 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on
4349183 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4349184 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4349185 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
4349186 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4349187 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4349188 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4349189 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4349190 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4349191 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4349192 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4349193 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4349194 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4349195 do you really think it would have been a good idea if he had wielded the power to shut our opinions up on the web
4349196 if he voted against fisa you would be here arguing that he doesnt care about our nations safety
4349197 then i consider the alternative mccain obama is my choice by far
4349198 hey maybe this guy doesnt support this and this but he sure is right about that and that
4349199 were already working with event organizers to expand the program for doors open denver 2009
4349200 we love our denver tours but its been fun to offer unique audio services to museums convention groups and art galleries we hope to line up more projects like travelhost in the future that would help grow the business

4349208 most credit companies charge high late fees to the tune of 35 to 39 per late payment so a smart credit card user has to be careful to avoid this trap sneaky credit card trick 4 convenience checks
4349209 during the holiday season when our card balances are usually high credit card companies often send offers which invite us to skip a payment
4349210 to boost their profits credit card companies often lure their clients by sending lucrative offers with lower minimum payments on debts the lowered minimum payments can be as low as 2 of our owed balance
4349211 cash is king when its not a debt but has been accumulated as a result of our savings and like convenience checks cash advances from our credit card accounts is a terrible mistake we should avoid it at all costs
4349212 it is a known fact that credit card companies attract new clients by advertising low
4349213 aprs newbies might think that aprs on their balances are fixed till they pay it off right no dear we are nowhere near the truth sneaky credit card trick 9 0 apr take care with the fine print

4349230 no quite true i assure you times funny like that isnt it this is your first no second time meeting me but this is not my first time meeting you
4349231 we meet somewhere around the beginning of the twentieth century in a manner of speaking and our courtship spans the centuries
4349232 i travel in time as well but a little differently
4349233 all that you see this entire village from the twentieth century to the fiftieth is under my control i have been manipulating events from the tiniest prattle to cataclysmic chaos to yield the most energy there are no wars no unnecessary deaths no great stress merely pure and idyllic life pumping out cheap dependable energy by the boatload a simple hard light holographic matrix keeps the very fabric of space and time in my hands to play with like putty ensuring not only a comfortable life for those in the year five billion but a comfortable life for some of the nicest people to have ever lived

4349235 what did they used to call it back in the old days ah yes its a win win situation
4349236 but i like to think of myself as the moderator
4349237 im going to assume that you are the time pilot in this situation
4349238 and judging by your surly expression i take it you do not approve of my little operation here
4349239 the only thing i approve of is your attention to detail and passion for perfection
4349240 however one does not congratulate a murder on his method of killing
4349241 you are in possession of illegal reality tampering technology and as such are in violation of the preservation of space and time
4349242 preservation you speak of preservation and liken me to a murderer you are the murderers you allow for millions to die in war millions more from disease and heartbreak and depression and suicide and hatred you allow this for the sake of your beautiful preservation
4349243 there is an order to things and all things must pass your timetrap although efficient and effective is wrong
4349244 is that the best you have its wrong dont make me laugh as if i would be stupid enough to abuse this technology and incur the punishment of reapers i monitor the situation constantly
4349245 and when the risk is too great i will cancel it but for now i give these people paradise
4349246 you give them an illusion a life that is impossible a perfection that humans cannot understand you make them live a thousand lives you give them so much perfection that they become sick of it you make their lives so good they pray for it to be bad but youll never hear their prayers vicar because you simply warp reality into what you believe is right

4349252 now mr urbina what do you say of my dogma hm my thoughts on preservation hm my thoughts on murder
4349253 you know dont you fiftieth century of course you do you know how many ive killed and you probably know how many more i will kill but most of all
4349254 you know that there is nothing you can do to stop it
4349255 it must happen mr urbina this dream cannot be sustained
4349256 you dont think i would have done the same javis put my home away in a little pocket before it was destroyed played in the dollhouse like an idiot only a fool dreams of what he cannot have and only an idiot risks destroying time and space to do it

4349267 our immune systems and only our immune systems prevent us from becoming everyone else all at once we are who we are only because we defend ourselves every moment of every day and who we are is everything we are pieces of others portraits painted somewhere between our brains and thymuses we are the dirt weve eaten and the songs weve sung we are the light of the stars and darknesses old beyond imagining we are at once spontaneous fires and sacred water we are faith and forgiveness we are our own deaths and we are the eternal thought of others

4349276 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4349278 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4349279 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer

4349287 love come so easy as a child thats why there so sweet
4349288 beginning a question with whom in contemporary standard english would not just be unusual it would be bizarre
4349289 insisting on whom as some people still do when writing for print is more and more looking like an affectation
4349290 this could not be a prouder moment for him and i

4349297 we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a de facto world test cricket championship bout between australian and south africa during december and january
4349298 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league twenty20 will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered
4349299 fox news is a response to the overwhelming liberal media bias
4349300 if we could play a week earlier for us that would be the best i dont know if that can be arranged
4349301 in terms of having that hectic schedule a break would be really beneficial for us
4349302 at 36ers training im usually going up against coops jacob holmes and balls adam ballinger
4349303 he told me i had the talent and ability and got me working on my fitness
4349304 as soon as lugo begins to change things the attacks will start but thank god we have the support of our people new winds are blowing in latin america which is truly living a new era
4349305 weve been fighting very hard day and night for four days but after today the water level should recede
4349306 there are eight million stories in the naked utility this has been one of them
4349307 there is only one pretty child in the world and every mother has it
4349308 there have been plenty of rumours and if they are only half true then id expect to be contacted
4349309 we have established a good group and hopefully will be able to retain the bulk of those players we will listen to any player who wants to join our program
4349310 i feel for the girls madison is stressed wondering if she is going to get picked up
4349311 i have told madison she has to go to the world youth cup it is a great experience but why would a club pay for these girls if they are available for only half a season
4349312 what about caitlin bassett at the west coast fever she could be earning 40 or 50 000 dollars but may have to miss out on the money because of the under age championships i have spoken to the anpa and they have had discussions with netball australia

4349318 comic con has zero tolerance for harassment or violence against any of our attendees or exhibitors please report instances to a security guard or the con office in room xxx
4349319 la faa cree que la cantidad grande de la multa por estas violaciones es adecuada porque american airlines estaba al tanto de que se requer an reparaciones y en lugar de ello demor el mantenimiento

4349323 bad debts as a portion of total loans went from 0 14 last year to
4349324 coming into camp we talked about him as a returner that a lot of people thought could play receiver
4349325 now i think its safe to say that hes a receiver hes doing all the things that weve asked him to do i still make the same statement i think he can be a 1 or 2 type receiver in the league hes dangerous when he has his hands on the football and were excited about getting his hands on the ball in a lot of different ways
4349326 i dont know how the seasons going to go as far as the reps on offense and the return game
4349327 so i have to prepare myself to go a full game the return game and offense i just worked harder
4349328 why would i come to work if i didnt expect to be dominant
4349329 i dont expect us to be at the bottom like we were last year so we have a new year a new slate and lets see the outcome
4349330 if this unit is healthy how far we can go i think the skys the limit
4349331 im actually kind of excited because now im in first class
4349332 its going to be rough for some of the younger guys because theyre going to be three to a seat but im going to enjoy this trip
4349333 im going on year 6 now so youre definitely pulling the vet card out
4349334 fortes gonna get three to a seat but it aint gonna be long before hes going to be up in first class in a year or two
4349335 we need to globalize our business provide even more opportunities for our customers to interact with us online knock down the barriers to those who find the learning curve of our games too steep and discover new areas in sports and health and wellness in which our brand can truly make a difference
4349336 dont try to change people take them for who they are
4349337 in school we are always goofing around and talking like that
4349338 everyone has learned to do the waltz everyone has learned to do the tango
4349339 when i went to brazil i taught the people to garden
4349340 they had plenty of meat and rice and dairy products but no vegetables
4349341 i am honored and happy about the distinction but the truth is im apprehensive about being in the public eye
4349342 i have some experience though because on the fourth of july i was marshal of the hoffman estates parade and was amazed at how many people are on the sidelines i am overwhelmed to be honored by both villages
4349343 for this year only the parade will travel north on summit drive from hartford drive to stock port lane
4349344 it would be considerate for people to reserve just the space they need because we expect record crowds at this free event
4349345 i promise to smile and wave to the folks on both sides of the street
4349346 we do this for the love of the music to give pleasure to others
4349347 if i ever hear songs like close to you ill just die
4349348 when they asked what music i listened to i would say classical
4349349 in those days rock and roll was not the norm among surgeons
4349350 we all have vocations while we wish this was our vocation
4349351 people can remember what year they saw the band based on adams height
4349352 that is what you do to give back for the gift of music
4349353 i am surprised that it has clearly clearly made my relationships closer with my patients
4349354 we live by the motto when it stops being fun i quit so far it hasnt stopped being fun
4349355 even when it rained halfway through we knew this was something that could be successful and become a family friendly event that everyone loves
4349356 if you have an established event that offers the same things every year thats great
4349357 but we are new and we want to see where we can go and what we can do
4349358 in corporate terms he was the equivalent of the chief financial officer
4349359 he was a wizard at using the old adding machine he would work the machine with his right hand and hed be turning the checks he was adding up with his left hand and he would talk to you at the same time
4349360 he put in a budget system that made for a more mature financial operation and he was a wonderful brother to live with he always had a kind word and he remained interested in events up until the end
4349361 i know everything and im going to teach you everything
4349362 hold it a minute were going to do things differently
4349363 this is a 40 foot outdoor bar the only outdoor bar in st charles
4349364 we will have sandwiches and entrees steak seafood and pasta
4349365 the main thing is that everything is made to order
4349366 im really pleased with the place and the way it has turned out
4349367 they got some old photos of rays and its patrons and they have them hanging on the walls so that was nice
4349368 john had always hoped that someday we could do something like this to rays
4349369 if john was still around hed be pretty pleased with this
4349370 he came at me with a gun i was like what are you doing i pushed him it went off i freaked out i didnt know what to do
4349371 a cook county department of highways road improvement project coming soon
4349372 putting your tax dollars to work todd h stroger president board of county commissioners
4349373 the question is what purpose does it serve does the road get fixed better
4349374 its nothing but advertising for the county board president at some point therell be a new president and all the signs will have to be switched over its just goofy
4349375 the president has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining county roads
4349376 theres basically a fundamental misunderstanding about where the taxpayers funds are going
4349377 if we criticize him we have to criticize the other guys too
4349378 its not for promotion its letting you know whose office it is
4349379 clearly the irony alert wasnt on when they were drawing these things up
4349380 the passenger door was still able to open amazingly but the drivers side sustained a lot of damage
4349381 typically in an offset collision drivers sides get hit the worst
4349382 he has been following the board and we liked his experience
4349383 we liked what heide can contribute to the board moving forward
4349384 ive still got all those signs in my basement and you can only make so many yard sale signs with them so yes i would run again
4349385 i believe we need to assess where were at and where we want to be in five 10 15 20 years and develop a road map to get there so that were good stewards for the future generations of napervillians
4349386 and good judgment comes from having the ability to look at issues through the eyes of your constituents
4349387 each of them was passionate and has demonstrated how much they care about the park district and that was awesome to see
4349388 i hope they all try again because each of them would be valuable to us
4349389 el chapo guzman and the juarez cartel led by vicente carrillo fuentes
4349390 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4349391 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4349392 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4349393 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4349394 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4349395 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4349396 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4349397 i will carry this with me for the rest of my life
4349398 he looked me in the eye and told me he was sorry
4349399 were right now in the process of going in and putting angled steel reinforcement and making alternate connections there
4349400 the original contractor on the job has not been responding to letters from our attorney
4349401 he is not going to be reimbursing for the search firm
4349402 we do expect that were going to be able to build on that same process we had its not like we have to start all over because we did do a search to hire betts and found numerous qualified candidates so they can still avail themselves to the process
4349403 the agreement recognizes that daniel is going to pursue other opportunities and the board is going to go in another direction
4349404 it is standard operating procedure for this district to examine what is on the computers that belong to the district
4349405 there was certainly nothing unlawful that was shown by any examination of any computer that mr betts touched
4349406 swim against the current even a dead fish can go with the flow
4349407 get well and stay well while you are in the hospital
4349408 we really wanted to expand our services to the north side of the park
4349409 we just want to provide a nice space for people to come enjoy a good meal and enjoy their day at cantigny
4349410 i like real flowers theres too much plastic stuff around our world anyway i think they add to the beauty of a city i think summers a good time for flowers
4349411 write about any issue surrounding the world of journalism especially as it relates to editing in all its forms
4349412 view the posts comments there you will have the option to edit or delete them
4349413 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4349414 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4349415 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4349416 theres an opportunity to really improve our product by doing something along these lines
4349417 must encourage more students to take advanced placement courses so they are better prepared for postsecondary education and training
4349418 this is a great opportunity to get a free sampling of classes without the enrollment process
4349419 we have record high debt unpaid bills fiscal mismanagement federal investigations
4349420 in six years we have accomplished a number of things that help people from investing a record amount of money toward education to making sure uninsured women can get mammograms and pap smears to raising the minimum wage twice to giving children health insurance and we have done all that without raising taxes the governor doesnt mind if he has to get beat up or bruised on behalf of the people because its provided results
4349421 this is really the first green bank that weve done
4349422 if nothing else its jobs and its industry for the village
4349423 heres a step in the right direction hopefully other businesses will catch on to this as well
4349424 the certification process is a way for somebody outside to come in and make sure what we promised to do is being delivered
4349425 we dont like to have to raise the lunch cost
4349426 but we would have to be putting a lot of money out
4349427 when they said the price is going to go up i thought it would be more than this
4349428 we had some things from the house in storage and a little apartment but we basically were just starting from scratch all over again
4349429 were hosting this because we want to and its our passion
4349430 its not just a bike run its a gathering of people who are stepping up to the plate to do the right thing once you meet these veterans theres no turning back they just steal your heart
4349431 my children and family situation is such now that my kids are older and ill have the time for a couple of years to travel throughout illinois but i want to wait and see how this fall goes for the republican party and see who else comes forward
4349432 were having a lot of phone calls about getting students home a little earlier but its not going to make it easier to get those kids home a little sooner with fewer buses on the roads fewer drivers more stops to make and the cost of fuel going up
4349433 theres pretty widespread agreement among the superintendents throughout the state that this is the worst its been in recent memory
4349434 it means it will take us longer to reduce our deficit than we originally planned
4349435 we are moving to a four day workweek which will enable us to cut out most utility costs for 20 percent of the time we are normally operational
4349436 i was thinking oh my goodness i can see it now the chinese accused of harsh and brutal tactics against human rights protesters show that they serve kfc and tea to their prisoners they wanted to document our treatment
4349437 just as in other countries assemblies processions and demonstrations must be held according to relevant legal regulations and procedures and shall not be carried out without approval from relevant authorities
4349438 words were exchanged between the two groups and a fight ensued between the two groups
4349439 we were unable to charge other people because we were unable to get positive identifications from the victims in a lineup
4349440 theres still one more person we believe was involved that were looking for
4349441 did you see what i did dad didja see didja see
4349442 principals with one copy machine in their building are very frustrated
4349443 i dont know how the little kids carry those backpacks
4349444 the idea of being more paperless has escaped us in education
4349445 if you watch this movie we want you to think about what youre laughing at its not funny
4349446 we are viewing this as the educational opportunity that it is
4349447 since his speech i havent used the word as much
4349448 a few people have said to me dont use that word
4349449 a lot of it is ignorance more than malice they dont know how much it hurts people with intellectual disabilities
4349450 theres no recognition that its very harmful to a significant amount of the population as many as 3 percent of the population has some type of intellectual disability
4349451 calling something a satire is not a get out of jail free card
4349452 at that moment he activated his lights the motorcycle went at an extremely high rate of speed and the officer lost sight of it
4349453 it would create some real delays for three or four elementary schools
4349454 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
4349455 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
4349456 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
4349457 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
4349458 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk
4349459 its as close to kabul as logar and thats of a concern to us
4349460 and the seed that fell in the weeds well these are the ones who hear but then the seed is crowded out and nothing comes of it as they go about their lives worrying about tomorrow making money and having fun

4349464 solicitamos un cuarto intermedio hasta el pr ximo martes a las 13
4349465 present un plan de recuperaci n de d as y nosotros hicimos lo propio
4349466 consideramos que la propuesta del sindicato es inviable y ellos sostienen que el nuestro tambi n lo es
4349467 as que queremos un par de d as para analizarlo bien
4349468 el sutef pidi la suspensi n de los descuentos de julio pero nosotros lo rechazamos esta es la definici n por el momento pero vamos a evaluar bien la propuesta gremial
4349469 proponen la readecuaci n del calendario escolar corriendo algunos d as las fechas tomando algunos d as de jornada y algunos feriados como el 21 de septiembre para dar clase
4349470 pero nosotros queremos analizar si con eso realmente se recuperan los d as perdidos
4349471 en funci n de las conclusiones se determinar si se suspenden o no los descuentos
4349472 por ahora no se acept la petici n de suspender los descuentos salariales por los paros
4349473 en lo que avanzamos fue en acordar el aumento salarial cuyo reclamo motiv los paros pero si el sutef pretende que la suspensi n de los descuentos formen parte del paquete va a ser muy dif cil homologarlo
4349474 ladies and gentlemen i present to you mr and mrs
4349475 you deliberately chose to drive when you must have known that you could not drive safely consequently you killed two innocent people and devastated their family and friends
4349476 it wasnt what we wanted obviously but it still isnt going to bring our mum and dad back
4349477 we needed this to get some closure and start moving on with our lives
4349478 think of the families that you affect not yourself but all the loved ones that get hurt
4349479 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4349480 csr advises shareholders to beware of any unsolicited offer they may receive it said

4349482 s claro que vamos a tocar temas diferentes pero no s lo de black sabbath sino tambi n de lo nuevo de heaven and hell
4349483 s empezamos tocando conciertos m s largos pero tuvimos que recortarlo en un par de shows que ten amos menos tiempo

4349485 despu s de que yo dejara el grupo para tocar con ozzy risas no estuvo bien y finalmente hemos tenido la oportunidad de conducir el mismo coche juntos habl ndolo todo y ahora s lo hay agua sobre el puente hay que mirar adelante las cosas pasan y ya est pero ahora mismo hay realmente muy buen rollo entre todos los miembros del grupo una relaci n y un ambiente muy agradable
4349486 ya tenemos m s o menos seis canciones escritas aunque todav a son s lo demos pero suenan incre bles son pesadas imponentes suenan realmente a sabbath
4349487 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
4349488 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
4349489 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
4349490 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4349491 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4349492 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4349493 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4349494 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4349495 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4349496 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4349497 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4349498 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4349499 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4349500 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4349501 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4349514 they really think that because theyre young that they could survive anything that young people dont die in hospitals its only old people that die in hospital even if youre in an accident
4349515 they really believe because of their age and agility that that makes up for lack of experience that their reflexes are faster and theyre stronger physically
4349516 and so they believe theyre better drivers in fact than older people who have a lot more experience
4349517 it shows them first hand that this too could happen to you
4349518 with all the work that weve done with teens this is really reinforcing what they tell us anecdotally
4349519 they do have a feeling that theyre invincible its always someone else whos the bad driver not them and its really difficult to get them to understand the consequences of bad choices
4349520 you cant just have a program for the teens you cant just show it to them once
4349521 but when you look at it very carefully its usually not bad luck its usually someone has made a bad choice someone has chosen to drink and drive chosen not to wear seatbelts or to speed or be out on a lake at midnight when theres no light
4349522 so its never just one person who loses their life its the whole family losing a child losing a loved one losing a parent it is tragic and it shakes the whole family and they never ever recover
4349523 everybody is talented original and has something important to say
4349524 hes the reason the times are so much faster these olympics than in the last olympics
4349525 times that were winning medals in athens arent even making finals here
4349526 its everyone chasing michael now which makes his feat that much greater
4349527 the quest to have more medals than spitz will be something very important and hes keeping the attention of the public
4349528 im against the lottery but if one of my members won the lottery i wish and i hope he would give 10 to the church we could do a lot of things with that money
4349529 we are in the process now of building a youth center and you would be surprised at the people that can be helped with 600 000
4349530 anything extra is bonus so that would be an extra blessing of offering after that so if i did win lotto sweepstakes i would tithe to my church
4349531 beritahukan kepada semua rekan2 sahabat keluarga anda supaya tidak sampai tereleminasi
4349532 all he ever seems to do is call pointless meetings wander about the office shooting us with twin pistol fingers and invent annoying tasks and pedantic processes for us to grind through
4349533 according to what i was taught business should automatically weed out imbiciles and morons for demotion to jizz mopping but stevie just goes from strength to strength it makes me sick every sunday i sit with my head in my hands moaning incoherently at the prospect of another working week
4349534 three days before our deadline he decided for no good reason that we needed to go back through the last four weeks sales and draft tps reports for each one
4349535 it meant twenty hours of overtime for each of us and when somebody told him the reports werent useful stevie just told him that theres no i in team then went home for the weekend
4349536 orthodox rules of self interest should mean that the company would set such horrible assholes to work licking the toilets clean but they just gave him stock options god i just want it all to end
4349537 in times like this we need men with stevies talents

4349540 these consumer storage products havent gained sufficient traction in the marketplace or the monetization levels necessary to offset the high cost of their operation
4349541 will sunset mymobile next year in order to focus on our core revenue producing products ie mail messaging portal and mapping
4349542 deliver a higher value product inside of the aol programming channels
4349543 there was a time at aol when the strengths of our aggregate portfolio of products more than compensated for the weakness of an underperforming product the realities of the industry and market shifts in online advertising no longer make that possible simply put every product makes a direct impact on our bottom line with two quarters behind us it is fair to say that results across the aol products team have been mixed
4349544 hi teams ive spoken to your respective leads about some budget concerns but wanted to pass along one more last minute and unfortunate effort we must halt any new posting on the blogs through next thursday july 31 there may be some exceptions and not all blogs will be paused in the same manner see below more after the jump the goal is to safeguard against further budget overages thus protecting our business and hopefully continuing as usual though maybe a little restrained in august going forward we will remain slightly leaner but myhope is that by the end of the year well continue to ramp up as we have historically you may see posts get rescheduled to account for the change and if you have larger features those should not be published until august sorry about that and very sorry about the unintended shortfall of income for all of you again the long view is to return to normal as we re align with our original budget estimates im here all day for questions and concerns on this lists or off again i know this is difficult and will cause some worry as of now the only blog to be put on hiatus after this month is diy life effective august 1 diy life could be resurrected at some point but that is out of my hands everyone else should make plans for a resumption in a week dls bloggers should immediately press pause on new content tuaw can continue with 1 or 2 app store posts a day thanks in advance everyone well get through this an emerge stronger i know it
4349545 youll need lots of capital talent luck and financial discipline to see your project through
4349546 but i must say it is easy creating a new corporate community and economic boom that will benefit those around us greatly many times start up companies tend to become burdens to the general public beacuse they fold or otherwise go under but companies like mine mitigate that risk and show profits right away this means less foreclosures and higher credit limits for businesspeople like me who are looking to the future of the online casinos industry
4349547 ive always wanted to start my own online casinos company through the internet
4349548 and now i can because of new government grants for internet start ups
4349549 we got start up capital from family friends and a few bank loans
4349550 and then slowly paid each respective party off one at a time this took about five years to do but all debts were satisfied with full repayment and some extra for interest
4349551 because many see them as rough investment forecasts or as prospectuses for local companies as a result there is a big scramble to get this info and buy into local online casinos businesses right away before market prices exceed a reasonable investment amount
4349552 i thought id be answering phone calls from creditors and writing order forms out by hand now that we see the potential of the online casinos consumer market weve immediately hired new staff to meet the high demands of this market
4349553 how in this good green earth am i going to make the two sides even
4349554 we love him not only because he is so handsome but because he represents the pride of china
4349555 take your hands away from my dearest brother you cop
4349556 they praised him for his 360 degree handsome look well built body in perfect proportion refined and exemplary postures smile and courtesy to torch bearers his pals and audience and determination to safeguard the olympic spirit
4349557 in torch relay pictures he stayed calm and confident during violent situations and gracious graceful and proud in most others those other stars or idols lacking an unpolluted and vigorous temperament are not attractive any longer
4349558 my dear second brother on the right please marry me

4349562 e merito loro se sono qui di pap innanzi tutto che mi ha trasmesso la passione portandomi a tirare quando avevo solo quattordici anni e poi di chi sopporta le mie assenze e di chi mi ha aiutato economicamente di mio marito perch il nostro sport costa
4349563 anche per questo mi associo alla richiesta di detassare i nostri premi
4349564 ora voglio arrivare almeno fino a londra 2012 per difendere il mio titolo
4349565 e non credo sia giusto associare il fucile ai maschi il nostro uno sport senza sesso va bene anche per le donne e per le giovanissime
4349566 non giusto criminalizzare il nostro sport uno dei pi sicuri in assoluto lo consigliamo ai ragazzi perch il tiro a volo insegna a stare insieme agli altri e migliora il controllo di se stessi
4349567 john said that you will not succeed in being acquitted regardless of what youve been told
4349568 your options unfortunately are life imprisonment or execution by lethal injection
4349569 i know that you wont be able to make it but i had to mention that you had at least been invited
4349570 people have always misunderstood me but i also did make a lot of mistakes
4349571 i dont always understand things from others points of view thats how i got here
4349572 oh its just a little something i picked up at auction

4349575 hudson has pretty good control lets put it that way
4349576 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4349577 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4349578 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4349579 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4349580 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4349581 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4349582 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4349583 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4349584 entitled to it amp have to have it to get by
4349585 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4349586 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4349587 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4349588 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4349589 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4349590 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4349591 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4349592 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4349593 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4349594 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4349595 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4349596 were not calling it a suspicious death a homicide or a suicide
4349597 how come nobody in the hotel noticed that he wasnt coming or going
4349598 everyone will be upset and will want to know what happened
4349599 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4349600 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4349601 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4349602 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4349603 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to
4349604 i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well
4349605 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4349606 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4349607 these people go out on the trail and dont know the area they dont know the geography of it
4349608 its just horrible i cant imagine what the parents must be feeling
4349609 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4349610 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4349611 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4349612 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4349613 daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4349614 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4349615 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4349616 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4349617 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4349618 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4349619 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4349620 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4349621 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4349622 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4349623 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4349624 i dont think anyone should get in the way of what i want im not going to feel bad if i go out and race my heart out and end up winning
4349625 the most important thing is being able to separate the two races and just most on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me is the psychological part
4349626 he just loves to get in and race the best and that pushes michael and that pushes aaron peirsol
4349627 i think aaron and michael both know that hes a threat when hes on and i think those are going to be two very exciting races to watch
4349628 thats a swim to get me into the meet a little bit
4349629 its been a long week waiting and watching a lot of ups and downs finally im in the meet and i can relax and do my race a little bit better
4349630 i didnt have much speed the first 50 but i think i came home pretty good i just need to put myself out there a little more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4349631 ill just try to set myself up for a good final and go from there
4349632 the resulting figure of 0 842733801 shows that in general there is a strong relationship between news websites linking out and getting links in return
4349633 she was just standing in the driveway rocking the newborn who was still attached to the placenta
4349634 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
4349635 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4349636 weve had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems
4349637 when you come home from work everything drains away from you because its so quiet and peaceful
4349638 now we are going to have to listen to those windmills whoosh whoosh whoosh
4349639 until the ioc does something about the womens gymnastics team from china breaking the age rule i am done watching anything i believe more than one of their participants was under the age of 16 what a bunch of deceitful cheaters and liars they are proving themselves to be
4349640 they have the oldest culture in the world blah blah blah
4349641 there is nothing more valuable than the guidance a professional can give a budding animator who is honing their craft this partnership really validates the unique teaching model animation mentor embodies and the powerful technology weve created to support an incredible learning experience no matter where you are on the planet
4349642 startpr is like a mailbox for blog posts now you can manage your pr like you do your mail
4349643 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4349644 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4349645 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4349646 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4349647 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4349648 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4349649 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4349650 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4349651 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4349652 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4349653 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4349654 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4349655 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4349656 then relax and enjoy the reassurance that you have extra credit available if and when you need it
4349657 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things
4349658 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing
4349659 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4349660 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase
4349661 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4349662 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything

4349665 i think the afl are up there checking it right now and well obviously have a look at it later on today
4349666 we wanted it to be suitable to play an afl game we will demand that
4349667 we had a lot of boys that were playing together for the first time in a long time
4349668 you would expect them to be a little bit rusty you would also expect them to be a little bit better this week
4349669 sammy rapira is getting that big right arm free and it is only a matter before mckinnon just steams onto one and runs under the posts
4349670 they have got a couple of big hard running centres
4349671 they kick well they will probably finish their sets well all the things that we try and do really
4349672 they have been one of the better sides all season and we lost to them last time they are coming into it with some good form the challenge is up to us
4349673 no one wants anyone from perth in any sport to win it
4349674 no one used to like it when we were successful in the old nsl so theyre going on what happened in the previous season
4349675 its a new start this season and everyone starts on zero points so they can go on all they want about sydney or anyone else its up to us every time we step onto the park to prove them wrong
4349676 weve spoken about what we want to achieve this year and our main goal our first goal is to make the top four theres no ifs or buts about that its a must
4349677 once we get there well have another goal to make the grand final and then obviously to win it
4349678 i was at the a league launch in sydney and we were well and truly under the radar no one expects us to do very well well see what happens this year
4349679 within ourselves we want top four and thats what we will be striving for thats a realistic goal i believe we can achieve
4349680 a few of the overseas players no ones seen them play before theyre all new
4349681 a few of the other boys have come from state league teams from around the country so it our squad is a bit unknown i think we are a bit underestimated at the moment
4349682 i was a little flat but it got over the line so that is all that matters
4349683 i feel very good i expended very little energy so i think i have a lot to give in the final
4349684 you are pushing my f buttons do you want me to f hit you
4349685 no reason just angry i guess just angry and self defence as well
4349686 this is a family matter i think there will be plenty of families in this town who have or are experiencing this
4349687 it is because of my position that we are doing this most people deal with it in silence
4349688 the world has been turned upside down that is what it is like living with an alcoholic
4349689 hes got a definite point of difference hes great on set pieces exceptional on set pieces
4349690 hes a very laconic sort of character you dont get much out of him in terms of vocal input but his football i think will speak for itself
4349691 set pieces are something i work very hard on hopefully i can do a job for the team and add something to our attack
4349692 i played against him in the pre season cup and he gave me a good whack but id rather be copping a whack from him than watching him whack someone else
4349693 stuey musialik we wont be using in the game it would have been game four in nine days and its too big an ask ill probably look at using bridgey off the bench but ill see how he feels itll become his decision
4349694 youre never happy with a draw were going to come and play football were not going to try to kill the game off at all

4349716 you are pushing my f buttons do you want me to f hit you
4349717 no reason just angry i guess just angry and self defence as well
4349718 this is a family matter i think there will be plenty of families in this town who have or are experiencing this
4349719 it is because of my position that we are doing this most people deal with it in silence
4349720 the world has been turned upside down that is what it is like living with an alcoholic
4349721 no one wants anyone from perth in any sport to win it
4349722 no one used to like it when we were successful in the old nsl so theyre going on what happened in the previous season
4349723 its a new start this season and everyone starts on zero points so they can go on all they want about sydney or anyone else its up to us every time we step onto the park to prove them wrong
4349724 weve spoken about what we want to achieve this year and our main goal our first goal is to make the top four theres no ifs or buts about that its a must
4349725 once we get there well have another goal to make the grand final and then obviously to win it
4349726 i was at the a league launch in sydney and we were well and truly under the radar no one expects us to do very well well see what happens this year
4349727 within ourselves we want top four and thats what we will be striving for thats a realistic goal i believe we can achieve
4349728 a few of the overseas players no ones seen them play before theyre all new
4349729 a few of the other boys have come from state league teams from around the country so it our squad is a bit unknown i think we are a bit underestimated at the moment
4349730 i think the afl are up there checking it right now and well obviously have a look at it later on today
4349731 we wanted it to be suitable to play an afl game we will demand that
4349732 were going out there today to train and well certainly have a look at it up close
4349733 we had a lot of boys that were playing together for the first time in a long time
4349734 you would expect them to be a little bit rusty you would also expect them to be a little bit better this week
4349735 sammy rapira is getting that big right arm free and it is only a matter before mckinnon just steams onto one and runs under the posts
4349736 they have got a couple of big hard running centres
4349737 they kick well they will probably finish their sets well all the things that we try and do really
4349738 they have been one of the better sides all season and we lost to them last time they are coming into it with some good form the challenge is up to us
4349739 to try and get it working as well as we can is the most important thing that is the focus this week
4349740 we are fighting the fire internally and externally there are two turntable ladders spraying water down on the building and ten appliances
4349741 our main aim is to stop the fire spreading to the cornmill shopping centre
4349742 the alarm went off at 12 30am at first we thought it was a false alarm as we had a drill last night then we realised it was for real
4349743 when we came out of the pub all we could see was smoke coming out of the roof and within a matter of minutes flames were coming out there was loads of people coming out of the hotel but it didnt look like anyone was seriously injured the fire brigade were already here when we came out but more and more engines kept coming
4349744 we couldnt believe what we were seeing the flames could been seen from miles away it looked like the whole town centre was on fire the smoke and flames seemed to fill the sky
4349745 there were loads of firefighters running around when i got here it seemed like it was going to take a lot of them to bring it under control at one point it looked like they had put it out but the flames just started shooting out of the roof again
4349746 i couldnt believe what i was seeing there was people everywhere just stood around watching what was going on a lot of the people who had come out of the hotel looked quite frightened many of them seemed to be from china or japan they didnt really know what was going on the police managed to move them to safety quite quickly
4349747 the crews are now winding down and we believe that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of the hotel is still usable
4349748 we have been successful in preventing the fire spreading to commercial premises and we are now winding down operations
4349749 there was an issue with water and we had to pump extra supplies from the river skerne
4349750 we are now liasing with the utilities the police and the council with a view to containing the area but to get as much of the town centre open as possible
4349751 we can now start moving into the building to salvage as much as possible and assess hazards the investigation into the cause will also begin its too early to say what has happened but it looks like it started on the fourth floor
4349752 then relax and enjoy the reassurance that you have extra credit available if and when you need it
4349753 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things
4349754 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing
4349755 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4349756 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase
4349757 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4349758 the letters also use positive words and especially avoid the word debt
4349759 i was a little flat but it got over the line so that is all that matters
4349760 i feel very good i expended very little energy so i think i have a lot to give in the final
4349761 hes got a definite point of difference hes great on set pieces exceptional on set pieces
4349762 hes a very laconic sort of character you dont get much out of him in terms of vocal input but his football i think will speak for itself
4349763 set pieces are something i work very hard on hopefully i can do a job for the team and add something to our attack
4349764 i played against him in the pre season cup and he gave me a good whack but id rather be copping a whack from him than watching him whack someone else
4349765 stuey musialik we wont be using in the game it would have been game four in nine days and its too big an ask ill probably look at using bridgey off the bench but ill see how he feels itll become his decision
4349766 youre never happy with a draw were going to come and play football were not going to try to kill the game off at all
4349767 our fans create a fantastic atmosphere at the football stadium second to none
4349768 worried anger i just dont know how we are going to fix this
4349769 it gets their attention they know that the entire law enforcement community is serious about gang activity and it wont be tolerated
4349770 how do you stay married in this day everyone says its hard isnt it hard
4349771 all over asia there are now epidemics of hiv in men who have sex with men of the same magnitude that we saw in this country 25 years ago

4349780 weve achieved more in the past five years than in the previous 20 years
4349781 but if we relax now it would be disastrous it would wipe out all of our previous investments
4349782 it is outrageous and insulting that james dobson would be nominated
4349783 dobson is a very accomplished broadcaster but i think its offset by the fact that hes a very accomplished liar
4349784 the last of a line of lasts the pale princess of a palace cracked
4349785 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
4349786 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
4349787 indicative of old mutuals confidence in sa and the economy
4349788 because property is a marathon not a sprint its important that we have a five to 10 year outlook when contemplating these large developments
4349789 we are building a development that will create the facade of high street shopping with an array of international and local retailers
4349790 we will also be densifying the area around the gautrain on the south end of the town centre with residential property
4349791 we have finalised an agreement with the government and bombela
4349792 the rail line will now be moved to the edge of the property along the k101 highway and that has allowed us the space to create the town centre as originally planned
4349793 she is a really nice filly and mark fransen left her down here with erv miller to race in lexington
4349794 she was unbelievably strong tonight and was just coasting through the wire
4349795 saya menyanjung tinggi komitmen yang diberikan ustaz hadi bahawa pas akan terus kekal dalam pakatan rakyat
4349796 saya juga berterima kasih dan menghargai sokongan pas khususnya tuan guru nik aziz untuk membantu saya di permatang pauh kerjasama ini amat saya alu alukan
4349797 you are the light of the world let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
4349798 sweetheart deals by the likes of christopher dodd kent conrad and barack obama himself
4349799 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies
4349800 tom coburn is like an imam at a pig roast he sees pork everywhere and he doesnt like it
4349801 no one has ever chosen to have dr coburn deliver her baby in order to sway his vote
4349802 were not looking for friends but only someone who is bearably social
4349803 texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough they arent a physically tough team
4349804 my defense will get to a point where they will be mean nasty and ornery bastards and thats what you need for texas
4349805 a robust interface that just may save the day when your external sound card decides to crap the bed just before your big show but the price tag is a jagged little pill
4349806 yes im overcompensating for my insecurities and lack of masculinity but ive got a really big dog
4349807 what we do is provide mentorship to all aspects of the afghan national army from logistics personnel operational support those kind of things
4349808 i think that when whites get to be a minority we can have more of a scandinavian style socialist society
4349809 i have never been joe citizen and dont plan to be for some time
4349810 i havent been that in 291 2 years never when i walk into a restaurant i know exactly who is sitting where what they are wearing who theyre facing how the cars are parked in the parking lot
4349811 i like the way we competed it was a challenge from the first day we stepped on the field with them we learned more about some young players competing against other players we feel like we know our team a little better
4349812 i think we get a lot out of this because youre getting a different look at different personnel and different schemes and its hard to simulate that anywhere else
4349813 they were banging heads against each other for a couple of days so tempers flared a little deuce mcallister for the first time since he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in september but running back reggie bush might miss saturdays game against the texans
4349814 to walk away and not have signed our third round pick would be disappointing
4349815 but obviously as time has gone on with this theres a self evaluation of what went wrong and what we could have done better
4349816 ill stand by all the work the scouts have done pre draft and post draft this more lies in the players heart they tend to waiver and change throughout the process
4349817 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4349818 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4349819 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4349820 while legal authorities investigate were in an observation phase to see if everything happened as expected or if there were deviations that caused damage in this case the death of seven kids
4349821 to make sure there is peace and stability in the region
4349822 the united states is committed toward securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4349823 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region
4349824 there is not a clash of civilizations but its a clash of ignorance that all sides need to work on
4349825 we are here to win football and we are planning to win our final three games and see what occurs from that starting with adelaide tomorrow
4349826 we were a touch disappointed how we played our first half of football last week it is not how we have been playing for the past eight weeks but we are fully wound up for this weeks game and we look to play aggressive football for the next three weeks
4349827 we are in a really exciting time at the club
4349828 mal is going to play his last three games at the club and jason johnson who will play for bendigo this week but will come into the side the next week will get to play the final two games with the essendon football club
4349829 it should be a celebration and really good time for the club because of the warriors they have been
4349830 we will continue to not only send off champions at the club but give younger players opportunity at senior level
4349831 young rhys magin is the perfect example of us giving our players opportunity
4349832 he will play for the club tomorrow and it will be good to give him another opportunity at senior level
4349833 mark wanted to play tomorrow he trained on wednesday and deliberately got himself involved in tackling drills and threw people on the deck and jumped around and wrestled to indicate he was right to play
4349834 when i went up to him and spoke to him he was a little disappointed that he wont play tomorrow but in saying that he will definitely will play the following week
4349835 we talked about it and a walk is a good thing
4349836 if he walks even when mike lowell is playing or jason bay there are men on base for those guys
4349837 i felt like i was struggling to get into a good groove all game
4349838 but the good thing was that i held the runners after allowing them to get on base
4349839 we need all of us here to accomplish our goals
4349840 the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world
4349841 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice
4349842 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4349864 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4349865 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4349883 this is plain lokohan foolishness and the milf cannot allow this to happen
4349884 the milf has told the government of the republic of the philippines that its options to solve the moro problem are reduced to only two choose vice governor emmanuel pi ol and his company who are pushing for war or to continue the path of peace with the milf
4349885 if the government wants the talks to progress it can do it it can think creatively but if it wants to stick to the constitution things will not move
4349886 never for a single moment did we talk about the sabah claim with malaysia as facilitator it is only practical for us not to bring that up or include sabah in our proposed homeland we are silent on the issue we never said it belongs to the bangsamoro people just as we never said it does not belong to us it is a nonissue for us at this point

4349894 we may be nearing the bottom of the property market its not certain when the turn will come but at least we will have bottomed out
4349895 the first but small step toward a property market recovery
4349896 the coupling of still too high interest rates and tight credit restrictions will continue to hamstring first time buyers but todays thursdays news will smooth some investor fears particularly adventurers in the lower end of the market in areas close to cbds where rental demand remains firm
4349897 this is momentous for both the economy and the man in the street
4349898 an additional rate hike would have potentially tipped the balance
4349899 our property prices should remain static for the next year this will effectively mean that with our current inflation rate we will probably not see any real price growth over the next year
4349900 however south africas economic stability and growth will continue to create job opportunities and thereby improve conditions for many people creating new entrants to the property market
4349901 there has been enormous pressure on tito mboweni not to put up interest rates again for fear that it will push even more people over the edge into over indebtedness and insolvency but the warning signs still remain with the banks giving hints that they are suffering a growing number of defaulting loans
4349902 there is no means of testing which decision is better because there is no basis for comparison we live everything as it comes without warning like an actor going on cold and what can life be worth if the first rehearseal for life is life itself
4349903 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin

4349906 therefore to him that knoweth to good and doeth it not to him it is sin

4349915 keputusan ini adalah perbincangan di peringkat pakatan rakyat bukan di dalam media
4349916 kerana ketika ini pakatan rakyat tidak ada ketua maka anwar yang paling layak
4349917 kita akan membincangkan siapakah pemimpin yang akan menjadi perdana menteri yang boleh diterima oleh semua rakyat oleh itu kita kena tunggu pada 16 september
