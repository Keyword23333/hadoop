6030000 its just a matter of seeing it believing it and just working at it and achieving it the guy who went 0 1 at the world championship just won the olympic title
6030001 since we beat the u s in our opener the good luck has stayed with us so far
6030002 i won this for her for friends and family but mostly for her
6030003 this is an opportunity ive wanted since i started wrestling at 5 25 years ago and its pretty sour to have on me
6030004 it happened so quick its just kind of a shock to me and its something ill deal with
6030005 i think they are going to be the olympic champions for sure
6030006 the attorneys felt that given the open ended nature of the policy we might well lose the lawsuit
6030007 what he said essentially is that our policy is broad enough to include virtually all nonprofit agencies
6030008 over the past several years ive been increasingly concerned with the volume of material we send home with students
6030009 the gist of the argument is that schools cannot ban distribution of a christian groups literature just because it is religious
6030010 im shocked and sad but im really happy for the girls who won
6030011 its going to hit me maybe in the morning and im going to sit and cry its a dream come true i have no problem being the underdog thats less pressure on me more pressure on the people who are supposed to win
6030012 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control in the straightaway of the race

6030015 this study challenges the use of ice water immersion in athletes
6030016 ice water immersion offers no benefit for pain swelling isometric strength and function and in fact may make more athletes sore the next day
6030017 i dont find it hard to believe that the ice doesnt have any long term benefit although i would question whether the ice group really did feel more pain after 24 hours than the tepid group the problem with pain is that it is subjective and very hard to measure

6030025 we knew that a rescue operation would in practice mean the death of the hostages

6030041 depending on whose web site you look at or whose rpi or sagarin we had one of the top five schedules in america obviously we didnt have the team to withstand that we were not equipped to handle that
6030042 this year were going to have seven new players five recruits and two guys that sat out our schedule is a lot more conducive to us being able to build our team toward the big east
6030043 its the way it needs to be when youre playing in the big east youve got to be able to develop your team and get ready for big east play and have success in your non league schedule because 10 8 could be a good record in the big east
6030044 depending on whose web site you look at or whose rpi or sagarin we had one of the top five schedules in america obviously we didnt have the team to withstand that we were not equipped to handle that
6030045 this year were going to have seven new players five recruits and two guys that sat out our schedule is a lot more conducive to us being able to build our team toward the big east
6030046 its the way it needs to be when youre playing in the big east youve got to be able to develop your team and get ready for big east play and have success in your non league schedule because 10 8 could be a good record in the big east
6030047 its an advantage for us because we can keep the pressure on the defense now in a manner that we werent able to do last year
6030048 it requires defenses now to have players that have to stay on the field that whole series
6030049 there will be a lot of programs that will struggle early on in terms of how they handle the tempo
6030050 its going to be a lot faster just talking to the big east officials after our scrimmage they felt rushed quite a bit
6030051 the advantage for us is that we dont switch personnel in and out
6030052 were not completely changing fullbacks to tailbacks and receivers were keeping our same personnel so we can line up in multiple formations whereas if the offense switches personnel then the defense is allowed some time to get their personnel on the field
6030053 dustin understands the offense he understands where guys need to be thats just part of what he brings to the table what hes going to be able to do is take advantage of that and catch defenses a little bit out of place and a little bit off guard thats where some of his strength becomes better suited for what were trying to accomplish
6030054 we can go up and hit them with one play really fast and then the next time theyll think its coming fast and theyll go ahead and show what theyre going to be in which will help us be able to check plays and get ourselves in the best play possible
6030055 college football was becoming a little too situational with substitutions
6030056 thats all you were seeing was guys coming in and out of the game
6030057 its an advantage for us because we can keep the pressure on the defense now in a manner that we werent able to do last year
6030058 it requires defenses now to have players that have to stay on the field that whole series
6030059 there will be a lot of programs that will struggle early on in terms of how they handle the tempo
6030060 its going to be a lot faster just talking to the big east officials after our scrimmage they felt rushed quite a bit
6030061 the advantage for us is that we dont switch personnel in and out
6030062 were not completely changing fullbacks to tailbacks and receivers were keeping our same personnel so we can line up in multiple formations whereas if the offense switches personnel then the defense is allowed some time to get their personnel on the field

6030064 we can go up and hit them with one play really fast and then the next time theyll think its coming fast and theyll go ahead and show what theyre going to be in which will help us be able to check plays and get ourselves in the best play possible
6030065 and he ended up with 31 touchdowns and six interceptions given the opportunity who knows what dustin can do
6030066 our system really helps a quarterback and dustin really knows the system
6030067 i definitely think our o line is a lot better now
6030068 and i definitely think i can sit in the pocket and make better and quicker reads i feel much more comfortable with my pocket presence but i can still get out and scramble and make plays with my feet i think ive matured a lot in that aspect
6030069 its just the tempo and how fast we line up and how we adjust when we see whats open
6030070 coach kelly gets us into the right play every time
6030071 hes got a lot of experience and in college football boy youd pay a lot of money to have experience at the quarterback position
6030072 as much as people like to talk about hey whats the deal at quarterback its a pretty good situation to have with dustin
6030073 were pleased to be able to offer this special opportunity for ucs faculty and staff
6030074 its a great opportunity to promote campus pride in everyone and were able to provide a great value to watch bcs football to the uc family

6030079 the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
6030080 rose had the kind of macho rock persona that kurt detested
6030081 there was a lot of money on the table kurt really liked metallica
6030082 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day and one that well never forget
6030083 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
6030084 paul starr has this uncanny ability to look at a face and see what it needs
6030085 hes done my face a thousand times and never repeated a look i have never felt more like the best version of myself than when paul has made me up

6030092 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6030093 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6030094 we love auctions auction style listings remain the ideal choice for sellers who are uncertain about the value of their item have a scarce item in high demand or are willing to start at a low price and let bidding determine the final value
6030095 with these changes were making sure sellers have competitive opportunities in both formats auction style and fixed price

6030115 it is now clear that every possible subterfuge and procedural manoeuvre will be used to keep kaka in prison even though the investigating judge decided there are no grounds for prosecuting him
6030116 this persistence has reached unbelievable proportions and is indicative of the personal war that president mamadou tandja is waging against this journalist
6030117 we nonetheless think that nigers judicial system has taken a clear position and that our correspondent has no business being in niamey prison respect for judicial independence should force the authorities to put a stop to this absurd war against one man

6030132 the feedback we have had from the public has been great children particularly like the interactive displays and especially the water wheels which give them the chance to see water power in action

6030138 there are some families who have been here for 4 or 500 years they didnt cross the border the border crossed them
6030139 if glitter continues to refuse to leave he could be put in detention in bangkok and the conditions in prison here are not very good at all worse than in vietnam
6030140 thai immigration chiefs have told thai airways to deal with him they are talking to british authorities to try and get a deal to bring him back home
6030141 he has had access to british tv in his hotel and knows that if he does come back he might never be able to leave again
6030142 thai airlines are looking for someone who would take him at the moment but that is not an easy task
6030143 no one wants to inherit the problem that thailand has at the moment
6030144 it is a very unusual situation the thai government will have to order his expulsion and do have the power to expel him
6030145 we cant do anything to bring him back to the uk as he hasnt committed an offence in this country
6030146 i suspect he will end up back here because he is a uk citizen everyone else has the right to refuse him but we dont
6030147 as a former police officer i know that we have enough convicted sex offenders in this country as it is at the moment
6030148 although we have good legislation in this country to deal with these people do we have sufficient resources
6030149 monitoring might mean a weekly visit but what about the rest of the time proper surveillance is too costly both in terms of time and money

6030163 no it was the rest of us who were rich witnessing a moment that could only happen at the olympics and yes perhaps only in america
6030164 as a city renowned for our passion civic pride love of sports and great sense of humor we know that no one can tell our story better than our own people
6030165 we are asking all of those who believe in bringing the world to chicago for the 2016 olympic games to tell their own story of
6030166 chicago 2016 is truly a community wide effort and nothing will speak louder to the world than passionate chicagoans telling their own chicago 2016 story
6030167 through the chicago 2016 channel the people of chicago are inviting the world to our city in 2016 we believe that no one can tell the chicago story more authentically and persuasively than our people

6030180 this is an important moment for this fishery and could open the door for other japanese fisheries keen to demonstrate their sustainability through the mscs internationally recognised certification programme and ecolabel if there are no objections in this last phase of stakeholder consultation we could see the first japanese fishery certified in just over three weeks time
6030181 other fisheries have found that the msc eco label has brought interest from export markets the mscs independent certification process and traceability certification mean that seafood buyers can be sure that they are making a positive contribution towards safeguarding seafood supplies for this and future generations
6030182 at a time when eating out is more expensive people still want to treat themselves and the trend we are experiencing is that customers are turning to takeaway options such as fish and chips
6030183 the current financial climate is undeniably tougher across the board but in terms of value for money fish and chips is in a strong position offering a nutritious meal that wont break the bank
6030184 fish and chips have gone from strength to strength in recent years this great british staple offers terrific value for money and a real feel good factor as you tuck in fans of fish and chips have been really spoilt by the choice and high standards of the uks best shops

6030192 i didnt think i would lift him so easy because hes such a big bloke
6030193 im very optimistic about our chances of doing well with this
6030194 lets remember that san francisco ballet dancers in 1974 actually raised 2 million so it is possible
6030195 that anything short of a true regulatory program does more harm than good and should be abolished
6030196 with the downturn of the market and the ongoing crisis among lending institutions eroding consumer confidence in the housing industry by deregulating the building industry could be strike three to a fragile economy
6030197 the texas association of builders is disappointed that the sunset commission staff has recommended throwing the residential construction industry in this state back to a time when there was no regulation at all of the industry with no corresponding ability to prevent bad actors from continuing to harm texas consumers
6030198 no other regulatory agency has a program with such a potentially devastating effect on consumers ability to seek their own remedies

6030213 we hebben afgesproken niet verder dan vijfhonderd yuan te gaan een volledig chinees maandloon lijkt me wel genoeg winst op zwarte kaarten
6030214 er hangen waarschuwingsborden dat scalping verboden is die zijn onzichtbaar doordat er zoveel handelaren staan
6030215 ik heb het idee dat de strenge regels vooral voor chinezen gelden een franse uitwisselingsstudent onderhandelde met me terwijl een agent meekeek
6030216 gamers will have access to one league of their choice for a free trial from the moment they activate it to the end of the 2008 2009 season
6030217 this is an ambitious and completely unique feature that has never been attempted before for football videogames
6030218 the game will feel and play differently each week with adidas live season if ronaldinho has a great match on the weekend youll feel the difference when you pick up the controller as his in game attributes increase
6030219 i have been in that position you are hungry and determined and you want to win it simple as that we have got to match their determination their hunger and their desire but we have players at the club who have tasted success over the last couple of years and want more
6030220 the critical factor for sustained achievement is not only a function of ability or talent but 80 of achievement is dependent on emotional intelligence
6030221 its totally frustrating especially after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
6030222 it was the amount of lockdown that surprised me the most
6030223 technology is an important thing in my personal and work life and i think the two of them should be connected
6030224 we see this as a real opportunity to start altering the cost model to deliver it
6030225 jai un probl me avec lampoule de ma salle de bain

6030230 ce que nous avions nous demand cest quil y ait dabord priorit tout ce qui est effort de reconstruction de redressement de lafghanistan et puis surtout dencadrement et daccompagnement de larm e afghane
6030231 ceux qui doivent assurer la s curit des afghans ce sont les afghans eux m mes ce nest pas une op ration doccupation que nous avons faire
6030232 if you hate america so much why dont you move to cuba
6030233 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
6030234 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
6030235 but they can also be taken away at any time
6030236 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
6030237 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
6030238 we have no records of these two names in our system
6030239 in my mind i have to wait and to see what the doctor says
6030240 if its economically possible to do the next operation i will do it if not ill go back home
6030241 somebody comes here in a healthy state with their whole life ahead of them in a very good program and is contributing to life here
6030242 to send him back and say this is how they treat you in america its just not right
6030243 the thing that is more shocking than that 20 000 is the minimum is that its the minimum for taxicabs
6030244 they are on the road more than any other driver
6030245 it was the most heartbreaking feeling to see him in the condition he was in
6030246 hes held together by so many things in so many places you almost think he should have a bubble around him
6030247 a prototype from her paris hilton push up bra line
6030248 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
6030249 he essentially drank himself to a state where the average human being would have been incapacitated or dead
6030250 i think theyre responding to issues that were problematic then that are no longer problematic today
6030251 it seems a little behind the curve since the decision has already been made to close the facility
6030252 perhaps the purpose is to monitor the closing process and oversee that transition
6030253 if it hadnt been for this i wouldnt have moved her for anything
6030254 being a fast intense spectator sport it suits young peoples expectations
6030255 in china alone more than 102 million people watched the games live online
6030256 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
6030257 tu es une personne fabuleuse si on pousse le bouchon trop loin que lui arrive t il au bouchon tats unis
6030258 i have great concerns about petitioners habitual consumption of prescription painkillers ambien sleeping pills and rum or vodka each night and during the day i have observed petitioner wake up on many mornings in a stupor from her nightly cocktail petitioner is in no condition to drive in the morning i have warned petitioner on numerous occasions to refrain from transporting our children in the car when she is in such a state
6030259 and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord
6030260 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword
6030261 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6030262 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6030263 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6030264 there are some crumbs of comfort that the weapons deployment has been botched or else more likely dissidents have been infiltrated and at the last moment the explosives undermined and therefore lives saved
6030265 however we cannot always rely upon infiltration and treachery within the ranks of the dissidents to undermine their activity
6030266 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6030267 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6030268 we do not believe it is right that any chances should be taken with the health and safety of these workers
6030269 youre dealing with expecting mothers and expecting families all the time
6030270 this is actually for the families to experience when pregnant women get their ultrasounds done in a hospital its pretty much for diagnostic reasons
6030271 theyll come in and sit on a comfortable sofa while watching the session on a large flat screen tv
6030272 these ultrasounds they get in the hospital are actually only two dimensional images which are perfect for diagnosing any problems that the baby might have but often its very difficult for people who have an untrained eye to actually see the images and understand what they are looking at
6030273 they can see clear images even facial features that the baby has
6030274 its really good if they have a partner who works away and was unable to make their medical ultrasound
6030275 i did visit the halifax location in the spring while i was making the decision of whether i was going to do this or not and i was only up there one hour and i met two newfoundlanders who travelled to halifax to have this service
6030276 i would consider that myself for sure i have a lot of friends that are you know pregnant or have been pregnant and weve all said the same thing it would be nice to have another ultrasound doctors these days tend to only give one ultrasound
6030277 especially with a sister in calgary whod love to be here
6030278 recommending parents not expose their unborn babies to fetal ultrasound for the purpose of making keepsake videos
6030279 no confirmed health risks for the baby or the mother
6030280 although this is very reassuring there is also suggestive evidence that there may be a biological effect on the fetus even during diagnostic use
6030281 strongly opposes the non medical use of ultrasounds to view or photograph the fetus
6030282 at the start of the season they made an offer which cambridge accepted but i promptly turned it down
6030283 by the time i did agree to a move it felt like i had no other option
6030284 i was advised to go on loan for a few months to get experience but again i turned it down
6030285 we signed another midfielder in jon challinor and two games into the season i was on the bench twice and i thought there was no way in for me
6030286 i spoke to the manager to say goodbye and he said he wanted to keep me
6030287 i never sanctioned ben farrell going to histon at all i dont want him to go i want him to stay
6030288 its good of him to come out and say im part of his plans he showed a lot of support to me
6030289 shawn ralph didnt leave him in the freezing cold water waiting for hours to be rescued
6030290 it was because of the coast guard and the department of national defence not shawn ralph that those bodies were lost
6030291 that man didnt set out on that voyage to destroy any lives
6030292 they shouldve and couldve been charged with neglecting their duty
6030293 it seemed like the coast guard had no backup system
6030294 i think this here was more of a deflection because of some neglect on their part and theyre coming out with charges i dont think its really reasonable
6030295 the system failed my brother and if anybody is guilty its the system we rely on
6030296 nothing has changed since this accident and im afraid something like this will happen again
6030297 monroe bank will enjoy substantial speed increases in available bandwidth between our many banking center locations

6030300 we enjoy working with smithville digital another locally owned monroe county company and we look forward to a continued partnership
6030301 the record number of veterans competing this year is a true testament to the competitive spirit of our nations veterans once again our veterans are proving that age is not a barrier to an active rewarding life
6030302 i am delighted that this premier sporting event for our senior veterans is being held in indianapolis this year one of americas premier sports cities i want to thank representative buyer for his long standing support for so many va programs like the golden age games that provide americas veterans with the services they have earned

6030304 i am looking forward to veterans nation wide participating in the games experience hoosier hospitality

6030315 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6030316 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6030317 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6030318 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices

6030371 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
6030372 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
6030373 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
6030374 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
6030375 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
6030376 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
6030377 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
6030378 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
6030379 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the philadelphia eagles i told the coach if i am on the football field to treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think they were considering what i did in the game i felt like i could have done more

6030657 the answer is not building more jails and keeping the revolving door system of criminal justice going
6030658 so much of this revolves around race its our original sin weve all bitten from that apple our country was founded on racial violence

6030663 i dont know because i have never been at a foreign club you need to try something first in order to know
6030664 on the one hand its easier as a pair but on the other alone the situation forces you to get used to new conditions quicker both language and life
6030665 everything will depend on what kind of offer will be made to the club and to me my move to a top club definitely would reflect well on the image of spartak

6030685 its totally frustrating but you wont find me sitting in the corner and sulking
6030686 its especially frustrating after flogging yourself for eight weeks in pre season and then just when you start to look forward to the games this happens
6030687 i had only been on a few minutes when i went in for a cover tackle and took the impact on my thumb as soon as it happened i knew i was in a bit of trouble
6030688 i can still train and i shall use this time to get fitter and stronger and turn this time into an advantage

6030692 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live amp let die
6030693 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6030694 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6030695 he was a huge bond fan and he said that he would love to direct one of the films hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited and went looking for producer cubby broccoli to tell him
6030696 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
6030697 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
6030698 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
6030699 allow ourselves a bit more leeway in terms of sculpting the sound in the studio and doing overdubs and using the studio as another instrument last time around it was more of a document
6030700 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
6030701 theres no excuse for it it cant happen especially in the middle of a pennant race
6030702 vi har indtil videre ikke m rket noget til den konomiske krise men det vil v re en fejl at tro at den vil passere os fuldst ndigt
6030703 hvis vi ser p konjunkturerne i europa s er de langt barskere end vi havde forudset ser vi p konsumenternes reaktioner er de langt st rre og voldsommere end vi historisk har set vi vil altid v re konjunkturf lsomme vi er en cyklisk virksomhed det er der ingen tvivl om
6030704 i guess its fair to say that were getting close to that position at the moment were really really hopeful that there can be some other possible way through
6030705 the inability of some of these people conservatives to reason is based on their need for their political worldview to always be in line with the direction of their proaganda and not along the ley lines of real power real economic success or real diplomatic solutions
6030706 i dont have anything against capitalism but if you are so gung ho in capitalism then why does this blog and said members support those who are the antithesis of capitalism i myself oppose those who oppose capitalism but i see nothing on this blog but envious ass kissing to those politicians and organizations who oppose capitalism in all its forms it would be great for this blog to show its objections to that effect but i dont see it
6030707 merely riding the current of change complaining all the while is a path that leads only to cynicism and failure its seductively self indulgent but its just plain wrong the alternative is choosing to act
6030708 tarradellas le molestaba todo lo que pasaba en catalu a en el mbito de la resistencia y la recuperaci n de las libertades nacionales desde que el levantaba hasta que se iba a dormir s lo ten a una tarea mantener viva la generalitat a base de repetirse a si mismo que l era el presidente mientras eso el cambio pol tico no se produjera mientras la hora de la generalitat no llegara nadie deb a hacer nada
6030709 a tarradellas le gustaba rodearse de una corte en las jornadas electorales se le notaba cierta malicia mientra observaba el sufrimiento de los l deres cuando los resultados iban llegando
6030710 se coment que el presidente tarradellas presion para que en la segunda sesi n de investidura erc mantuviera su abstenci n y mi candidatura tuviera que ser elegida en la tercera votaci n con el desgaste de imagen que esto hubiera significado para mi yo entiendo la actitud de tarradellas humanamente es comprensible tarradellas hab a pasado veinticuatro a os en el exilio esperando el momento en el que l devolver a la generalitat ahora bien una cosa es ser comprensivo con la resistencia de tarradellas de abandonar un poder que se le hab a hecho muy corto y otra cosa es que la situaci n no se pod a dilatar y que el proceso de sucesi n deb a hacerse en unos plazos razonables

6030713 james mcfadden is a great player who has been brilliant for us
6030714 hes been instrumental in our good start to the season and the only thing he hasnt done is actually score but he has certainly made a huge impression for birmingham city
6030715 that has to be a worry for us going into the game surprisingly though i havent really played against him even in training i usually try and make sure that im on his team
6030716 hes a quality player who is so creative with a lethal shot on him and im lucky to see that in training every day hes a player who hates to lose and that is a great quality to have
6030717 the banter has already been flying between us and i read the complimentary things he wrote in his newspaper column
6030718 the boss alex mcleish and his backroom staff have even got in on the act because they are all scottish so its imperative we get a decent result
6030719 its a great honour and one that was totally unexpected i didnt give it much thought even when i knew aaron was out
6030720 nigel pulled me aside though and told me and i must admit im very proud i cant wait to lead the boys out and i think it will mean more to me because we are playing against scotland our near neighbours
6030721 ive never played at hampden park so it another great stadium that will be crossed off the list theres going to be a terrific atmosphere inside the stadium and im sure most of the noise will come from our fans as usual
6030722 the fans deserve a performance and thats exactly what well give them
6030723 despite the number of withdrawals i believe this game is mightily important ahead of the slovakia game it will give nigel the chance to see players who have maybe not played in that position before for who is to say those players out injured at the minute will be fit in three weeks time
6030724 if we gel together in this game and keep the momentum going from the euros then it will give us great confidence going to bratislava
6030725 our away form has not been great but hopefully that will change in the world cup games
6030726 it will have to if we are to have a chance of qualifying
6030727 playing in scotland will be a big test for us and a really useful exercise for the world cup qualifiers to come if we could get a good result it would be a confidence boost for us
6030728 i know a few of the boys playing for scotland and it would be great to get one over them
6030729 hampden is a fantastic place to play and hopefully we will put in a good performance
6030730 hampden is a famous ground and it is always a pleasure to play at stadiums like this and well be going all out to produce a big display
6030731 on behalf of the ustfccca it gives me great pleasure to welcome the 2008 inductees into the ustfccca hall of fame
6030732 we are once again privileged to have eight outstanding coaches join our previous hall of fame inductees
6030733 each of these nominees has honed the songwriting craft to perfection and the songs theyve given us are absolute treasures
6030734 positively impacted and been closely associated with the nashville music community and deemed to be outstanding and significant
6030735 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today we are dealing with a group of extremely competitive guys and john is one of them he agreed to the first three code violations but disagreed with the fourth for an obscene gesture john said that he did not do it and the umpire said he 100 percent categorically saw it we have to go with the umpires ruling
6030736 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
6030737 i dont really have anyone to blame but myself this is like a long story that culminates in me getting defaulted in a big tournament i mean i guess it was bound to happen its too bad i dont feel good about it but i cant say that im totally surprised
6030738 for the vast majority of players this is a non issue historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top we tell them the umpires to set guidelines early in the match so that the players know their boundaries if you dont things can get ugly quickly
6030739 we had our largest ever online voter turnout this year
6030740 the reach of gospel music is truly global and it is gratifying to see its influence grow
6030741 new york city has a longstanding reputation as the land of opportunity for aspiring artist and musicians and as a result some of the most internationally celebrated musical performers of this century have had their start right here on our streets
6030742 its only fitting that the role our city has played in launching the careers of so many of the worlds most talented artists be recognized and honored with the opening of the rock and roll hall of fame annex
6030743 establishing outposts like these is becoming a strategy of other major institutions
6030744 these projects allow museums to extend their reach but also provide space to travel exhibits and allow curators to display some of our priceless artifacts for the first time outside of cleveland
6030745 rock and roll is embedded in the history of our times and has changed the world around us
6030746 the rock and roll hall of fame and museum and now its extension the annex help us to illustrate in a tangible way musics impact on the cultural social and political history of the modern era
6030747 we are honored to recognize these two distinguished gentlemen for their outstanding achievements and the impact theyve made to improving not only our way of life in utah but to improving it throughout the world
6030748 over the years weve had some remarkable individuals elected to the utah hall of fame and both dr stanley and mr bingham should feel right at home with the other inductees
6030749 hofcommunity is dedicated to building a vibrant community of collectors memorabilia aficionados and those interested in the hall of fame industry
6030750 hofcommunity is where prestigious voices great people and collectors can gather and interact
6030751 were excited to unite the prestigious hall of fame industry with the passionate collectibles industry
6030752 there is much synergy between the two industries and their fan base and thus a need for a destination for them to interact hofcommunity will provide that destination
6030753 its a fantastic offer which could save our customers hundreds of pounds in interest payments
6030754 i am very excited to be rejoining the infotech team at t3i group

6030760 its all because of the internet and websites that they came to know he was back playing rugby and getting into top form
6030761 he is going to leicester for a week to check things out its not yet finalised when he will be leaving but it could be by the end of this week
6030762 teemu went on international duty but was sent back he has a muscle strain and hell be a doubt for saturday
6030763 i had three players on the shopping list its gone up to four after the weekend
6030764 waggy picked up an injury on sunday and hell be out for 10 weeks he just hurt his knee in a block tackle with kav graham kavanagh straight away you could tell it was a bad one
6030765 more striking than the head to head matchup however is the drop in obamas favorable rating
6030766 at the same time his negative rating has risen to 35 from 27
6030767 most voters say they know at least some people who feel uneasy about electing a black president 17 say the country is not ready to do so
6030768 the poll found that mccain faces serious obstacles voters favor obama on the economy the issue they rank as most important mccains supporters remain less enthusiastic than those of his rival and independents a crucial swing bloc are leaning toward obama
6030769 since we know how stressful it has been to watch your access to the candidate diminish under steve schmidts new rules we hope youll accept this oil barrel shaped stress ball along with some additional exxon mccain 08 paraphernalia it is the least we can do
6030770 theres such a sense of pride and accomplishment when you are finished
6030771 and nothing like seeing peoples faces when they receive something delicious youve made anyone can make jam or jelly just follow the recipe to a t
6030772 have fun but also write everything down so you remember for next year like how much fruit to buy what you did that worked or didnt or any flavors you added that you liked
6030773 if you are going to bother to go that far why not add one more step
6030774 we hope that employers and employees will take advantage of the challenges and activities each week of the month
6030775 experiencing the joy and sense of well being from this celebration will hopefully encourage workplaces to initiate and sustain a healthy workplace strategy that incorporates nqis three critical elements healthy lifestyle practices occupational health and safety and the physical environment and a culture of fairness and respect
6030776 as presenting sponsor we are pleased to support the expansion of this initiative from one week to a full month helping to further raise awareness of the importance and benefits of workplace wellness for organizations and individuals alike as a leading provider of life and health insurance and as caring members of the communities we serve great west life takes special interest in supporting innovative programs that address the health and wellness concerns of canadians
6030777 i have taught the class seven times in marion and know that there must be a need in crawford county as well
6030778 families in marion have expressed their deep appreciation for the help and support they have received from this class and the free huge notebook of materials
6030779 when i graduated high school my parents said they would would either pay for a wedding or a college education and i chose to get married
6030780 i was afraid of failure and more afraid of being a poor example to my children
6030781 some of our scholars start with us in the seventh grade
6030782 we support those students through the 12th grade and then they can apply for a college scholarship and then for the graduate award that karen got we can easily work with students for 15 years or more and support up to 600 000 is available to those students

6030787 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
6030788 the particular substance that was found is not a performance improving drug nor is it a masking drug but it is still prohibited
6030789 obviously those are the kinds of things this committee is considering
6030790 we cant say much on this because its continuing in terms of the hearing
6030791 what we can say is the player is suspended and did not participate in the tournament the review committee continues to gather the most information that we can
6030792 changs test was conducted outside of competition separate from the tests each team was subject to upon arriving in china
6030793 one of the things that happens when you have a wider screen of testing if we tested the whole population on the globe you know were going to get a lot of positive tests
6030794 and again some of these are over the counter kinds of things we would like to move to a world where in all of our competitions people are subject to out of competition testing this is a problem that is faced by most sports on the olympic program
6030795 he got ill in 2006 and had a bad time
6030796 but now he has fully recovered from his illness and regained his power
6030797 much more good in terms of human happiness than 90 per cent of the work done in parliament on what is called political issues
6030798 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us and there is no doubt that his aggressive regional ambitions will lead him into future confrontations with his neighbors confrontations that will involve both the weapons he has today and the ones he will continue to develop with his oil wealth
6030799 but after a good luncheon at the white house with people who had their hearts in the right place mr bush also realised that he can no longer save mr musharraf
6030800 would not be arrested prosecuted or punished in any other way
6030801 ik ben niet zo handig op de computer en het was nogal een gedoe dat formulier in te vullen ik heb er geen prioriteit aan gegeven als ik het nu niet tien dagen na terugkomst uit peking alsnog doe krijg ik een waarschuwing ik ga het thuis wel regelen
6030802 mijn vrouw krijgt die brief thuis op het moment dat ik in peking net de finale van de 100 m vrij heb gehaald mensen moeten dan toch weten dat ik hier ben
6030803 ik heb niks te verbergen maar er moet voor de nieuwe generatie wel een betere oplossing komen de atletencommissie en de atleten zelf moeten daar toch goede afspraken over gaan maken zoals het nu gaat is het echt niet prettig
6030804 als je vier uur voor je medicijnen fruitsap drinkt heeft dit geen effect het is wel belangrijk dat je er genoeg tijd tussen laat pillen neem je best met water in op een nuchtere maag
6030805 het was niet makkelijk voor mij om te kiezen tussen john en rio ferdinand
6030806 want het zijn beiden goede spelers al blijft rio een belangrijke speler voor het team
6030807 ik denk dat iedereen wel beseft wat dit voor mij betekent het is een hele eer en ik moet toegeven dat ik wel een beetje verrast was iedereen sprak maar over rio als nieuwe kapitein dus dat ik als leider van deze talentrijke groep wordt gekozen doet me heel wat ons doel is nu de kwalificatie voor het wk 2010 veilig stellen
6030808 georgi hergroepeert en versterkt zijn troepen nabij de grens met het separatistische gebied zuid osseti en doet dit met behulp van andere staten
6030809 wanneer de agressor georgi voor zijn agressie in het gelijk wordt gesteld kan hem dit alleen tot nieuwe militaire avonturen aansporen
6030810 lunch should not be skipped for both employee health and productivity
6030811 workers are worried about what people will say if they take too long on their break
6030812 the biggest thing employers can do for productivity is encourage lunch workers tend to have a lot more energy if they take a break meaning theyre more on the ball for the afternoon stretch
6030813 you will find youre getting more work done than if you didnt break at all

6030816 they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign but im here to tell you in albuquerque that its not going to work this time
6030817 people say that i caused it dont they but thats wrong
6030818 i would have dug us out of it it takes you a while to do it
6030819 these things happen international circumstances cause things to happen and what you have to do is work your way out of them
6030820 i have no doubt that that is what the taoiseach will do now and my former colleagues
6030821 you just have to work hard there is no solution all of us whatever career were in when times get difficult and its not your fault you just have to work hard and knuckle down to it if you do that youll make the right decisions and with good counsel you can work your way through
6030822 i have been doing bits of everything it takes a bit of getting used to ive an interesting winter ahead
6030823 thats going to bring me straight into a lot of the conflicts on the world stage with a prestigious group of people like tony and bill and jimmy carter
6030824 most of my work was answering questions not actually asking them so its a bit more difficult being in that position

6030855 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
6030856 this is not the end of the competition commission process
6030857 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counterproductive
6030858 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

6030882 only on my way here schamasch phoned me to say this athlete tested positive the process is underway
6030883 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6030884 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6030885 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
6030886 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6030887 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
6030888 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6030889 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6030890 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6030891 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is underway
6030892 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
6030893 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
6030894 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
6030895 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

6030898 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
6030899 the u va team hypothesizes that feeding the algae more carbon dioxide and organic material could boost the oil yield to as much as 40 percent by weight
6030900 published evidence of improved algae oil output might spur significant follow up efforts by public and private sectors since the fundamentals of this technology are so appealing
6030901 jesus agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
6030902 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
6030903 it will not be huge but it will be significant
6030904 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
6030905 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
6030906 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say

6030909 it is thrilling to see how eager the chinese are to read running the race and embrace the story of eric liddell
6030910 in fact liddell who due to his birth and death in the country is honoured as chinas first olympic champion and they are drawn to this great man who cut his athletic career short so that he could serve christ among the chinese people during their hour of severest trial
6030911 and best yet through our efforts the gospel that eric preached is still being preached today in the land that he loved the race that he started is still being run today for gods glory

6030916 thank god women saw sense and you can do that again
6030917 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
6030918 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
6030919 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
6030920 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
6030921 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
6030922 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
6030923 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines
6030924 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6030925 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6030926 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6030927 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6030928 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6030929 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6030930 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6030931 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease

6030942 but abrams fears were not hypothetical it happened just as abram had feared
6030943 and it will come about when the egyptians see you that they will say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will let you live
6030944 if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself
6030945 if we endure we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us
6030946 the bible does not condemn his action but the results condemn it so we are to learn by cause and effect relationships
6030947 yet all the indications are that abram did not stop to enquire but went on his own initiative taking everything into account but god his craven and tortuous calculations are doubly revealing both of the natural character of this spiritual giant cf jas 5 l7a and of the sudden transition that can be made from the plane of faith to that of fear
6030948 pabh p 55 does state that a certain papyrus document states that the pharoah had a husband killed that he might have the beautiful wife modern times do not have a corner on such deeds
6030949 sarais acquiescence however seems to grow out of the idea that there actually is no other safe course to follow she was as sadly deficient in faith as he himself on this occasion

6030954 the best system for picking a chief executive suited to a nation like ours a geographically large ideologically diverse socially complex federal republic
6030955 i can only go by the polls which show mccain winning the state handily
6030956 if senator mccain is truly getting such a large percentage of the jewish vote its probably an indicator that heavily democrat areas of florida will not hold up for senator obama and will cause obama to lose the state
6030957 a person of principle who has a great record of supporting israel
6030958 understands that israel is our strong ally and is committed to protecting the jewish state
6030959 obama has vowed to meet with iranian leaders who have called israel names that i prefer not to repeat
6030960 veterans understand that mccain has been in their position before
6030961 the country first mentality is a common factor for many vets and military and they know that mccain has the experience needed
6030962 obama has stated on several occasions that he would meet with leaders such as fidel castro without preconditions many latinos are noticing what is happening with leaders such as chavez or evo morales and they oppose obamas plans and can see that he does not have the experience needed to deal with latin america
6030963 the situation in congress demonstrates the lack of interest for the environment and our energy crisis and people are becoming more aware of what is happening
6030964 the american people deserve a commander in chief who puts their country first ahead of party politics and self interest senator obama is slowly revealing himself to americans and many do not like what they see
6030965 in ohio kitchen table issues are dominant ohio has lost 250 000 manufacturing jobs to places like china and mexico due to the failed bush economic policies that john mccain promises to continue
6030966 there isnt an attack ad in the book that can save john mccain if ohio voters walk into the voting booth thinking about their jobs their mortgages their gas tanks or their grocery bills
6030967 jobs have disappeared abroad mainly because unions require 35 per hour salaries with pensions and vacations for 55 year olds who watch machines all day and take long lunches think that flies in beijing
6030968 the democrats cannot use gas prices and heating bills as reasons veterans will discount john mccain who has spent nearly his entire life in service to his country
6030969 words like duty honor and country belong in a much more powerful context to men who have fought for our freedom
6030970 it is almost entirely due to the northern virginia area the only area thats truly liberal
6030971 say they will vote for obama but these same people will condemn obama amongst their friends so the polls might not be as accurate as we think
6030972 in every single presidential election ive observed the democratic candidate has always had a significant lead over the republican candidate
6030973 in the home state of john ashcroft where a republican governor has 76
6030974 to win here you must appeal to both the metro and rural voter this is why missouri is a bell weather
6030975 farmers will be watching for the candidate who will extend his hand to help them they cannot be overlooked
6030976 iowans especially farmers can spot fakes be honest or be gone
6030977 being a middle american seeing someone who isnt even officially the candidate acting like hes already won the election is a major turn off because it comes off as arrogant and presumptuous
6030978 iowans expect our leaders to be humble and accountable not a rock star
6030979 the iowa economy is better than much of the country
6030980 it is slowing just not as much i think it may be somewhat of an advantage but it is still to early to tell senator mccain is working hard in iowa and i think he will do well in our state
6030981 independent voters are beginning to hop off the obama bandwagon as they learn more about his liberal voting record and recognize his lack of experience
6030982 groups that i do see as potential pickups for john mccain are women and reagan democrats
6030983 john mccains bipartisan immigration plan has been well received by many in the latino community evidenced by mccains dominance in winning the votes of latino republicans during the primary and caucus season
6030984 if the best solution that obama has is to 87
6030985 most of the eastern border of the state is conservative as well especially down in the southeast quadrant of the state where it is rural in the west texas sense very conservative small towns with lots of oil and that love high school football
6030986 the latino hispanic mexican american vote is largely democratic by registration and geography
6030987 while heavily hispanic counties voted for clinton during the 2008 presidential preference caucus the obama campaign is running a robust hispanic outreach program
6030988 the native american community in new mexico is heavily registered as democrats
6030989 these communities will definitely play an important role in turning new mexico blue this fall
6030990 there are a large number of independent voters in albuquerque and las cruces and sen mccain has a proven ability to connect these voters
6030991 he also has great appeal to native americans and we therefore expect him to perform better with the navajo nation and among new mexico s pueblo indian population
6030992 conservative democrats appreciate senator mccains willingness and ability to reach across the aisle a skill obama has never shown which reinforces his status as an unknown and incredibly inexperienced presidential candidate
6030993 mccain is willing to explore all options to create a comprehensive and successful energy plan for america barack obama on the other hand continues to simply say no to common sense energy solutions that could reduce gas prices now and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
6030994 voters in new mexico share the same concerns as small business owners families of servicemen and women in iraq or as commuters having a hard time paying for higher gas prices
6030995 barack obama is a candidate who will prioritize the concerns of working class families
6030996 voters who honor the life of the unborn and support traditional marriage will support senator mccain in large numbers
6030997 obama as with so many issues shows his incredibly liberal viewpoint on social issues that are so important to voters with a strong faith while a state senator he voted against allowing medical care to babies who survive an abortion procedure its hard to get farther left than that
6030998 many of those who populate the suburban towns around manchester and nashua left the state of massachusetts because they felt alienated by that states politics
6030999 but for the past two years new hampshire residents have lived under a democratic majority in the state legislature and the sky has not fallen
6031000 i do not think veterans are monolithic or that their votes hinge on issues involving the military or the war
6031001 new hampshire has relatively low church attendance and our evangelicals tend to be yankees that is more private about their faith than evangelicals in other parts of the country
6031002 mike huckabee only got 11 of the primary vote here
6031003 mccain has been here four times since winning the primary which speaks to his understanding of us a swing state

6031011 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6031012 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6031013 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6031014 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6031015 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6031016 this kind of information is useful in confirming the epidemiology of the virus determining when it arrived in certain areas and how it spreads
6031017 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6031018 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6031019 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
6031020 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
6031021 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6031022 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
6031023 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
6031024 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
6031025 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
6031026 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
6031027 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
6031028 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
6031029 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
6031030 we just believe that its time for us to look at other options for our kids as opposed to corporal punishment
6031031 we think theres more effective ways most of our principals have chosen not to use it even though its been in the book were trying to create some consistency
6031032 we looked at the large haul of medals that the brits got this year and discovered that it caused the media to completely overlook chinas appalling human rights record its as if it has magically disappeared

6031051 also im not doing it alone although i do have to do it more than the others ill have to work the magic for the women in the audience i want them to feel theyre living it with me
6031052 im only in the bill until october then its finished

6031054 she has chosen not to renew her contract when it ends later this year
6031055 louisa has decided to move on after two years to try new things
6031056 so the producers said they wanted to give me another chance when i got the phone call i was crying tears of joy out of my living room window it was nine years ago since i last walked the cobbles so ive been lost at sea for that long
6031057 it was like finding my way back to the land of milk and honey i couldnt believe it im delighted to be back though
6031058 i didnt treat it as the golden opportunity that it was i lost my mum and basically i lost the plot
6031059 i was on the ale not paying attention and not being utterly professional its one of britains top soaps and to be called to play on that stage its on a par with being asked to play for england and you should really honour it have the commitment and give it everything youve got im 54 now and im never going to look a gift horse in the mouth again
6031060 i got carried away with myself i had to re audition for the part of jackie they wanted to see for themselves that i was on fighting form
6031061 they had the script ready for jackie dobbs but they sent me the script for auntie pam
6031062 its an absolute disgrace these stars have given their heart and soul to
6031063 bettys nearly 90 eileen and barbara are in their seventies and malcolm hebden is 68 instead of being rewarded for their contribution they are being treated little better than extras
6031064 i want to express the condolences and the pain of the afghan people to the for the loss that they suffered
6031065 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6031066 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6031067 the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6031068 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of zanu pfs unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6031069 companies who have users that do this essentially get free social advertising
6031070 you need to market to the customer the patron and most of your patrons are on the mass sites
6031071 if businesses incorporate it into their daily workplace just like answering phones or filing the exposure every day is building through other people
6031072 the main reason i think its great for someone like me is im a young businesswoman and my market has been young professional first time home buyers and thats a lot of who is on facebook
6031073 i dont think it would make sense for everybody but at the same time its free advertising just anything to get your name out there
6031074 you cant ignore this medium as another way people are having conversations
6031075 i think its a really efficient means of communication with a lot of like minded people its a lot quicker to send a blast to a network of professionals rather than picking up the telephone and calling 50 people
6031076 whenever you put the medium before the strategy its a recipe for disaster
6031077 determine if its a relevant tool in the toolbox that will complement other mediums
6031078 you wouldnt say i love billboards on interstate 83 lets build a campaign around that
6031079 when companies build applications they can choose to have a business model such as offering advertising or e commerce if they wish and keep that revenue
6031080 there is a lot of value in the sites that has yet to be understood and exploited
6031081 of course you can do business on facebook but linkedin is kind of like a business lunch
6031082 you go into it and you know you arent going to be sharing photos you arent going to be passing around baby pictures youre coming there to do business to get advice about your career the parties that are there all come there with a certain intent
6031083 sure you can get business done but its a lot harder because there are so many distractions

6031085 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
6031086 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
6031087 i think ea called take two and said you can either participate or not
6031088 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
6031089 that 25 74 was predicated on distributing their products at christmas this year
6031090 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price
6031091 a mutual deal is going to have to be higher than 25 74 in order for the board of take two to save face call it a dollar or two dollars more
6031092 the integration risk is that you lose the talent and ea cant afford to lose the talent

6031095 in the rainforest exposure to light during the day causes them to switch off but in caves there is no light to cause that to happen however they switch off of their own accord and they do it in synchrony
6031096 the most unexpected result of the study was they are out of sync with their surface relatives they glow most brightly when it is daylight outside the cave
6031097 the more we know about the factors that influence the glow intensity the better off managers of these sites will be in ensuring that the display is as attractive as possible while maintaining the long term health of the glow worm colonies

6031100 freedom can be denied for a while but it cannot be denied forever
6031101 poland has always been a strong defender of freedom even in dark days when it was not able to fully express its desire for freedom
6031102 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6031103 but it is even more important to have friends who share your hopes and aspirations and dreams and poland and the united states are those kinds of friends
6031104 the shield is in fact a sword of the white house and the polish government
6031105 nobody has the right to tell poland what to do times have passed
6031106 als erstes hat er unterk hlt reagiert er hat sich betrogen gef hlt als kate ihn f r seinen freund lance verlassen hat aber nach einer weile hat er sich darauf eingelassen und ist wieder lieb zu ihr es ist nicht fair gegen ber owen da sie ihm wirklich viel bedeutet und er am ende immer nur verletzt wird

6031110 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
6031111 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6031112 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
6031113 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
6031114 the new 005010 transaction standards are essential in implementing the icd 10 cm codes and lead promise to a health care system focused on improved efficiency and accuracy reduced costs and expanded care

6031116 in no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature and not to the executive department t he temptation would be too great for any one man
6031117 i dont think wed be spending the money weve spent on the stadium this summer if we were planning to move out next year
6031118 once the stadium is sold out five times over well look at opportunities and there might be opportunities at the stadium itself its too early to write off what we might be able to do here
6031119 weve got to stay focused on getting to the premier league and the location here is very important to the owners they bought into it because of the clubs history and the fact that its synonymous with this area
6031120 we feel very positive about playing at loftus road it gives us a good atmosphere and creates a 12th man on the pitch
6031121 traditionally weve had a very active role in the community
6031122 were investing in our football in the community scheme to help us extend that role further and engage with people who might have got out of the habit of going to qpr
6031123 we want to give them a motivating reason to get down to loftus road and well welcome them with open arms
6031124 i know john spicer from when i was arsenal so itll be good to play against him on saturday
6031125 everyone saw what bristol city did last season so we know what you can expect from a team thats just come up
6031126 from what ive heard sean odriscolls a good manager who likes to play attractive football so it should be a good game but the focus will be on our team and what we can do
6031127 were at home were strong there and well be looking to bounce back from sheffield united
6031128 every game we play we have to stay focused and do what the gaffer says
6031129 i dont think thats an excuse really were all experienced enough
6031130 we just need to have more shape as a team
6031131 i made a big mistake for the first goal i didnt watch the man so tactics went out of the window we never recovered from that and it was a disappointing day
6031132 there are big expectations and we need to deliver especially away from home because last season our away form wasnt good enough and thats the reason we were where we were
6031133 the late diana princess of wales was a big fan of john edwards lover rielle hunter at a dinner party she hosted in london hunter had someone read the dirty parts of jay mcinerneys story of my life to guests while the waiters stood behind the chairs and tried not to laugh

6031140 house sales have dropped by 50 this year and will probably fall further the bulk of mortgage lending this year has been to people who are not in fact moving house only 29 of mortgage lending has been to house buyers the rest has been to people staying put but moving to new mortgage deals such as former customers of the northern rock or to people borrowing extra sums against the value of their homes
6031141 sold in march with a june completion date i quit my job at the end of may to get sorted the buyer wanted to move 27th june but as my son was getting married that day i asked to move anytime after that then they pulled out so ive no job no money and a property which is difficult to sell its worth 270k but no one will pay that because of this stamp duty so ill never get an offer above 250k
6031142 i bought my house 2 years ago for 120k its been on the market for 9 months with 15 viewings but no offers ive dropped the price by 18k but still no interest its now on the market for 110k
6031143 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6031144 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6031145 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6031146 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6031147 the stereotype that i know of that people have said to me before that people in victor fairport penfield and webster have more money than maybe someone in henrietta spencerport and brockport
6031148 yeah i dont think its fair not equitable i mean were struggling as it is families are struggling to make ends meet now

6031156 these industrialists are grabbing land in noida and greater noida but are setting up industries in uttarakhand and haryana not a single industry has come up in noida or greater noida in recent years and the land acquired for industrial purposes is being used for building housing and commercial complexes there should be an inquiry into the land acquisitions in these places in recent years and the purpose for which the land was ultimately used
6031157 i strongly believe that the backward communities have been deprived a lot in our society one way to improve their condition is to empower them politically
6031158 since the issue of getting additional spectrum coordinated and released from defence services was vigorously pursued at various levels without any substantive results the prime minister felt the need to intervene by constituting a committee under mr nair to closely monitor and expedite the process of defence establishment vacating the spectrum under their possession
6031159 i cannot reveal my strategy now but im going to win the confidence of mlas inside the house
6031160 passing any discriminatory order in case of a male or female death will necessarily negate and defeat everything that the society the courts and other authorities have done for equality and empowerment of women in india
6031161 i once asked my father why he continued to do this being in politics why dont you consider leaving it i asked this was in the middle of a particularly hectic campaign schedule in 1989 when for two weeks we were working almost non stop
6031162 my father said no because i believe in the people of india now that i have been in politics for four five years i understand that at the core of it was his fundamental belief in the people of india
6031163 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6031164 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6031165 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6031166 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6031167 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6031168 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6031169 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6031170 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6031171 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6031172 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6031173 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6031174 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6031175 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6031176 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6031177 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6031178 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6031179 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6031180 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6031181 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6031182 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6031183 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6031184 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6031185 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6031186 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6031187 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6031188 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6031189 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6031190 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6031191 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6031192 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6031193 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6031194 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6031195 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6031196 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6031197 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6031198 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6031199 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6031200 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6031201 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6031202 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6031203 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6031204 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6031205 who are open to doing something on the production side
6031206 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6031207 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6031208 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6031209 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6031210 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6031211 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6031212 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6031213 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6031214 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6031215 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6031216 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6031223 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6031224 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6031225 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6031226 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6031230 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6031231 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6031232 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6031233 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6031234 anytime a 14 year old is killed over something that i would consider petty its disappointing its disheartening and it angers me
6031235 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6031236 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6031296 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6031297 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6031298 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6031299 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6031300 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6031301 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6031302 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6031303 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6031304 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6031305 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6031306 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6031307 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6031308 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6031309 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6031310 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6031311 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6031312 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6031313 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6031314 kind words are like honey they cheer you up and make you feel strong
6031315 super mom has left the building being a proverbs 31 woman in a 21st century world
6031316 ive learned by now to be quite content whatever my circumstances
6031317 whats the sense when we dont even know if hes going to play yet
6031318 hes a good player and it certainly doesnt hurt to look
6031319 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6031320 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
6031321 the marketplace of ideas does not work when we have gag orders imposed on our scientists
6031322 now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings
6031323 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6031324 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6031325 the whole concept of tipping is insane it is insane everywhere in the world being established for a long time does not make it more sane so personnaly i really dont see the need for this to be exported to places where it does not exist
6031326 eles se respeitam muito e est o muito emocionados com o encontro um momento importante para a hist ria da m sica nacional

6031343 leo abse was small in stature but he was an intellectual giant
6031344 he was a great parliamentarian who championed the rights of his constituents for nearly 30 years with a passion and tenacity that left its mark on the borough and right across the uk through significant legal reform
6031345 over the years weve had hundreds of people work on the game and we thank everyone who helped us bring our warhammer passion to life but only current employees that have continued until the end will be credited in the final game

6031353 coming from a person occupying the responsible post of a minister in a state the remark is deplorable and should be condemned by all the remark should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should tender an unqualified apology to the people of bihar
6031354 though the ministers unwarranted remark has not not lowered our respect for the state or its people it merits to be denounced and an apology from naik would be in place biharis are not not beggars but have earned respect and status and done our state proud through sheer merit and hard work
6031355 it is true we have been affected by waterlogging for over a week
6031356 water is everywhere it is more on the roads but has also entered inside the institute
6031357 it is difficult to leave and enter the campus as the entire locality is submerged
6031358 around 500 acres near bihta about 30 km from here would be acquired for the permanent campus

6031361 there are tax cut activists around the country who are very interested in what were doing here
6031362 if it does well we may see copycat initiatives in 2010 and 2012 across the country

6031370 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
6031371 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
6031372 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
6031373 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious

6031398 we are about halfway between determining if we can release you or if we will admit you overnight for observation

6031401 ive had with my car ive had some wheels that were bent and damaged
6031402 hes a player weve known about for a while and weve become aware he might be available
6031403 hes a pacy winger which is something we havent got
6031404 he had a work out with the lads and looked very quick
6031405 its difficult to say how he would do in games because its different playing in the premier league than it is in russia
6031406 this creates a double positive because it allows furnishaid to raise money for their charitable work whilst also making
6031407 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
6031408 uses a range of approaches to help advance solutions within our five initiatives we operate in a traditional manner by supporting our partners work with targeted grants but we can also invest in for profit endeavors such as efforts by companies to develop breakthrough renewable energy technologies our structure also allows us to lobby for policies that support our philanthropic goals additionally we can tap googles innovative technology and most importantly its inspired workforce weve already begun to donate and invest google orgs funds and we expect to continue to do so in the future
6031409 egs produces heat and electricity by harnessing the energy from hot rock deep below the earths surface expanding the potential of traditional geothermal energy by orders of magnitude
6031410 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6031411 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal

6031414 per jaar komt nu n op de twintig koopwoningen in nederland vrij voor de verkoop voor woningzoekenden is dus steeds minder aanbod beschikbaar ook al omdat het aanbod van nieuwbouwwoningen achterblijft bij de vraag
6031415 omdat er te weinig huizen beschikbaar zijn kost een volgende woning mensen vaak een paar ton meer dat is een gigantische investering
6031416 deze is toch 6 procent dat tikt aan op huizen met prijzen van twee of drie ton

6031419 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6031420 perhaps companies will want to put wind farms atop our bridges and skyscrapers
6031421 i think weve got to be careful in not automatically saying things cant work
6031422 in my experience some clinicians continue to prescribe brand name b vitamin supplements to cardiac patients at a cost of hundreds of dollars annually this practice can no longer be justified
6031423 many of them have been trying to contact the party leadership for a couple of days but the party leaders have their reservations
6031424 the opening of the redbridge centre could not have happened at a better time this being londons summer of cycling
6031425 one of my key ambitions as mayor is to see london become a real cycling city by encouraging the estimated 1 1 million londoners who own bikes but dont use them regularly to get back in the saddle
6031426 so now theres no excuse because its a superb facility and if you dont own a bike theyll lend you one just turn up and pedal
6031427 five years ago i was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer
6031428 so what was i supposed to do my consultant told me that exercise would help me so i started cycling everywhere i couldnt have looked my family in the eye had i just done nothing the more i cycled the more my test results improved so i just kept going

6031434 lunch should not be skipped for both employee health and productivity
6031435 workers are worried about what people will say if they take too long on their break
6031436 the biggest thing employers can do for productivity is encourage lunch workers tend to have a lot more energy if they take a break meaning theyre more on the ball for the afternoon stretch
6031437 you will find youre getting more work done than if you didnt break at all
6031438 workers tend to go home feeling energised and are less likely to lounge around and snack if theyve had a boost in the middle of the day
6031439 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day and one that well never forget
6031440 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world

6031445 est faltando apenas vencer fora de casa neste brasileiro precisamos fazer fora o mesmo que em nosso est dio para conseguirmos uma seq ncia de vit rias estamos fazendo o dever de casa e vamos buscar os pontos fora para recuperar as primeiras posi es da tabela
6031446 estamos devendo um pouco aos torcedores se estivemos em melhor situa o tenho certeza que o p blico seria melhor mas precisamos deles principalmente nesse momento
6031447 espero que ela venha s que o grande problema desse ano que o time est mudando muito ano passado nossa defesa por exemplo era muito definida em 2008 est mais complicado arrumar o time mas ainda espero a arrancada
6031448 n s n o podemos tomar gol um gol logo no in cio far com que nossa equipe v pra cima e a o contra ataque do s o paulo mortal o borges um jogador muito r pido temos que ter cuidado tranq ilidade e frieza procurar n o tomar o gol e no momento certo tentar faz lo

6031450 the u va team hypothesizes that feeding the algae more carbon dioxide and organic material could boost the oil yield to as much as 40 percent by weight
6031451 published evidence of improved algae oil output might spur significant follow up efforts by public and private sectors since the fundamentals of this technology are so appealing
6031452 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix

6031485 ik ben niet zo handig op de computer en het was nogal een gedoe dat formulier in te vullen ik heb er geen prioriteit aan gegeven als ik het nu niet tien dagen na terugkomst uit peking alsnog doe krijg ik een waarschuwing ik ga het thuis wel regelen
6031486 mijn vrouw krijgt die brief thuis op het moment dat ik in peking net de finale van de 100 vrij heb gehaald mensen moeten dan toch weten dat ik hier ben
6031487 weve got to get a win as quick as we can

6031489 i still think we need a little bit of experience but were working every day to bring in players
6031490 one or two might have to leave thats the way budgets go at football clubs but weve had two or three lads down on our wanted list

6031493 this is an exciting opportunity for more wetland creation in cheshire
6031494 we are delighted to see the ditcher in the county and it is great that these farmers have been willing to use it on their land
6031495 the stewardship scheme will fund the work but the involvement of the farmers is crucial
6031496 we contacted mr biscardi who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process we set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer
6031497 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
6031498 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6031499 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6031500 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such

6031509 teemu went on international duty but was sent back he has a muscle strain and hell be a doubt for saturday
6031510 i had three players on the shopping list its gone up to four after the weekend
6031511 waggy picked up an injury on sunday and hell be out for 10 weeks he just hurt his knee in a block tackle with kav graham kavanagh straight away you could tell it was a bad one
6031512 this has gone through with west brom and we are very pleased he said
6031513 there has been no further contact with any club regarding benni mccarthy and roque santa cruz he said
6031514 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not negotiate
6031515 next summer we will sort out the situation if people can show some sense
6031516 it is disappointing as you want to play for your country but hopefully if i can keep working hard i will get another chance
6031517 you dont normally get results like this when argentina face brazil he said
6031518 we played a great game and above all showed character and intelligence we had to be patient because they were always going to wait for us to come at them
6031519 we were superior in every area of the pitch and thats why we won i always said that with these 18 players id fancy our chances to win anything and the way they outplayed a great side like brazil explains why
6031520 in games like these the team that scores first always has a great advantage they rocked us back with the opening goal and then we had to go out in search of the equaliser i have to admit they played very well
6031521 now that weve lost well have to accept this defeat with our heads held high when we arrive home doubts will be cast about my team and i after this defeat but well stick to our ideals and keep going forward
6031522 we had bigger expectations for this game we knew that we were going to be playing a very strong team who possess great strength and great speed but they caused us too many problems in the opening 30 minutes
6031523 after that we had chances and i thought that we were the better team but then they scored the second which made life very difficult for us and after that they controlled the rest of the game i think they have a great chance to win the tournament now we must target the bronze medal
6031524 i believe this team is progressing all the time we took our chances on the counter attack but still maintained our defensive focus he said
6031525 we played well in the quarter final but we played wonderfully well in the semi
6031526 were just going to make sure that we play well in the final and were going to do all we can to claim the gold medal i dont want to compare this team with the 1996 winners this group are younger but we have great players
6031527 historically special importance as been attached to the power to fix the locations of events places and phenomena on the surface of the earth and to represent these on maps
6031528 there might be a few more people on every flight but were not going to notice
6031529 weve had larger conventions when the shriners come they bring 50 000 people
6031530 there are fewer people about 32 000 but there are no evening events so all those people are in area restaurants and out in the city
6031531 in a three week period we will have had more people in denver than ever before
6031532 we knew this would be a busy year and we started building staffing at the beginning of the year

6031548 we look forward to lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6031549 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6031550 i played for the national team from 14 years old until the under 21s and when i see all the boys coming through from that side i want to get involved as well
6031551 i always played with wesley sneijder rafael van der vaart and robin van persie
6031552 it wasnt difficult to see them progress because i knew i wasnt ready for it
6031553 the world turns we all become dogs in the end
6031554 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6031555 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win

6031572 i dont know if the grime scene faithful will be too happy about it
6031573 but it says something worrying about the self confidence of black british music that hes had to hook up with calvin harris to get it

6031585 i dont know how many times were going to say no
6031586 i think if you get the kind of reforms that im talking about then it might be a good trade off
6031587 what im trying to tell them is the only way we can solve the problem is a compromise
6031588 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6031589 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
6031590 it does not say a word about how it all began and why it had all happened
6031591 they are trying to turn the aggressor into a victim to whitewash the criminal regime they are trying to save the regime that has failed
6031592 the united states got precisely what it sought in this statement
6031593 very tough statement that the russian president ought to keep his word
6031594 the objectives of this offensive suggest russian intention to weaken and subjugate georgia
6031595 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
6031596 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
6031597 theres a clear expression of propaganda in detriment to serious important political work which needs to be done in the security council
6031598 it will be measured against how effectively georgia fulfills its obligation to return its troops to their permanent bases and how peacekeeping forces are being deployed in the security zone
6031599 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
6031600 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
6031601 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
6031602 i have not seen the heimlich maneuver now in over 20 years i couldnt see well or tell if he was injured by the fall
6031603 who was sitting at a table in the dayroom playing cards
6031604 he was proudest of the work he did on that church
6031605 ansel adams photo was taken a long time ago and that is what he used to replicate it
6031606 i think his grandfather was a huge influence on his life
6031607 he spent so much time with someone who was born in the 1800s
6031608 people all around this part of the county would come to him for things they couldnt do
6031609 ive had several women tell me how they loved it when gary said boy you sure are pretty
6031610 twenty five years ago it would have made me insanely jealous but now i think its wonderful that he made people feel that way
6031611 we are trying to take back our supervisors from those who have given it to the business interests and developers
6031612 and there are other ways to balance our budget instead of on the backs of you
6031613 we wont be able to get the best and brightest workers in the future
6031614 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
6031615 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
6031616 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6031617 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6031618 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6031619 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6031620 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6031621 he refused to board the plane last night and now is being confined at the transit lounge we will not allow him to enter the country
6031622 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6031623 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
6031624 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6031625 it makes you sick he doesnt even want to live here hes just coming to sponge off us i can think of a lot more worthy people to give treatment to on the nhs
6031626 hes an exploiter he exploits children hell exploit the nhs
6031627 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6031628 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6031629 now we are talking and he seems to be in a great mood laughing and enjoy ing chatting with our negotiators
6031630 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6031631 understanding user intent being able to analyze queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
6031632 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
6031633 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
6031634 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
6031635 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
6031636 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
6031637 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
6031638 he was going to project a message that said free tibet and some other messages that would have been three stories high in different locations in beijing
6031639 i have a real tough time dealing with that one
6031640 if they actually let him go that means hes going to be dealing with people every day who have no idea not even a clue as to what he did and i dont think thats right
6031641 i believe he is eminently suitable for an outpatient program at this time
6031642 theres no reason to believe hed pose a risk to anyone while under supervision in the community
6031643 i have no doubt he was psychotic at the time of the event and the days leading up to it
6031644 but the psychosis all but disappeared at his arrival at jail
6031645 i dont get it we just brought out the cakes and poof mass hysteria
6031646 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6031647 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6031648 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years

6031656 four years ago we came to hamilton and we were instantly attracted to the area
6031657 were excited to expand our stake here we will work with the residents of miry run to make all necessary upgrades and enhance the property for everyone
6031658 over the years the federal government has not done anything for the development of the area since the discovering oil in the area
6031659 god knows why he deposited that resources there and even their leaders have not been helping matters at all they keep on conniving with those who are against the cause of the people
6031660 if they had taken care of the people since this problem we are facing now in the region would not have been and if not addressed soonest it will degenerate into something the fg will not be able handle
6031661 if the fg likes let them gather all the weapons in this world to fight them they will fail because god is on the side of niger delta people
6031662 unanimous in wanting the fields to reopen but differed on the standards state or federal guidelines that should be followed said board member raymond wiss
6031663 after learning what the federal agency had said i now think its safe she said
6031664 he had a huge input but so did the club
6031665 the club steered him in the development of the course they both rejected plans from each other and changed the layout quite a bit but the needs of the club and his creative side were perfect for each other
6031666 he used the land so well he would look at the topography and build a golf hole from it
6031667 tillinghast was one of the most creative architects in the history of the game
6031668 at ridgewood he really implemented the shot options with the way he protected the greens with bunkers
6031669 the plan which is illustrated provides for every shot in the bag explosion and deft pitches from sand pits included
6031670 but it is best that the green be used only for approaches from the varying lengths i am pleased to call this plan the ridgewood
6031671 he needed a club that would be very patient with him and let him be creative
6031672 so i think they were a really good team in that respect and they ended up with a great product
6031673 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6031674 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6031675 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6031676 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6031677 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6031678 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
6031679 tout ce blanc par terre cest joli mais cest froid et ca rentre
6031680 we cannot forget the crimes he has committed against the nation
6031681 no vi el r cord hasta dar la vuelta de honor
6031682 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
6031683 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it

6031685 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important
6031686 theres more infections all the time and the number of donors is more and more limited
6031687 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
6031688 es kommt vor dass autofahrer aus bestimmten regionen aufgrund ihres kennzeichens mit vorurteilen belegt sind und probleme im stra enverkehr haben
6031689 die abschaffung der ortsziffern auf dem nummerschild ist daher zu berdenken
6031690 the only option that theyve offered is a refund which is useless at this point since the tickets are twice as expensive as they were when i purchased them
6031691 delta is claiming their codeshare partner changed the schedule and that theyre under no obligation to offer us new travel dates unless the partner airline has tickets with the exact same fare code
6031692 regardless of the outcome our agents shouldnt be telling a customer to call the carrier
6031693 her first choice would be a united codeshare flight and if they are unwilling to budge on that a refund

6031971 junior doctors are the people in hospitals most likely to prescribe medication and they are also the most likely to make errors in prescribing
6031972 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
6031973 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel
6031974 we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
6031975 we developed a safe prescribing training program that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2007
6031976 parts of our program have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
6031977 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally
6031978 no other country in the world has such a system of standardised charts and we are hoping to share our work around the world
6031979 while we will never eradicate mistakes completely these developments have seen a significant drop in prescribing errors
6031980 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
6031981 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas

6031984 underscores the need for comprehensive health care reform as the governor has outlined
6031985 this is a very important advance for the understanding and treatment of fragile x syndrome and paves the way for early identification and early intervention for these children
6031986 identification of the condition in early infancy will allow families to seek crucial early intervention services for their children that we hope will mitigate the disabling affects of the disorder
6031987 once we have identified the affected infants we will propose treatment options for them and also will assess the genes impact on other family members in many instances families may not even know that the gene exists
6031988 this will allow us to also look at a larger group of extended family members and the effects that the mutation may cause

6031993 i think this is just the beginning for this kind of technology
6031994 the silver polymer coating will most likely be applied also to tracheostomy tubes and also become available for use in pediatric medicine in the future we could see other types of coatings with other functions placed on devices that come into contact with the body
6031995 the new recommendation from the smc is to be welcomed new data supporting the role of versatis in post herpetic neuralgia will further establish that such a novel non systemic treatment approach offers significant benefits in the older patient group who suffer co morbidities and consequential polypharmacy
6031996 the smc is to be congratulated on its revised decision for versatis theyve taken a huge step forward in extending options for pain relief for people living with neuropathic pain this decision will alleviate a lot of suffering

6032020 it often goes unrecognized that torture is not something of the past but is in fact very much a part of our world today it is carried out in more than 100 countries and is a tool used to break a human being down it is the cruelest and yet most effective instrument of power in our world
6032021 i urge those countries who have not yet signed up to the uncat to do so and i call on all ratifying countries to do as they preach to implement the convention effectively in their national legislation and to follow it
6032022 the torture victim is the loneliest person in the world furthermore torture never solves problems but instead creates hatred for these reasons i am extremely passionate about my fight against it and trying to help those who have suffered pain at the hands of torture is simply the most rewarding work i can do
6032023 dr genefke has worked tirelessly to campaign against the use of torture and to help those who have fallen victim to both the mental and physical pain it can cause it is because of her work that we are able to not only understand the true effect that torture has on people but also that it remains widespread throughout the world today this year iasp is delighted to honour dr genefke with the special prize for lecturers at the 12th world congress on pain and we wish her the very best of luck with her deserving nobel peace prize nomination

6032064 la treintena de representantes de colectivos sociales en la comisi n de las fiestas lustrales 2008 han decidido no asumir el excesivo coste de una actividades que a su juicio no iban a tener trascendencia social una decisi n que nosotros como gobernantes suscribimos en su totalidad

6032066 que me expliquen c mo es posible por ejemplo que se pretendiera pagar 21 000 a una persona por poner en contacto a los grupos que iban a actuar con la organizaci n de las lustrales eso es algo que la situaci n econ mica del ayuntamiento y de las fiestas no nos permite afrontar hay que ser consecuentes con la realidad actual y no estar haciendo castillos en el aire sobre todo porque lo que est en juego es dinero p blico de los ciudadanos de san sebasti n y hay que gestionarlos con sentido com n
6032067 la cuesti n es sencilla se ala castilla no hay contratos firmados es decir todo est o estaba en el aire y lo que no vamos a hacer es asumir dispendios gratuitos de dinero p blico y si alg n productor o artista se siente perjudicado que ejercite sus derechos ante la administraci n de justicia pero nosotros queremos hacer las cosas bien y que quienes participen en las lustrales 2008 cobren por su trabajo al amparo de la legislaci n vigente y no por acuerdos verbales que no son vinculantes para la administraci n p blica y que se prestan a interpretaciones personales y chanchullos varios

6032220 its my dream im not planning to be another hulk but i want my muscles toned
6032221 since tob has strong interest in the sport and he is a well build i believe that he stands a great chance to join the national team
6032222 but it is not uncommon in this sport to compete with three members weve lost a strong one but one of our closest opponents are in the same position
6032223 we had the pressure of a three man squad and also of wearing the flag but we also had all the support from our canadian fans as well
6032224 ive been riding on the team for 39 years and a lot of good things have happened but the olympics have never quite gone my way
6032225 this is remarkable for me i cant say enough about our great team and horses and our chef dequipe torchy millar and all the people in canada who are behind us we had great synergy
6032226 these games are coming together just the way we planned

6032229 what a remarkable way to kick off this region wide campaign
6032230 we are honoured to be here today and thankful that we are able to support an organization that makes our communities a better place for all of us
6032231 for the last six months our volunteer cabinet of 22 business leaders from the regions leading companies have met at united way funded programs across the region a classroom at the welcome centre in vaughan to a markham drop in program for homeless youth
6032232 we have seen the impact every donation to united way of york region makes the first race started out as an even affair but fm global inferno gradually took control of things we have analyzed the statistics of unprecedented growth in municipalities across york region we are committed to keeping our region vital with a strong social service network for all residents
6032233 its counselling for a family in crisis its employment training for a laid off father its a day program for a son with developmental and intellectual challenges or food and shelter for a newcomer family unable to make ends meet our commitment to raise more each year is always and only to ensure that we are able to invest more in local services and keep apace with the rapid growth and constantly changing face of our communities

6032248 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6032249 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6032250 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6032251 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6032252 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6032253 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6032254 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6032255 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6032256 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6032257 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6032258 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border

6032699 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6032700 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6032701 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6032702 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6032703 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6032704 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6032705 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
6032706 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6032707 most people think they are automatically covered but the amount of lemon law coverage you have might depend on the number of wheels you have four wheels youre probably covered three probably not two wheels its 50 50 a lot states dont cover motorcycles
6032708 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering

6032710 paddocks round thallon and talwood southern queensland were looking quite good but ive heard as much as two thirds of some paddocks in central queensland may have been frost affected
6032711 so its fingers crossed for the moment because it can take between a week and 10 days for frost damage to show up
6032712 im not sure how substantial it is but there are definite reports of some levels of frost damage
6032713 the winter has certainly been colder than average and a bit longer than average
6032714 the yield of early sown crops that escape frost can be 20 50pc more than crops sown at the recommended time
6032715 however only one frost event can be enough to destroy a crop
6032716 those people who believe we are responsible for climate change would say from their models that this should be happening less often because this part of the northern hemisphere should be getting dryer
6032717 it validates the belief we had 10 years ago or more that sports fans are not just enjoying sports on television
6032718 if i was holding the auction i would definitely want to hold it after this olympics
6032719 it just came away from the wall because it had been fitted with the wrong types of screw it had been put up with tiny ones instead of large ones
6032720 it knocked me down at 10pm and it was only when the man from the meals and wheels service came round at noon the following day that i was able to get any help

6032723 the punjabi dialogues songs and dances went against the film the bihar distributor paid a whopping amount of money to buy singh is kinng and is now going to lose a hefty amount
6032724 ive heard that the punjabiyat and sikh theme have gone against the films success in bihar but i dont understand why we were aware that some areas would reject the films usp namely the sikh ambience surprisingly the film has done extremely well even in bengal where we thought the audience wouldve trouble connecting with the theme theres really no explanation for what has happened to singh is kinng in bihar
6032725 but jab we met didnt thrust the bhangra culture down audiences throats like it or not the rest of the country is not as fond of punjabi culture as bollywood

6032729 one of the decisions taken by grameen bank is to eradicate dowry so we issued housing loans to women on a condition that the land on which the house is going to be built has to be owned by them so to get the loan husbands transferred ownership of the land to the wife and she became the owner of the property this has also reduced divorce as most of the men fear being sent out of the house that they no longer own

6032750 john mccain says he has a list of about 20 names of potential vice presidential candidates i dont want to say john mccain is old but the list begins hear ye hear ye
6032751 people dont think that ageism is important like racism or sexism
6032752 just to say hes too old based on the fact that hes 71 years old its unfair and wrong and ageist
6032753 ageism takes shape in stereotypes and myths outright disdain and dislike sarcasm and scorn subtle avoidance and discriminatory practices older persons are subject to physical emotional social sexual and financial abuse they are the focus of prejudice regarding their capacity for work and sexual intimacy
6032754 the polls do show more people are concerned about his age than are concerned about obamas race

6032756 what if you just substituted the word black or a woman theyd be pulled off the air
6032757 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6032758 no single crash test provides a full picture of a vehicles crashworthiness
6032759 unsere aufw ndige spiele entwicklung auf basis einer derart zugkr ftigen lizenz zu entwickeln erm glicht uns rollenspielern nicht nur ein sehr gutes sondern ein herausragendes rpg zu liefern unser ansporn besteht darin mit dem dsa projekt neue massst be in puncto storytelling grafik sowie spielwelt zu setzen
6032760 mit simon the sorcerer 5 wollen wir die grosse erwartungshaltung der genre fans nicht nur erf llen sondern weit bertreffen
6032761 in front you are punching the hole in the air and whats created behind you is drag a vortex of air which means you have less effort to put in but your front wheel has to be within a foot of the rear wheel of the rider in front
6032762 the bigger the group youre riding in the bigger benefit you will derive even more than 30 in a large group
6032763 but in terms of recreational cyclists we dont want people falling off because they are riding too close
6032764 people must pay attention to traffic and road junctions but you do see some commuters riding into work who may be more experienced riding together and riding behind one another
6032765 what cyclists need to think about is trying to create power through the full cycle if possible not just pushing down most bikes now come with a pedal clip and a toast rack and can produce a more even spread of power
6032766 the foot clicks in like on a ski and the ball of the foot should be on the central axis of the pedal the toast rack means a strap can pull a bit tighter on the foot
6032767 theres an optimum gear to use depending on your speed and conditions a headwind or tailwind up and downhill feel is very important and practice
6032768 standing up means you can change your position its more effort but when youre starting to feel uncomfortable you can stand up usually when riding uphill some people prefer to sit down and pedal and they could be more effective doing that
6032769 the track cyclists and sprinters look behind while in front to look for any move and to make sure they dont miss anything even at that level the golden rule of cycling of looking behind them is a great skill to acquire
6032770 if youre going off on a bike ride at the weekend spend a bit of time planning where youre going birmingham like many councils produces a map of the city with all the bike paths cycle friendly roads all the parks that have cycle paths
6032771 its very easy for 10 or 15 minutes to come up with a route thats more fun or way into work that avoids the dual carriageways
6032772 people behind the likes of rebecca romero develop the technology and then brands like endura and polaris buy a licence to use it to produce a product and as the technology moves on the price does come down
6032773 theres nothing worse than doing a five mile cycle ride in a pair of jeans especially when its hot or raining the advantage to wearing proper gear is that you can cycle in any weather and it dries very quickly but cycle to work in a pair of jeans and you will be wet all day

6032785 we want to pay tribute to the nominees and the nordic films
6032786 quite possibly one or more of the films will not have been shown at cinemas in the five nordic countries now the movie audiences will get a chance to see all nominated films and so make up their own opinions before the winner is announced 15 october
6032787 using english at their meetings is completely out of the question it is incompatible with the very concept of nordic co operation
6032788 and since understanding neighbouring languages is not a priority in the nordic education systems youngsters find it increasingly necessary to communicate in english so they are able to understand each other at all
6032789 language is an important part of the common nordic culture and a key to understanding rather than a barrier

6032796 this keeps the price low i can try different perfumes some not available locally and i hide them in a box in a dresser drawer freeing uncluttering the top of my dresser
6032797 what we do is spray pour or use sterile pipettes to take perfume from its original large bottle and repackage it in a smaller bottle we only use brand new sterile glass bottles so that the consumer can try as many fragrances as they desire before buying a full bottle
6032798 superior content appealing across customer segments and regions with highest levels of customer service at prevailing price points are the pillars of our strategy to become the largest home entertainment service in first year of launch subscription video on demand would redefine pay per view market in the country by making premium content affordable and accessible at click of a button
6032799 the home entertainment market in india has a huge appetite for movies which has been hugely underserved till date big tv dth would address this huge latent demand by offering 600 new movies every year at fully digital picture and sound experience big tv dth is undoubtedly the best value proposition for home entertainment service for the 120 million indian tv households
6032800 the launch of big tv dth is amongst the largest retail rollout of a home entertainment service in the world and larger than the brand rollouts of many fmcg and consumer durable brands in india

6032827 i dont think hes trying to hide anything hes proud of the few gray hairs he does have when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
6032828 its an absolute benefit for him gray hair helps because it makes people look like theyre older and in his case he needs it
6032829 it has nothing to do with stress it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life

6032840 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting
6032841 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6032842 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting

6032856 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars

6032858 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence
6032859 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
6032860 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
6032861 we have got to convince people this can be done and it would be good economics
6032862 there should be one state to prove you could do it and it should be you

6032865 we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenceless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan

6033113 hess kennedy itself really wasnt a debt settlement business model
6033114 what it was was essentially a law firm holding itself out to consumers as the end all save all for all their financial problems
6033115 i want my 14 000 something whatever the total is back its not right
6033116 we are trying to find legislative remedies and we are going to continue litigating against people who take advantage with unfair deceptive practices this is something we are not going to stand for

6033128 it may look like a disaster for baa but i think its something they can live with and ultimately it may prove to be to their benefit heathrow doesnt really compete with gatwick or stansted its a global player and this will focus minds on improving passenger services to win back customers from other international airports
6033129 the commission proposes the divestiture of two of baas london airports
6033130 guidelines mean that it is unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6033131 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6033132 there isnt enough competition at u k airports in particular gatwick and heathrow
6033133 there arent enough incentives at the moment for baa to improve their level of customer service and the prices they charge
6033134 one of the criticisms that baa has faced was that they didnt provide enough capacity but simply splitting the owners doesnt necessarily mean three new runways in the southeast
6033135 splitting up the ownership isnt going to solve the capacity issue

6033149 we like to do things a bit diverse on sundays all the children have been really enjoying the chess club and one lad even came in beforehand and ordered a chess book in preparation for the day
6033150 some of the people who came along had never played before we even had a tiny tot come along who was no more than three years old

6033157 it has been such a battle for sarah just getting to the games
6033158 she was made homeless on the monday before she went to germany on the thursday to get the a standard time she needed to qualify
6033159 she was sharing a flat in london with her boyfriend when the owners decided they needed it back and kicked them both out
6033160 when she came back her coach lloyd managed to find her a room in a house just two doors down from where dwain chambers lives
6033161 being kicked out and being told she had to get the time again made her so mad and she used that anger in germany to qualify
6033162 i told her before the final to remember that anger and channel that aggression and she did
6033163 i even had to find the 61 for her train ticket from london to loughborough so she could race and get the time she needed but she did it
6033164 i would quite like her to stick her fingers up to uk athletics and run for another country
6033165 the virgin islands wanted her to run for them but she stayed loyal even though they made it so hard for her to get there
6033166 i feel they just didnt want to select her but she worked so hard and put up with so much to get there
6033167 im so proud of my sarah she is an olympic finalist and they can never take that way from her
6033168 ever since she was nine years old she has wanted this and we want to thank all the people who believed in her and supported her along the way there have been many who didnt but this is a big thank you for those who never stopped believing
6033169 this is an important moment in the project and will be a good opportunity to update everyone on progress so far and what will be happening over the next few months
6033170 we are very pleased with the way preparations have been going and everyone is looking forward to construction now

6033256 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6033257 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6033258 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6033259 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6033260 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

6033265 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6033331 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense
6033332 some said they are connected with the prime minister others said they are connected with higher authorities
6033333 nearly 45 percent of us mobile video users will watch the olympics on their handsets
6033334 we need to be clear that mobile media as a relevant business opportunity is hazy at best
6033335 no that is not true we have not pulled out of the champions trophy but we have advised the icc about our considerable concern and we have made sure that they understand that we will not go anywhere which is not safe we are waiting to hear from them later this evening
6033336 ca at this stage hasnt made any official decision to not tour we are waiting to hear from icc the ball is in their court
6033337 we are very willing to tour pakistan we are very keen to do so and we will visit pakistan as long as the safety and security advisors say that it is safe
6033338 mr president mr speaker members of the house and the senate distinguished americans here as visitors in this chamber as am i it is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech laughter
6033339 when presidents speak to congress and the nation from this podium typically they comment on the full range in challenges and opportunities that face the united states
6033340 let me begin by saying that it has been too long at least three decades since a president has come and challenged americans to join him on a great national journey not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow
6033341 like individuals nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live and later how they wish to be judged by history
6033342 we have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit
6033343 the conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well known two decades of low productivity growth and stagnant wages persistent unemployment and underemployment years of huge government deficits and declining investment in our future exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of americans legions of poor children education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough global economy
6033344 and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of our problems
6033345 i well remember 12 years ago president reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the american people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand dollar bills the stack would reach 67 miles into space
6033346 tonight i want to talk with you about what government can do because i believe government must do more
6033347 our immediate priority must be to create jobs create jobs now
6033348 well were in a recovery and we dont have to do that
6033349 to create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery i call on congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over 30 billion to put people to work now to create a half a million jobs jobs to rebuild our highways and airports to renovate housing to bring new life to rural communities and spread hope and opportunity among our nations youth
6033350 second our plan looks beyond todays business cycle because our aspirations extend into the next century
6033351 over the long run all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth improved productivity more high quality jobs and an improved economic competitive position in the world
6033352 the spending cuts i recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment
6033353 because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history
6033354 with a new network of community development banks and 1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south boston to south texas to south central los angeles
6033355 standing as we are on the edge of a new century we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade
6033356 at the same time and i say this to you in both parties and across america tonight all the people who are listening it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement
6033357 and again i will say we must do this together i pledge to you that i will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together for a change
6033358 but all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail let me say this again i feel so strongly about this all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year not next year not 5 years from now but this year bold steps to reform our health care system
6033359 in 1992 we spent 14 percent of our income on health care more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens
6033360 the combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people
6033361 later this spring after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either
6033362 let me further say that i want to work with all of you on this
6033363 perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction i propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our children
6033364 i recommend that the women infants and childrens nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it
6033365 we have to ask more in our schools of our students our teachers our principals our parents
6033366 we have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy
6033367 and finally i propose a program that got a great response from the american people all across this country last year a program of national service to make college loans available to all americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers to give them the option to pay the loans back but at tax time so they cant beat the bill but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge
6033368 a generation ago when president kennedy proposed and the united states congress embraced the peace corps it defined the character of a whole generation of americans committed to serving people around the world
6033369 if we believe in jobs and we believe in learning we must believe in rewarding work
6033370 later this year we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it
6033371 our next great goal should be to strengthen our families
6033372 and i ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart
6033373 let me say now we should move to the harder parts
6033374 i think it is clear to every american including every member of congress of both parties that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in washington is not high
6033375 believe me they were cheering that last section at home
6033376 this is your house this is your senate were your hired hands and every penny we draw is your money
6033377 next to revolutionize government we have to ensure that we live within our means and that should start at the top and with the white house
6033378 and thats why i also want to congratulate the congress i noticed the announcement of the leadership today that congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs i think that is important i think it will send a very clear signal to the american people
6033379 but if we really want to cut spending were going to have to do more and some of it will be difficult
6033380 next i recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts as you know and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as i have been
6033381 finally let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle it is not enough simply to cut government we have to rethink the whole way it works
6033382 so i want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department
6033383 in the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans we must use federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from making sensible loans
6033384 id like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs in the end we want people not to need us anymore i think thats important
6033385 but in the end we have to get back to the deficit
6033386 let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as i go around the country and whove asked it in the past were not cutting the deficit just because experts say its the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit
6033387 thats why weve got to reduce the debt because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the american people ought to be engaged in
6033388 if we dont act now you and i might not even recognize this government 10 years from now
6033389 this budget plan by contrast will by 1997 cut 140 billion in that year alone from the deficit a real spending cut a real revenue increase a real deficit reduction using the independent numbers of the congressional budget office
6033390 i did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers
6033391 as i said earlier my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the federal spending by a total of 246 billion
6033392 i have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs the time has come to show the american people that we can limit them too that we can not only start things that we can actually stop things
6033393 about the defense budget i raise a hope and a caution
6033394 i know this economic plan is ambitious but i honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the united states
6033395 for the wealthiest those earning more than 180 000 per year i ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent
6033396 for businesses with taxable incomes in excess of 10 million we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate also to 36 percent as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses
6033397 we will seek to ensure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporations who do make money in america simply pay the same taxes that american companies make on the same income
6033398 to middle class americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom i ask a contribution tonight i will say again as i did on monday night youre not going alone any more youre certainly not going first and youre not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past
6033399 let me be clear there will also be no new cuts in benefits for medicare
6033400 secondly the only change we are making in social security is one that has already been publicized
6033401 our plan does include a broad based tax on energy and i want to tell you why i selected this and why i think its a good idea
6033402 taken together these measures will cost an american family with an income of about 40 000 a year less than 17 a month it will cost american families with incomes under 30 000 nothing because of other programs we propose principally those raising the earned income tax credit
6033403 because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit if we do these things we will see the continuation of whats happened just since the election
6033404 i would also point out what the american people already know and that is because were a big vast country where we drive long distances we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country
6033405 now i ask all of you to consider this whatever you think of the tax program whatever you think of the spending cuts consider the cost of not changing
6033406 unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it were condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recessions to slow growth in jobs to no more growth in income to more debt to more disappointment
6033407 my fellow americans the test of this plan cannot be
6033408 pero lo m s importante es tener amigos que compartan los mismos valores las mismas aspiraciones y los mismos sue os y polonia y estados unidos son esa clase de amigos
6033409 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6033410 unfortunately the relationship has deteriorated from the promising situation it was in tonga to one that is disappointment and an uncertain future
6033411 as forum leaders we are very disappointed at the interim governments decision not to attend
6033412 he wasnt forced to set a date he agreed to it we are keen to help fiji move forward but fiji has to play its due part
6033413 he hasnt just gone one step too far hes gone many
6033414 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
6033415 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
6033416 black hats or white hats on the actors involved depending on whether they were allied with moscow or washington
6033417 a striking feature of the coverage was the ability of pundits who have enthusiastically advocated for u s invasions of sovereign countries dismissing concerns that these would violate international law to demand that russia be punished for breaking that same law by violating georgian sovereignty these commentators seemed blissfully unaware of the contradiction
6033418 to use force when dealing with any attempt to stage prison riots and to open fire shoot to kill and destroy any criminal who attempts to cause turmoil we will not spare bullets against these people

6033431 dan carter is the best tactical kicker in the world and we wanted to slow things down against the all blacks from the back but against the wallabies we think we should speed it up they have a lot of speed that needs to be countered too and also are not great tactical kickers
6033432 it is more a case of us as a team not being accurate in executing what we want to do we have been guilty of allowing the opposition to be ahead of our support players and we also have not been streetwise in our handling of the law in the contact situations
6033433 schalk has won a lot of ball for us in the past at the breakdowns and we back him to do the same against the wallabies he will come around maybe his recent neck injury was still in his head last week he is too good a player to be down for long
6033434 fourie has a yard or two on ricky but otherwise there is not much in it when you look at their games and that extra speed is what we have gone for
6033435 we have taken note that they have brought back a very good lineout specialist in dan vickerman for nathan sharpe who is very good in general play and in carrying the ball
6033436 the wallabies struggled a bit in the line outs against the all blacks in auckland which is why they have made the change vickerman will make it tough for us but we would hope that in andries bekker myself juan smith and pierre spies we have the firepower to disrupt them
6033437 there is pressure every week on a springbok team to win especially at home and having lost last week in a game we should have won it would be unforgivable to lose again
6033438 we honestly believe we had the winning of the game against the all blacks in a tight test match you usually get two or three opportunities to win the match the all blacks took theirs we did not
6033439 we made a number of line breaks but then did not make the right decision at the critical moment and also were guilty of not showing patience on the opposition line
6033440 playing for the boks is always about pride but apart from that there is still a chance that we can win the tri nations and so we will play very positive rugby to attempt to earn a try scoring bonus point

6033477 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6033478 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6033479 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6033480 presenting an academic paper would not violate computer fraud laws
6033481 you start off these games really any games with people recognizing a handful of athletes
6033482 so the viewers want and need to know about who these athletes are as people each night
6033483 must advance our storytelling without interrupting the pace of the broadcast
6033484 our prime time show is competition driven anytime we take our viewers away from the arena it must be for a very compelling reason
6033485 he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
6033486 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
6033487 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6033488 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6033489 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6033490 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
6033491 senator mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
6033492 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6033493 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are
6033494 there is no suggestion that she is guilty of taking drugs to enhance her performance or otherwise indeed this case can be viewed in all the circumstances as a busy young athlete being forgetful
6033495 i truly believe that i feel like the system was designed to catch cheats but caught a person with bad time management
6033496 why should this be spoilt it can be done only by someone who wants to spoil it im very happy with my performances and my three gold medals at three major championships including the commonwealth games
6033497 i believe there is a strong case for life bans for all dopers i dont want to hear about drugs i dont want to hear about cheaters most members of the team share that view i admire what great britain does you test positive and you cannot represent your country at the olympics i do think christine ohuruogu is fortunate to be here but her case is different she never had a positive test and to me she seems clean but i do think shes fortunate

6033525 aprovechar el encuentro para preguntarnos qu nos debemos los misioneros en el tema de salud y cu les son las responsabilidades compartidas que tenemos en mejorar nuestros indicadores se han realizado importantes inversiones en infraestructura hospitalaria nueva en la modernizaci n de las existentes y se ha reorganizado la estructura del financiamiento como lo demuestra la creaci n y puesta en marcha del seguro provincial de salud con recursos propios que es la nica cobertura existente bajo forma de seguro en la rep blica argentina
6033526 nuestro modelo sanitario tiene la fortaleza de la ley y de la b squeda permanente de la resoluci n de los conflictos con procesos de trabajo eso es lo que los misioneros podemos mostrar en el escenario nacional y latinoamericano se ha construido un modelo sanitario que estamos en condiciones de exhibir
6033527 el coi me acaba de comunicar que hay un positivo pendiente del resultado de la muestra b y ma ana habr una audiencia para tratar el caso
6033528 demuestra el efecto disuasorio del programa de controles de dopaje
6033529 no s lo por el resultado sino por el juego y la imagen lamentable que se dio
6033530 creo que cada uno a nivel particular debe hacer una autocr tica muy fuerte y pensar que lo que hicimos el a o pasado nos cost mucho trabajo y no podemos tirarlo de esa manera
6033531 ya contra el sevilla se vio al equipo muy carente de juego y de chispa ya fuimos inferiores ayer martes ante el valladolid hicimos una primera parte decente pero en la segunda parte cometimos errores que no pueden cometer un equipo de primera divisi n

6033533 seit seinem kinostart in den usa ist the dark knight auch bereits in mehreren europ ischen l ndern sehr erfolgreich angelaufen
6033534 nach dem rekordeinstieg in nordamerika sind unsere erwartungen auch f r den europ ischen kinomarkt entsprechend hoch wir gehen davon aus auch hier einige rekorde brechen zu k nnen
6033535 das ist aber von film zu film verschieden der au eramerikanische kinomarkt hat in den vergangenen jahren zudem zunehmend an bedeutung gewonnen
6033536 es ist jetzt unsere aufgabe bis zur wm 2010 die drei besten torh ter zu finden die t r ist f r jeden offen in alle richtungen
6033537 die aktuellen leistungen in der bundesliga und im europacup werden genau registriert
6033538 in front you are punching the hole in the air and whats created behind you is drag a vortex of air which means you have less effort to put in but your front wheel has to be within a foot of the rear wheel of the rider in front
6033539 the bigger the group youre riding in the bigger benefit you will derive even more than 30 in a large group
6033540 but in terms of recreational cyclists we dont want people falling off because they are riding too close
6033541 people must pay attention to traffic and road junctions but you do see some commuters riding into work who may be more experienced riding together and riding behind one another
6033542 what cyclists need to think about is trying to create power through the full cycle if possible not just pushing down most bikes now come with a pedal clip and a toast rack and can produce a more even spread of power
6033543 the foot clicks in like on a ski and the ball of the foot should be on the central axis of the pedal the toast rack means a strap can pull a bit tighter on the foot
6033544 theres an optimum gear to use depending on your speed and conditions a headwind or tailwind up and downhill feel is very important and practice
6033545 standing up means you can change your position its more effort but when youre starting to feel uncomfortable you can stand up usually when riding uphill some people prefer to sit down and pedal and they could be more effective doing that
6033546 the track cyclists and sprinters look behind while in front to look for any move and to make sure they dont miss anything even at that level the golden rule of cycling of looking behind them is a great skill to acquire
6033547 if youre going off on a bike ride at the weekend spend a bit of time planning where youre going birmingham like many councils produces a map of the city with all the bike paths cycle friendly roads all the parks that have cycle paths
6033548 its very easy for 10 or 15 minutes to come up with a route thats more fun or way into work that avoids the dual carriageways
6033549 people behind the likes of rebecca romero develop the technology and then brands like endura and polaris buy a licence to use it to produce a product and as the technology moves on the price does come down
6033550 theres nothing worse than doing a five mile cycle ride in a pair of jeans especially when its hot or raining the advantage to wearing proper gear is that you can cycle in any weather and it dries very quickly but cycle to work in a pair of jeans and you will be wet all day

6033553 nous avons voulu une intrigue clairement inspir e des productions hollywoodiennes
6033554 her public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6033555 this chair is a powerful visible symbol of roman catholic theology and in roman catholic theology abortion is disallowed
6033556 it appears to me that some right wing group has put pressure on the university
6033557 shes done seminal work on christian feminism social justice and the relationship between religion and ecology
6033558 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests
6033559 i mean how much more anti catholic can you get
6033560 rosemary ruether is like the godmother of the feminist theologian movement
6033561 its just criminal to disinvite her from the university of san diego
6033562 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
6033563 im openly gay and im teaching at a jesuit institution
6033564 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6033565 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts

6033572 going through hell basically living in hell and leaning on my family the opening ceremonies were great in sydney and i have a lot of friends in australia but other than that the experience was not very positive
6033573 that isnt tough to do but it was so cool to see my mom in action and being so aggressive down there she found a lab found a scientist found a lawyer i would have gone home they told me to go home but she found all these people and didnt sleep and she was like a lioness with her cubs she was just fighting for me and it was so stressful without her and my dad there i would not have played
6033574 athens was just a magical trip our venue was gorgeous friends and family were there we played great and won

6033610 wow i wish i could have been there for that sale
6033611 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work
6033612 this cat does extensive research i mean he puts in the kind of research that like james lipton would have his crew do on largehearted boy
6033613 i was interviewed by a very bright and engaging fellow
6033614 wow do i tell him things i wouldnt expect to say in an interview hes that good its the closest ive come to being on pamela ribon
6033615 very seldom do i get to say all these things because im not asked about them and i appreciate your asking
6033616 hes a funny smart guy and asked a lot of good questions
6033617 one of the great literary interviewers of our time listen for how often his subjects are struck by his discovery of an unknown to them pattern of imagery or tic of diction
6033618 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
6033619 i know who you are i know exactly what you do
6033620 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
6033621 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
6033622 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
6033623 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
6033624 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
6033625 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts

6033627 sarah este o actrita grozava intotdeauna mi a placut sa lucrez cu ea ea aduce ceva special si unic serialului si pune si personajul meu intr o lumina buna
6033628 pot sa zic doar ca sara a fost in mainile unuia dintre multele personaje negative din acest serial
6033629 dar e in continuare totul pe viata si pe moarte
6033630 imi place faptul ca avem in fine toti un scop comun

6033632 i think our team realizes that talent doesnt just win youve gotta have chemistry you cant build chemistry the players have to do that
6033633 we have over 2 000 customers and all of them buy and use cable and wire
6033634 adding these products to our portfolio will allow us to complement our existing range of connector products and offer our customers a total interconnect service that is experienced and efficient and is supported by our well known design support capability
6033635 we took great pains and a lot of math to look at different options and the cable did not come out favorably
6033636 if its economically viable why isnt the private sector making this investment
6033637 the idea is to communicate ideas not go on rants
6033638 im not going to tell you who it is because im meeting privately with people
6033639 as long as the member doesnt think i dont know how to run the power company
6033640 i dont think the town is going to run its own power company
6033641 i thought we put experts out there and youre asking us to solve your problems
6033642 you know what our charge is and were trying to do it in a way that harms no one
6033643 you guys have to step it up and try to help everyone not just the big businesses
6033644 all i do when you fight the electric cost is pay more on my electric bill
6033645 i just think its all about rate design and a lot of these costs are being pushed on the wrong people
6033646 caliphate or khilafah in arabic the organisation regards the caliphate as the ideal form of government which emerged from islam 1 400 years ago because it is government according to the laws of god as set out in the koran rather than by laws designed by man

6033652 the indian technical team has been in nepal for last several days to reinforce and strengthen the spurs and the embankment on the saptkoshi river in consultation with the local administration
6033653 despite repeated requests and pleas by the technical team for urgent local support in view of the gravity of the situation the support from local administration had not been forthcoming as a result the work was frequently delayed
6033654 at the same time the indian technical team was directed to carry out the work on day and night basis
6033655 the indian technical team mobilised required resources and has remained in readiness to carry out the required work to strengthen the embankment but it was prevented from reaching the site
6033656 as a result thousands of people in nepal and india have been forced to suffer a calamity that could have been avoided
6033657 while the indian technical team is ready to undertake protective measures this will become possible only if it receives necessary cooperation from the government of nepal and support from the local people
6033658 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medallists

6033660 comedy central and 3ball productions represent comedy on an all together different level and its great to be working alongside people creating such irreverent and edgy content reality bites back offers another new twist on competitive reality and has defied anyone who thought that this genre had reach maturity
6033661 reality bites back is a great edition to our mipcom slate its exactly what we look for in a comedy or entertainment show its both courageous and outrageous original and sophisticated in its sense of humour
6033662 with reality television having become so pervasive across the globe the time was ripe for a parody of the genre
6033663 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6033664 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6033665 youre no longer forced to be isolated from whats going on in your office with your clients or with friends or family for business travelers this will greatly aid productivity and for leisure travelers it means they will be in control of their entertainment

6033672 hoy por hoy estoy en el real madrid y mi futuro pasa por seguir aqu
6033673 nosotros estamos comprometidos as que esperamos hacer un gran partido y ganar la copa
6033674 en pretemporada hemos visto que est n a un gran nivel y que han recuperado la eficacia y la forma de jugar que ten an antes
6033675 se vislumbra un acontecimiento todo el mundo est contento y hay una gran expectativa
6033676 lo que se comenta en la calle es que todo el mundo se va para el cine ese d a hoy
6033677 no estoy pendiente de eso lo que me interesa es sentar otro tipo de precedente
6033678 estar metido dentro del g nero urbano y sacar a la vez una pel cula y una banda sonora de 15 canciones originales es algo hist rico porque no se hab a hecho nunca en el ambiente latino
6033679 ahora mismo estamos trabajando en las licencias con estados unidos para saber cu ndo se presentar la pel cula por ac
6033680 es una nueva faceta como digo en mis letras daddy yankee no es un cantante sino un movimiento
6033681 estoy buscando siempre reinventarme hacer cosas nuevas y ofrecerle al p blico algo no ha visto antes presentar un paquete completo con m sica y pel cula es la mejor muestra de ello
6033682 es una cosa distinta combina la m sica electr nica europea el hip hop el songo latino y el reggaet n
6033683 metemos cuatro g neros distintos en un solo tema y este ha tenido una gran aceptaci n en mi pa s porque se ha convertido en el n mero uno yo no me amarro a un solo estilo y esto demuestra mi versatilidad
6033684 soy una esponja recojo de todo tipo de m sica porque mi o do es internacional
6033685 me gustan mucho paul van dyk tiesto y bad boy bill
6033686 no puedo decir lo que voy a hacer en el futuro porque trabajo a trav s de la vibra
6033687 escucho un estilo musical que me gusta y lo puedo fusionar con mi onda urbana me gusta dejarme llevar por lo que me transmite la m sica en el momento creo que la mejor manera de hacer arte es guiarse por el coraz n
6033688 se trata de tomar decisiones personales y de evolucionar por cuenta propia
6033689 cuando salgo a la calle lo que m s se escucha son el reggat n y la bachata quieran aceptarlo o no
6033690 si la difusi n radial ha disminu do no es porque la m sica no d rating sino porque los auspiciadores no quieren ser identificados con este g nero por lo que las radioemisoras no logran vender los espacios
6033691 es una mentira que ha corrido por ah porque las ventas los conciertos y el apoyo de la gente se encargan de demostrar la verdad
6033692 y es algo que ocurre no s lo en puerto rico sino tambi n en sudam rica en centroam rica y en estados unidos
6033693 lo que pasa es que lamentablemente el g nero sufre una persecuci n constante hay algunos que lo quieren eliminar cuando no se puede eliminar al pueblo
6033694 es un vivo ejemplo del modo en que la gente favorece a una canci n a pesar de que no tiene difusi n radial porque se ha convertido en uno de los temas m s fuertes en mi show
6033695 me ha sorprendido mucho la recepci n que ha tenido
6033696 vengo de la calle y escribo de mis vivencias nunca he negado mis ra ces y mis ra ces se encuentran en el barrio la gente se identifica conmigo porque sabe que soy un l der del barrio
6033697 la gente siempre espera de m un tema tropical y este es un corte bien r tmico con mucha energ a
6033698 el arreglo fue trabajado por music logo que es mi productor y por elvis crespo que es uno de los merengueros m s grandes que existen
6033699 elvis es un tipo de lo m s creativo se sent con mi productor y los dos sacaron una bomba
6033700 hicieron un trabajo en conjunto que fue muy ch vere
6033701 fue un proyecto local en el que se me dio una oportunidad que no quise desaprovechar
6033702 me permiti darme cuenta de que ten a el potencial para ser actor y es por eso que decid hacer como protagonista talento de barrio una pel cula de la que soy tambi n productor ejecutivo conf o mucho en m y me gustan los retos
6033703 no es mi vida pero no deja de mostrar sucesos reales representados por actores del barrio que atravesaron situaciones parecidas
6033704 lo que se presenta es el pan de cada d a para los que vienen de la calle
6033705 ayuda al pueblo y considera que lo que est haciendo es justo porque no tiene otro modo de sobrevivir
6033706 pero l mismo se motiva para cambiar cuando descubre que tiene un talento muy especial y aunque logra hacerlo el pasado no lo deja escapar tan f cilmente
6033707 pero la pel cula no es un musical a pesar de que contiene mucha m sica
6033708 en este proyecto ten a todav a que tenderle un lazo a mi audiencia porque representa un paso de transici n voy a seguir actuando y llegar un momento en el que el p blico separar al daddy yankee actor del daddy yankee cantante
6033709 yo me refugi en la m sica para escapar de todo lo malo
6033710 estuve muy metido en la calle tuve mis altas y mis bajas y pas por momentos muy negros pero ahora soy un hombre con una nueva direcci n

6033726 like all excited fans of ac dc we can hardly wait for the launch of this album and all that will surround it
6033727 we will be responding to a simulated emergency so you can see how your firefighters will respond and see our proficiency
6033728 after our demonstration there will be time to check out our vehicles and equipment and interact with your firefighters
6033729 were looking for more to help take some of the workload off some of the folks we have now
6033730 the rewards are people thanking us profusely for saving the day as far as im concerned this is one of the best things ive ever done in my life weve had a ton of people that have said they really wished they did this years ago
6033731 this is our major event to allow our residents to see us in the their neighborhoods so we can demonstrate our proficiency interact with the residents all while we recruit new volunteers
6033732 unser gesamtes team ist in peking deshalb haben wir auch keinen moderator hier in deutschland

6033734 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6033735 there is proliferation of schools now there are many mushroom schools around even though we are still standing up on our feet the economy of the country is affecting us electricity is not stable so we cannot run our computers except with the aid of generators and diesel is now very expensive we have buses that convey children to and from school but the bad roads are affecting us because they make our vehicles to break down very often
6033736 i love children very much and i wanted to contribute my quota to education in nigeria i have brought children up morally and educationally who are now doing very well in their fields of endeavour
6033737 our students pass very well in external examinations national common entrance waec neco a and o levels and parents are happy with us my teachers also stay long some have stayed 25 to 28 years i have committed and dedicated teachers
6033738 in the course of periodic checks carried out by my office on the accounts of universities over the years one issue that has always been of concern to us is the diverse practices that we come across this influenced our interest in the issue of having a uniform accounting manual for the universities
6033739 in this era of information technology the need to computerise the accounting records has become expedient
6033740 the cost of the payment of the contiss is just n30million and the government has resorted to acts of blackmail and sacking of the workers which will not help it at the end of the day
6033741 what if i just die right now what would happen would she be able to stop the car even though im behnd the wheel
6033742 fans and friends have been asking me to produce an album that captures what ive been told is a totally fresh magical mix of r amp b and soul
6033743 from the moment i discovered my passion for poetry words and music ive known that i would eventually need to share it with audiences around the world this album does just that featuring four singles from my heart of hearts
6033744 the release of 4 showcases songs from the heart rooted in my past friends family and loved ones
6033745 each single sings with that gospel like sincerity yet its raw contemporary groove is anything but preachy or sappy my songs have a sexy smooth even coy feel with hints of madonna like influence but id say theyre more spiritual and inspiring from the beat to the lyrics the result is hypnotic deep and electric

6033769 weve all been told that school districts around the country are feeling the pinch from higher fuel costs whats never mentioned is that districts are supposedly suffering budget crunches despite spending more than twice as much in real inflation adjusted dollars as they did in 1970 according to the department of educations national center for education statistics districts spent an average of 5 247 per pupil in 1970 in 2008 dollars today the average is about 12 000 how is it possible that districts could have trouble covering higher gas prices when they have an extra 6 500 to spend per pupil one reason is that the public school bureaucracy has been doing what bureaucracies do best growing since 1970 total public school employment has nearly doubled to over 6 1 million people while total enrollment has increased by less than 9 percent

6033771 the percentage of consumers who have reduced the amount of time they spend in the shower over the past four years is minimal based on data we collected from the 2004 bathroom habits survey with conservation being even more top of mind with consumers today its surprising that they still spend approximately the same amount of time in the shower

6033853 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
6033854 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form

6033877 we won because of our togetherness hardwork and because the music our fans were playing in the stadium gave us power from god

6033879 all our players now are very young and have contributed a lot
6033880 this is one of our best performances during the olympic tournament
6033881 i didnt imagine that we would score like this it was such a big margin we are ready for gold
6033882 we havent achieved anything yet but beating brazil with a result like this is wonderful
6033883 there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6033884 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6033885 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details

6033895 we want to keep winning at home we have one more win than we had last year at home i dont think thats enough
6033896 of course we have those numbers in the back of our heads
6033897 the most important thing is winning well take it one half at a time score the goals we need to score and well do the job were getting closer to our point total with 10 games left so our goal is to eclipse that the wins will come well ride this wave and see what happens
6033898 we have 34 points now if we win the next game its very important we have the same points as last season with nine games left
6033899 im not focused on first second or third im just focused on the points what we talked about before the game is that by the end of next saturday vs rsl we want to have 37 points we want to have the same amount of points in 30 games last year then we can start adding some things on that
6033900 thats our goal if that puts us in first place great thats a great place to be and a reflection of what this team has done and what has worked for us we want to get more points and more points
6033901 the east is very strong and everyones starting to make the final push if you get 41 42 you should be all right but i dont want to say that and jinx it
6033902 if we get to maybe 43 points in the next in four games were in the playoffs
6033903 i want that little asterisk next to the columbus that says clinched a playoff spot
6033904 whether that happens when were in first place second place or third place doesnt matter to me as long as that asterisk gets next to our name as soon as possible
6033905 there are only four teams that have a winning record maybe five to be one of the few teams to have a winning record you have to remember mls is set up for everybody to go 500 thats the real prognosis of the league theyd like to see everybody 500 when youre above 500 that means youre doing something right
6033906 the difference between this year and last year is they can have a bad moment like that as i said to robert assistant coach warzycha when we were sitting there if we get in at halftime only down 1 0 thats good
6033907 we didnt get annihilated the first half even though we played poorly and we had the character to come back and get three points
6033908 every time you play the game youve got to figure out a way to win you have to figure out how to win when youre not playing well youve got to figure out how to win when youre playing well and when youre dominating games at houston two weeks ago i thought we were the better team and got nothing at colorado we probably got outplayed a bit and got something
6033909 will hesmer made some big saves to keep us in the game especially that 1v1 with cunningham we were lethargic
6033910 we had a great first half it almost felt like we were the home team we were unfortunate not to get more than one goal
6033911 what we tried to exploit was that we have two good strikers and we had victor sikora playing his first game for us on the left side
6033912 we tried to move the ball laterally we did not want the ball in the center of the field we wanted to get it in the middle and then move it out wide and we were finding a lot of success that way early in the game columbus had trouble shifting from one side to the other after overloading the side with the ball
6033913 it wasnt any one specific thing we didnt get out of the back we were too stretched on the field we didnt put pressure on their back four we werent stepping up to their midfielders in time we were too slow we didnt try to play the ball behind them at all those were all things we talked about at halftime
6033914 weve said this all year and we believe it one goal is nothing
6033915 obviously we dont want to give up that one goal but if thats what it takes to get guys fired up to come back and fight to the end ill take it a wins a win
6033916 i told robert warzycha that as long as we get in at 1 0 and dont get annihilated in the first half after playing so poorly we have the character to come back in the second half
6033917 the character of this team is great they listened to what we had to say at halftime they came out with more energy and were much more direct in their play we were able to stretch their defense and get in behind them as a result of that we created some chances and then the goals came
6033918 you know guillermos service is going to be great most of the time
6033919 cooper wasnt playing loose on me but he wasnt as tight i took advantage of that and got around him and the ball was perfectly placed it was a good finish and a good ball from guille
6033920 i hit it and then i hit adrian serioux and my hamstring cramped up i didnt see it hit the post but i thought i had it i want that one back so i can move it a few inches to the left
6033921 i dont know how many goals he scores but carroll scores a goal
6033922 and then evans scores a goal and i dont know how many goals he scores the guys we thought might score their goals didnt score goals
6033923 if we can get more goals out of the midfield were going to be so successful
6033924 go in there and tell those guys i want an easy one tell them to leave me unmarked so i can get a tap in or something

6033932 there are valid reasons for not voting for mccain none of which are listed on this site
6033933 the only point of this site unfitmccain com is that it says mccain and bush lied about their military service as if this has any bearing on their qualifications for president which it doesnt
6033934 run out of the military for trying to discredit other senior military officers and after he was outed for claiming and wearing medals he did not earn hardly a reliable source

6033942 both bush and mccain have done what you me havent served their country in time of war
6033943 there are valid reasons for not voting for mccain none of which are listed on this site
6033944 the only point of this site unfitmccain com is that it says mccain and bush lied about their military service as if this has any bearing on their qualifications for president which it doesnt
6033945 run out of the military for trying to discredit other senior military officers and after he was outed for claiming and wearing medals he did not earn hardly a reliable source
6033946 an individual who is more personally comfortable with blacks than with whites on an individual level need not hold political ideologies which support the separation of blacks and whites on a community level

6033955 mosquitoes use exhaled carbon dioxide body odors and temperature and movement to home in on their victims only female mosquitoes have the mouth parts necessary for sucking blood when biting with their proboscis they stab two tubes into the skin one to inject an enzyme that inhibits blood clotting the other to suck blood into their bodies they use the blood not for their own nourishment but as a source of protein for their eggs for food both males and females eat nectar and other plant sugars
6033956 the only silver lining to that cloud of mosquitoes in your garden is that they are a reliable source of food for thousands of animals including birds bats dragonflies and frogs
6033957 whether it was a war or an earthquake or men landing on the moon it would always come down to that
6033958 the cat will mew and dog will have his day

6033992 we are continuing long standing negotiations with alton towers to deliver the local communitys wish for a link road to take traffic serving the tourist destination out of the village
6033993 but the taxpayer cannot be expected to pick up the bill which is likely to exceed 15m the link should be a private road to serve the alton towers business
6033994 this latest tragedy has again highlighted the need for this investment and we will redouble our efforts to press the issue of behalf of the local community and the taxpayers of staffordshire
6033995 we have maintained an open dialogue with our parishes over this the bypass and have committed to give them an answer one way or the other by january 2009 which we intend to do
6033996 in reality the safety record of the roads around alton towers is very good certainly no worse than any other similar type of road in the country and we do not think that discussing the relief road in this context is appropriate or relevant
6033997 we have been trying for a bypass for over 20 years without success it is a very expensive project and it is a matter of the funding but we would very much like to see a bypass

6034040 just over two months ago ireland was instrumental in leading international efforts to secure a total prohibition on the use trade and production of cluster munitions and we are calling on the government to continue to show leadership on this issue by protesting to russia for its use of such deadly weapons

6034050 en lugar de retirarse los rusos quieren instalar puestos para controlar nuestros centros urbanos y carreteras
6034051 la acci n militar de rusia ha sido desproporcionada y contraria con su papel de mantenimiento de la paz as como incompatible con los principios de la resoluci n pac fica de conflictos
6034052 reveladora de los patrones diferenciales de gasto de la clase media
6034053 los consumos t picos de la clase media est n subrepresentados o a veces excluidos en el actual ipc
6034054 nosotros relevamos un conjunto de consumos caracter sticos de la clase media eso no significa que sean la mayor parte del gasto pero s definen un umbral de demanda del bienestar de ese sector
6034055 una ponderaci n significativamente mayor en el gasto y con precios que tambi n en muchos casos han crecido menos
6034056 pueden reconocer como distintivos del perfil de consumo de la clase media y tal vez ayuden a explicar su humor social

6034074 el t tulo qued en el pasado y hay que vivir del partido que viene el objetivo es mantener la actitud cuando se logra eso y sosteniendo el nivel de concentraci n el equipo termina imponi ndose
6034075 comparativamente con el inicio del campeonato pasado hoy la estructura de la idea del equipo est mucho m s plasmada dentro del juego la idea es clara y el equipo trabaja en esa b squeda
6034076 las caracter sticas de los jugadores son distintas el campeonato pasado ten a a ortega alexis a buonanotte que hoy todav a no est jugadores en el uno contra uno m s desequilibrantes
6034077 siempre en la cancha de river hay que disfrutar porque es un placer una alegr a igual nuestra idea siempre es jugar de la misma forma hay una gran ilusi n y siempre que empieza un nuevo torneo hay nuevas expectativas

6034081 las chances est n todas de nuestro lado y yo dir a que somos favoritos pero se sabe c mo es cuando se define todo en un solo partido creo que tenemos buenas posibilidades
6034082 nosotros quer amos clasificar bien arriba para no cruzarnos en esta instancia ni con estados unidos ni con espa a y lo logramos
6034083 la verdad es que a los griegos no los vi jugar en estos juegos ol mpicos pero s que son un equipo duro que traban los partidos y es dif cil encontrar cosas claras contra ellos
6034084 son speros con buena talla y mucha experiencia pero tenemos muy buenas chances de pasar porque no en vano nosotros fuimos segundos en nuestro grupo y ellos terceros en el suyo
6034085 soy inocente y lo voy a demostrar con pruebas esta fue una causa armada por telenoche investiga la periodista miriam lewin invent pruebas ahora quiero que se haga el juicio para lograr la absoluci n y despu s la paz
6034086 soy inocente y lo voy a demostrar con pruebas creo que la justicia est encarnada en hombres y los hombres pueden fallar en esta causa no se me respet ning n tipo de derecho se realizaron declaraciones fuera de jurisdicci n voy a presentar pruebas muchas pruebas para demostrar que he sido v ctima de una gran mentira
6034087 durante casi cuatro a os en la etapa de instrucci n estuvieron planteando y replanteando el tema absurdo del juicio por jurados y llevaron el tema dos veces a la suprema corte
6034088 la causa se llev adelante con todas las garant as incluso con m s garant as de las que la ley le otorga a cualquier imputado cualquier ciudadano en la misma situaci n que grassi hubiera estado con una detenci n efectiva
6034089 si por armada se entiende que existen elementos falsos eso no es cierto
6034090 grassi siempre se ha encargado de dilatar las cosas con ste ya present ocho pedidos de nulidades todos los cuales fueron rechazados incluso por la suprema corte provincial ahora tenemos un juicio sin p blico ni prensa y en ese caso el nico favorecido es grassi quien quer a evitar que lo vieran sentado en el banquillo de los acusados
6034091 act a como si fuera un testigo el acusa p blicamente a otras personas y dice que la prensa le arm la causa pero nosotros queremos discutir sobre los hechos ocurridos y sobre los cuales grassi no se hace cargo aunque hay una sinf n de pruebas en su contra
6034092 que el juicio fuera televisado que hubiera registro f lmico pero eso fue rechazado por el tribunal
6034093 no a la presencia de la prensa en el debate sino a un pedido que hizo la defensa y que fue desestimado por el tribunal para que ellos tuvieran dos c maras propias filmando todo lo que ocurre en el recinto lo quer an utilizar como si fuera el telebean el quer a filmar cada minuto para despu s hacer denuncias en contra de las v ctimas y testigos lo que nosotros pusimos en discusi n es otra cosa que la prensa pueda estar presente en el debate
6034094 no cometan el error de encerrar a un inocente justicia para grassi
6034095 no hay ninguna prueba contra el padre la pericia de la que se habla se refiere a la realizada en el calafate no arroja ning n resultado que perjudique a grassi
6034096 considero que los cambios reflejan la opini n mayoritaria del bloque y contamos para ello con la aprobaci n de la presidenta
6034097 la verdad es que con estas modificaciones la oposici n se queda con menos argumentos
6034098 me hab a planteado sus desacuerdos y me anunci que no vendr a pero creo que con estas modificaciones felipe se podr a sumar a la propuesta
6034099 aqu toda la familia vot por s a evo y no a costas ya no s qu quiere esta gente que sigue fregando en esta cuadra toditos est n con costas pero en el barrio mi mam y todos votaron por evo y evo gan no ve
6034100 la desestabilizaci n del gobierno y el derrocamiento del presidente evo morales lo intentaron el 10 de agosto y no lo lograron por eso est n armando una estrategia para dividir al pa s
6034101 el paro no ha sido acatado porque no tenemos nada que ver con esos c vicos logreros los hemos sacado a esos unionistas para que sepan que en el plan no tienen pisada
6034102 estuve con el ex presidente eduardo duhalde esta semana me voy a reunir con el radicalismo despu s con el socialismo y con la coalici n c vica
6034103 el nivel de presi n y discusi n que da el campo est m s apuntando hacia lo pol tico que hacia los problemas de naturaleza t cnica
6034104 aparentemente quiere llevarnos a que hagamos protestas fuertes sin duda as le vamos a tapar otras noticias como el tema de aerol neas argentinas o la inflaci n
6034105 la idea es salir a recorrer a todos los referentes de los partidos pol ticos
6034106 mientras sigan siendo los responsables del fracaso los que sigan manejando las pol ticas no va a haber salida y el campo va a seguir reclamando soluciones
6034107 la pol tica de precios adosada a la pol tica productiva nos va a traer problemas de producci n cada vez vamos a tener menos leche menos carne menos trigo
6034108 seguir gestionando seguir trabajando contrastar la labor efectiva con lo que dicen los dirigentes
6034109 nunca pude haber dicho eso porque a m me torturaron y me hicieron desaparecer me tuvieron 72 horas parado sin siquiera poder ir al ba o

6034115 y le digo a bussi que mi hermano no era funcionario de segunda l nea deber a tener mayor consideraci n carajo
6034116 se dijo hace un tiempo que yo dudaba de la sexualidad de este ex general
6034117 est bamos en el living de mi casa el 23 de marzo hablando de lo que deb a hacer mi posici n era firme de que se fuera y que denunciara en los medios de comunicaci n lo que estaba pasando pero no quiso dejar a su familia
6034118 tambi n quiero dejar en claro que no me un a ninguna relaci n con la se ora c rdenas en ese momento
6034119 es una bajeza lo que hizo no se puede dar explicaciones de un an nimo es una verg enza agraviar a la familia la invito a que lea el c digo procesal penal

6034128 certamente la lingua batte dove il dente duole dice un antico proverbio
6034129 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6034130 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
6034131 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6034132 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6034133 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6034134 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6034135 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6034136 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6034137 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6034138 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6034139 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6034140 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade
6034141 i broke every law on the planet to get more dope

6034156 pastor berlin may not get a fair hearing on his pending case we are here to remind justices and citizens alike that we remain vigilant in pastor berlins case and that all are accountable to god for our conduct
6034157 every day that pastor berlin is detained is another day that justice is denied to him we understand in new ways what languishing in jail is one of our vibrant church workers is doing his best to minister to other prisoners in the jail but he could be more productive if he were given his due freedom his family and church members are unduly suffering his absence as well justice delayed is justice denied
6034158 and now we have to worry about the corruption scandal allegations facing the court of appeals and the potential distraction or implications this may have on pastor berlins case it is very hard to attain justice but we will do our utmost to keep the attention of the court on his case our prayer for pastor berlins freedom must be matched by our best actions to appeal for justice

6034161 when i told people i had jury duty they would roll their eyes
6034162 i wanted to plunge my hand into the air and say pick me pick me
6034163 i never had contact with government or the court system my only contact with government was paying my taxes or a motor vehicle office

6034165 it is so well organized everyone is so professional they take care of your needs
6034166 you walk into that room and you notice that its the melting pot and you have one thing in common with them all that you are an american citizen
6034167 and maybe its not politically correct to say that im proud to be an american and that experience just brought it all home for me that this system would work for me
6034168 i felt rejected we all did because ultimately you want to do the right thing
6034169 it was a pleasure to sit in that room and focus on the history at work that the constitution is there over 200 years after the forefathers laid it out
6034170 im really into world war ii battles probably because my dad served my whole family served when i got home i called my dad and said thanks thanks to you and so many others that i dont have to speak german in my classroom i saw what you fought for
6034171 is the basic level of citizen involvement it is what you can do if you cannot serve in the military this is a system that keeps going because someone is willing to step up and keep it going i would have had a negative take on the system if i had not had the experience im glad i got the envelope and im glad it was for me

6034199 een goede en gestructureerde vorm van remote support speelt steeds vaker een cruciale rol bij het meer effici nt dynamisch en flexibel inzetten van een supportdesk zon remote supportoplossing verdient zich onmiddellijk terug in een meer effici nt en rendabel verlopend supportproces binnen een supportorganisatie en dan niet alleen doordat men aanzienlijk minder tijd en geld kwijt is aan overbodige reiskosten van support engineers een sterk verhoogde klanttevredenheid is misschien wel de grootste winstpakker op termijn onze eigen klanten zijn altijd weer blij verrast met deze snelle en effici nte vorm klantondersteuning ongeacht of we het probleem nu wel of niet direct kunnen oplossen
6034200 het verbaast mij daarom dat een aantal zelfs gerenommeerde ict dienst verleners hun supportdiensten nog steeds en uitsluitend aanbieden via de telefoon muisje links muisje rechts wat ziet u nu blijkbaar heerst daar nog het misverstand dat men als supportorganisatie alleen geld kan verdienen als men de supportdiensten ineffici nt op basis van tijdsduur organiseert maar het kan ook zijn dat men huiverig is voor mogelijke juridische aansprakelijkheden die voort zouden kunnen komen als er iets fout gaat dat laatste is niet onbegrijpelijk maar is feitelijk een schijnkwestie want ook fysiek op locatie kan een support engineer fouten maken en op de verkeerde knoppen drukken afgezien van duidelijke gebruiksvoorwaarden is het van belang dat men een remote support oplossing gebruikt die niet alleen maximaal veilig en robuust is maar ook alle supporthandelingen berichten en gebeurtenissen gedurende de gehele remote support sessie in detail registreert en archiveert en achteraf voor beide partijen opvraagbaar en toetsbaar maakt bomgar beschikt intrinsiek over een uitgebreide set van faciliteiten om zaken als veiligheid verantwoording aansprakelijkheid en rapportage naar beide partijen volledig af te dekken dat is feitelijk de basis van de bomgar oplossing zonder overigens een concessie te doen aan supportfunctionaliteit en gebruiksgemak ik durf daarom de stelling aan dat een remote supportoplossing van bomgar een meer effici ntere en beter toetsbare vorm van support oplevert dan die van een support engineer die fysiek op de locatie van de klant support levert maar je moet het als ict dienstverlener natuurlijk wel aandurven om zo transparant te zijn toch verwacht ik dat dat de richting is waar we met zn alle steeds meer naar toe zullen gaan

6034210 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6034211 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6034212 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6034213 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6034214 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6034215 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6034216 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6034217 they want to know what were going to do about it
6034218 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6034219 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6034220 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6034221 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6034222 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6034223 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6034224 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled

6034231 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
6034232 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
6034233 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
6034234 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
6034235 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
6034236 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
6034237 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
6034238 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something

6034245 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6034246 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6034247 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6034248 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6034249 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people

6034274 we welcome chiranjeevi for calling up mr advani and seeking his blessings it is healthy for the democratic practice in indian politics however no discussions on a tie up took place what was reported in a section of the media is incorrect
6034275 it is too early to think of an alliance with chiranjeevi let him come out with his ideas and policies we are not in a hurry to have a tie up with anybody at this juncture despite the fact that the party wants to strengthen the nda by inviting more parties in its fold
6034276 chiranjeevi and mr devender goud have just launched their parties both of them are yet to ready their cadre base at the village level so they cannot demand for more seats
6034277 moreover chiranjeevi has not announced his stand on telangana it is not so easy to have tie up with his party unless he supports the telangana cause

6034334 hay conciencia de que muchos choferes que trabajan en el transporte p blico suelen tener actitudes negativas respaldados por unos dirigentes que han monopolizado a su manera en el transporte en la zona oponiendose a cualquier cambio que busque un pasaje m s justo primero se opusieron a la licitacion de buses del gran concepci n lo consiguieron despu s se negaron a que el gobierno mandara unos buses para que coronel tuviera su propia linea de buses y bajar las tarifas tambi n lo consiguieron y como si fuese poco a la m s m nima alza de combustibles suben las tarifas en 100 cuentan con el apoyo del alcalde de coronel para oponerse a la licitaci n y lo m s increible es que quieren subir el pasaje a 1000 y a los estudiantes a 500 considerando que coronel y lota son las comunas m s pobres de chile

6034355 all partisan campaign activities on the seventh anniversary of the terrorist attacks
6034356 the anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks should forever remain a day of unity
6034357 all of us including those seeking public office can best honor the memories of those lost by engaging in community service and other charitable acts on that day which help to recall and rekindle the remarkable spirit of unity and compassion that existed in our country in the weeks and months following the 9 11 tragedy he says
6034358 9 11 helped us realize in an instant how insignificant our differences really are in comparison to our common goodness as human beings and our shared sense of compassion for those in need
6034359 at that moment we were all human beings and it is important that we find a way each year on 9 11 to honor that spirit of togetherness and keep it alive
6034360 in nonpartisan terms about the importance of building a culture of national service in america throughout the year not just on 9 11
6034361 as a 9 11 family member the only good thing that came from that terrible day was the way our nation came together however fleeting that moment might have been
6034362 well put a boot up your ass its the american way
6034363 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6034364 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

6034376 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
6034377 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall

6034407 no estoy nervioso hoy martes tal vez ma ana hoy s un poco es un d a especial para todos los mexicanos para todo el equipo y para m porque ser la primera vez en el estadio azteca y en juego oficial es algo particular y bonito
6034408 estoy muy curioso sic un estadio con 100 mil aficionados no s c mo ser exactamente pero me imagino que ser maravilloso y si ganamos seguro que ser todav a mejor
6034409 no puedo dar pistas nunca doy la formaci n antes del partido porque es ayudar al adversario adem s todas las formaciones siempre generan pol mica y discusi n y es mejor tener esto despu s del juego y no antes prefiero leer ma ana hoy los peri dicos para ver qu alineaci n ponen
6034410 es un equipo f sicamente muy fuerte tiene varios jugadores con mucha velocidad sobre todo david suazo es un equipo que tiene mucha posesi n del bal n est muy bien organizado y seguro que va a ser complicado pero estamos en casa
6034411 nunca nunca estamos preparados para una derrota es muy peligroso pensar en una derrota hay que ganar la responsabilidad es esa tenemos que obtener los tres puntos
6034412 es un sue o para todos los rivales que enfrentan a m xico venir a ganarle en el estadio azteca es normal pero tampoco hay que hablar de una goleada nunca lo he hecho y nunca lo har porque tengo un gran respeto por el adversario

6034419 both research and the hands on experience of state highway safety agencies indicate that this law has saved countless lives underage drinking remains a serious problem that needs to be addressed but lowering the drinking age would be a gigantic step backward for highway safety
6034420 we know from previous experience that when the drinking age was lower in the 1970s that deaths among 18 to 20 year olds in traffic fatalities went up by about 800 a year
6034421 we also know that when the age was raised in the 1980s the opposite occurred deaths went down
6034422 it would be a national tragedy to turn back the clock and jeopardize the lives of more teens
6034423 would be the dumbest thing in the world that we could do
6034424 were estimating that the reduced drinking age has saves 900 lives a year and 25 000 since weve begun collecting data on fatalities
6034425 we think that the minimum drinking age law has been incredibly effective at saving lives and we think it should stay just where it is
6034426 debemos olvidar lo que ha sucedido con el equipo que desafortunadamente no ha tenido los resultados deseados y eso al final de cuentas es lo que manda

6034440 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6034442 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6034443 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6034444 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6034445 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6034446 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6034448 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6034449 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6034466 americans have a lot on their minds these days from saving time and money to escaping from the pressures of everyday life they are not only multitasking in the bath but they also want multitasking fixtures that offer beauty comfort reliability and that meet their growing concerns for water conservation
6034467 the percentage of consumers who have reduced the amount of time they spend in the shower over the past four years is minimal based on data we collected from the 2004 bathroom habits survey with conservation being even more top of mind with consumers today its surprising that they still spend approximately the same amount of time in the shower
6034468 it is the most comprehensive tally of water saving incentives available in the industry

6034473 fans and friends have been asking me to produce an album that captures what ive been told is a totally fresh magical mix of r amp b and soul
6034474 from the moment i discovered my passion for poetry words and music ive known that i would eventually need to share it with audiences around the world this album does just that featuring four singles from my heart of hearts
6034475 the release of 4 showcases songs from the heart rooted in my past friends family and loved ones
6034476 each single sings with that gospel like sincerity yet its raw contemporary groove is anything but preachy or sappy my songs have a sexy smooth even coy feel with hints of madonna like influence but id say theyre more spiritual and inspiring from the beat to the lyrics the result is hypnotic deep and electric

6034542 this is uncouth behaviour showing no respect at all for the national flag what is there to be angry with the malaysian flag
6034543 if there are malaysians who want to take up the idea that came from the pro opposition blogger they are insulting this important national symbol flag
6034544 its all in the blog only he can do a good job hes simply creating trouble by coming up with dubious stories
6034545 it is internationally accepted that raising the flag upside down is a mark of a state in distress it is never a mark of disrespect
6034546 the band is tending more towards the sound of epic sea shanties

6034555 we are an independent state with an independent and fair judiciary system
6034556 the next year after completing the election law well have free elections
6034557 sadly the hawkish posture seems compulsory for any us politician and whether its obama or mccain or bush or lieberman or rice or biden the language is the same and the madness the same
6034558 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6034559 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6034560 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned

6034565 salman refrained from smoking his cigarettes whenever he was in his sikh characters attire on the sets when his co stars and director of the film samir karnik asked him the reason he told them that sikhs generally dont smoke as they are prohibited by their religion
6034566 when unit members suggested that he was just an actor playing a sikh and so was not to be bound by the edicts of the religion salman stuck to his ground insisting that he would defer to the turban while he was wearing it so while unit members would see salman puffing away on cigarettes while arriving at or leaving the set once he wore his turban it was no smoking for him
6034567 we used to meet him there in the past but with no official duties he was completely different

6034572 but im getting closer every day when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be back in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
6034573 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken a little longer than id have liked
6034574 id planned to be back for the start of the premier league season but it wasnt to be theres no way ill be rushing back before im ready that would be no good for myself everton or australia
6034575 its been hard missing out on a lot of football but i am thankful for what ive already achieved in my career and i have a very supportive family and a great medical team behind me
6034576 i dont particularly enjoy watching football and when youre injured you dont really feel a part of things
6034577 he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army were his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family
6034578 the colour of my medal was determined by the way the other girls sailed

6034581 sarahs getting a dog and then weve got weymouth in four years time
6034582 we hope we are getting better and we try to keep calm
6034583 but its tough on the brain and tough mentally trying to keep fighting
6034584 the only game plan we have for the final race is to win it if we win the race weve got gold anything else and you have to start looking round you have to keep focussed on what you can do we want to win

6034593 currently hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
6034594 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6034595 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in north east england
6034596 we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6034597 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6034598 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6034599 i can safely say i dont know if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
6034600 its the greatest gift ive ever been given i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share
6034601 confidence intelligence and goodness theres nothing sexier than that combination
6034602 making decisions has never been my strong point when faced with a chocolate eclair or a macaroon i dither and procrastinate and end up nibbling on both
6034603 the theme is oh just buy both embedded in there is permission to be a little self indulgent its a bit of glamorous self indulgence
6034604 sen mccain you should grab this video and play it on every ad you can this is absolutely shocking reprehensible he plans to universally disarm our nation sic the question is for what and more specifically for whom
6034605 some lefties are complaining that the video is a hack job and its out of context therefore i present to you context
6034606 in v2 were allowing sprocs to return complex types which will be the easy way to return objects which dont need to be mapped etc
6034607 i dont know where he is but i bet hes having a great time
6034608 its getting late in the season and im trying to protect these guys
6034609 when you throw 84 pitches in five innings youre working a little bit
6034610 i just go out there and pitch until they tell me not to pitch anymore
6034611 they fouled off a lot of pitches early i think my first three starts have been pretty good but i still have things to work on
6034612 i liked the way he mixed his fastball and change up
6034613 and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god
6034614 we have to figure out how we can keep them involved
6034615 some people dont mind moving around youve always got to find out where they think they see themselves fitting best and sometimes it takes a little while to learn different things
6034616 were about two thirds of the way through preseason camp and sometimes you need a little burst of adrenaline
6034617 when you get to ohio stadium it gives you a natural burst sometimes its nice just to feel the energy
6034618 the first time they came in here they were nervous when it was empty
6034619 theyll be a little more nervous monday when theres a few people no matter what you do though when you come out here aug 30 youll be petrified but maybe for a shorter time
6034620 you can really tell that those two know what theyre doing with the way they carry themselves and the way they are in meetings just the whole swagger about them
6034621 they are professionals and thats how i want to be one day
6034622 devier and i now were just part of the mix
6034623 they are taking a lot of time away from the field to put in the study of video you dont really see that with a lot of freshmen and i think thats what really makes a lot of players successful
6034624 you hear it all the time the best players are going to play and if youve got a group of guys who can help us then a group of guys are going to play
6034625 with all the guys weve got coming back and with the freshmen weve got coming in theres a lot of depth at our position that hasnt been there and im sure youll see a lot of those guys making a lot of plays
6034626 youve got to be able to run routes and catch the ball and youve got to be willing to block all day if thats what it takes
6034627 it puts a little pressure on everybody to perform but youve got to learn to deal with that
6034628 everybody should have to show up in practice every day and earn their spot
6034629 theyve both played very well even during the summer doing the drills
6034630 they are very athletic and for the most part they are picking up the offense well for what little time theyve been here
6034631 thats as well as johnnys thrown the ball since early in the year
6034632 he wouldnt have given up anything but for a cubs safety squeeze i told the infield to beware of the safety squeeze youve got to look the runner back there but they the cubs scored
6034633 soto executed it perfectly and went at the right time
6034634 i knew it was going to be a close game and i just wanted to keep it there
6034635 when they his reds teammates told me i was going to be facing good hitters i said i dont care
6034636 thats as well as johnnys thrown the ball since early in the year
6034637 he wouldnt have given up anything but for a cubs safety squeeze i told the infield to beware of the safety squeeze youve got to look the runner back there but they the cubs scored
6034638 soto executed it perfectly and went at the right time

6034640 gt atching up with sweet lou piniella and his cubs
6034641 we havent won a hundred games yet and we still need quite a few to get that number
6034642 ive only been out on the lake one time all year im older and im tired
6034643 johnny cueto who pitched tuesdays game and the kid that pitched sunday edinson volquez yeah theyve got some nice arms and theyve got some athletic kids
6034644 why do we go into the emotional aspects we can get into the emotional aspects of being married about a decision of where were going to eat in baseball you let the guys play and stay out of their way
6034645 we havent won a hundred games yet and we still need quite a few to get that number
6034646 ive only been out on the lake one time all year im older and im tired
6034647 johnny cueto who pitched tuesdays game and the kid that pitched sunday edinson volquez yeah theyve got some nice arms and theyve got some athletic kids
6034648 why do we go into the emotional aspects we can get into the emotional aspects of being married about a decision of where were going to eat in baseball you let the guys play and stay out of their way
6034649 we opted to trade ken griffey jr and adam dunn at this time because we believe it provided the best outcome for the long term success of the organization
6034650 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus toward building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent
6034651 pleased that the trades allow griffey and dunn the opportunity to play for teams in tight division races
6034652 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6034653 we have aggressively tried to improve our major league roster for the purpose of restoring championship baseball to cincinnati
6034654 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6034655 who arguably are the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6034656 we opted to trade ken griffey jr and adam dunn at this time because we believe it provided the best outcome for the long term success of the organization

6034662 who arguably are the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6034663 will round out the story arc set up by the previous two games
6034664 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
6034665 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
6034666 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
6034667 we dont know whether it was a suicide attack but the bomb went off in the compound i have initial reports of 20 dead
6034668 there are 23 confirmed dead and up to 20 wounded we have found the legs of the suspected suicide bomber
6034669 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
6034670 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
6034671 you can see the great wall of china from the moon
6034672 you spend your life working as many of us have five or six days a week with the pulse of business
6034673 to just have that stop psychologically i didnt find that it was all that appealing
6034674 its a great way to use the expertise that you have
6034675 its also an incredible opportunity for businesses or organizations to get people who are very accomplished to assist them the kind of team that quite frankly they couldnt go out and hire
6034676 we wind up with some very bright early retirees who still want to make contributions
6034677 folks are looking more and more at access to retail and entertainment within walking distance of their homes
6034678 the retirement community is sort of a leader in this
6034679 when you develop a vibrant retirement community they will pay for services that they want and appreciate and that will open up opportunities for people that want to fill those needs
6034680 its sort of creat ing a greater shortage of affordable housing
6034681 a lot of people that work in james city do find the housing costs prohibitive and they will commute in
6034682 we have a community with a mix of young and old with school kids and retirees
6034683 were not some retirement community out in the middle of nowhere where you have to drive a half hour just to go to a grocery store
6034684 when the retirees move here theyre in good health then they age in place
6034685 who will take care of them as they become more frail
6034686 lots of people continue some kind of consulting but dont want to live in d c theyve had that experience
6034687 the joke is they come play golf six months and get bored
6034688 we engage them at a very high and active level
6034689 i would have a hard time coming up with things i dont like about it except maybe for the rapid growth everyone wants to be the last one in i guess
6034690 despite the fact that it ships with a dvd drive for whatever godforsaken reason the nintendo wii doesnt support dvd playback
6034691 for whatever godforsaken reason the nintendo wii doesnt support dvd playback
6034692 we selected redprairie because they provide the best scheduling solution that can operate across tescos different formats
6034693 by helping ensure that we always have people on hand to assist shopper it supports our constant effort to improve customer experience ultimately it will improve our business by increasing store productivity and supporting revenue growth
6034694 we are delighted to deepen our relationship with tesco by helping to optimise their store operations it is highly satisfying to receive further recognition of the strength of our solutions from such a well respected company and we look forward to continued success together
6034695 this is an enormously successful national class action that rectifies a fraudulent market segmentation scheme
6034696 from their own admission such marketing practices were common within the industry for 10 years we fought a david and goliath battle with the chemical industry the disbursement of the money judgment is a warning bell to the chemical industry that they cannot market and price herbicides using fraud and intimidation
6034697 this case has had a profound impact on my life as well as those of the farmers involved
6034698 it is a great satisfaction to know that the checks are finally getting into the hands of farmers
6034699 saya keberatan dan tidak mengerti maksudnya sebab saya dipersalahkan atas apa yang sudah menjadi tugas rutin saya
6034700 hak terdakwa untuk mengajukan keberatan dan kewenangan pengadilan untuk menanyakannya alasannya sudah tugas melakukan hal biasa kok bisa dipersalahkan
6034701 kami minta waktu satu minggu untuk menghadirkan saksi saksi termasuk saksi dari mabes

6034704 oh zayn made up a country to mail his letter from you know just like how he made up four different personalities the other day
6034705 doa o quem faz o doador cabe a ele decidir a forma

6034708 vamos fazer com responsabilidade mas vamos fazer para o povo
6034709 uma doa o indireta dificulta a contabiliza o mas n o irregular acho que feito para dificultar mesmo n o chega a ser uma oculta o da contabilidade mas dificulta saber exatamente quem est doando quem n o est doando
6034710 in the last six months it appears as if valuations which in the recent past have been very high are becoming more reasonable
6034711 it appears the trend relative to acquisition opportunities is going to increase with whats happened with global liquidity and public equity market valuations
6034712 after the third quarter of 2009 if we find the level ofrestructuring as satisfactory it will allow us to move to otherstrategic targets including an ipo initial public offering
6034713 i wouldnt see it before the end of the second quarter of2009

6034724 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6034725 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6034726 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6034727 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6034728 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6034729 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6034730 vengo a buscar justicia hay sectores de la justicia que no act an mal estoy tranquilo soy inocente los hechos de los cuales se me acusa no sucedieron
6034731 tiene por objeto el reconocimiento al talento y esfuerzo de los ciudadanos paranaenses que se distinguieron de forma eminente en la pr ctica deportiva de alguna disciplina ol mpica
6034732 la difusi n de la pr ctica deportiva y los est mulos para los que llevan adelante esa actividad es una obligaci n del estado en tanto se considera al deporte uno de los factores imprescindibles en la formaci n y desarrollo integral de las personas
6034733 por sus actividades relacionadas a alg n precursor qu mico
6034734 como no se obtuvieron respuestas respecto de la lancha secuestrada decidimos quedarnos dentro del consulado hasta que existan novedades y la novedad se dio cuando el gobernador sergio urribarri por gestiones del intendente juan jos bahillo se comunic con los asamble stas y nos anunci una reuni n con canciller a para este mi rcoles
6034735 luego de este anuncio a las 15 se decidi dar por terminada la protesta y esperar al mi rcoles en estado de asamblea permanente
6034736 la lancha fue secuestrada o retenida por la prefectura uruguaya y no le permiten navegar porque pesan sobre ella una multa por haber participado de movilizaciones a ontur y al puerto de botnia
6034737 en un r o que es de libre navegabilidad y de forma inconsulta y unilateral ponen una multa que no es transmitida a la prefectura argentina como hubiera correspondido
6034738 en este momento la lancha est en fray bentos custodiada por un club n utico de all
6034739 hay una desidia total y una falta de respuestas sobre el tema
6034740 por eso la asamblea decidi manifestarse para exigir respuestas y no se produjo una toma del consulado como se difundi
6034741 porque lamentablemente al gobierno se le dieron oportunidades y un impasse en las medidas de fuerza pero despu s de los encuentros que se mantuvieron no hubo respuestas y la propuesta que se realiz desde la patronal se consider insuficiente
6034742 eso no lo vamos a permitir seguiremos luchando por una recomposici n digna seria y que beneficie al bolsillo del trabajador
6034743 har todas las actividades en la carpa y habr algunas acciones culturales
6034744 nosotros preferimos trabajar en nuestras unidades de trabajo antes que estar realizando estas medidas pero el gobierno nos trajo a esta situaci n
6034745 nos moviliz el tema que trata la obra muy actual y controvertido y a la vez resuelto con altura
6034746 el tema es de mucha actualidad con un planteo que incluye lo complejo de la sexualidad y que expone lo que es el ser humano con luces y sombras al presentar las m ltiples facetas que puede adquirir una persona frente a otras
6034747 durante estos a os hemos transitado un camino de crecimiento que nos ha llevado a consolidarnos en el grupo que ya no es s lo de teatro hemos pasado de ser actrices a amigas
6034748 la obra ha dado un giro los personajes se presentan esta vez tamizados a trav s de la experiencia que cada una de nosotras ha tenido en estos a os
6034749 han tenido la generosidad de ofrecer este espacio para poder presentar la obra
6034750 muy bien ubicada y con todas las comodidades necesarias para poder sentirse a gusto y que tanto p blico como artistas pasen un buen momento
6034751 esto demuestra la dilaci n de la reparaci n hist rica que tiene que haber en salud
6034752 la reuni n que ten amos pautada para hoy por ayer martes se pas para ma ana hoy mi rcoles lo que demuestra la dilaci n de la reparaci n hist rica que tiene que haber en salud
6034753 pretendemos mayor presupuesto para mejorar la atenci n del derecho a la salud que qued consagrado en la constituci n
6034754 se deber duplicar o triplicar porque con lo destinado actualmente no se logra ning n efecto en la poblaci n sino que al contrario hay defectos en la atenci n p blica
6034755 ya sea como materia prima productos semielaborados o productos terminados
6034756 que habr n de requerirse para la producci n l cita de medicamentos para uso humano y a los efectos de limitar la posibilidad de desv o o uso il cito

6034760 nosotros esperaremos el mandato de las bases para definir qu es lo que hacemos de aqu hacia adelante
6034761 vamos mal si seguimos con estas leyes de excarcelaci n estas personas no pueden volver a salir

6034766 ik ben geen onnozelaar en ik weet dat het beleid altijd beter kan maar ik krijg het op mijn heupen van mensen die aan de zijkant staan te roepen en nooit een positief voorstel doen we zullen wel afrekenen op het einde van de spelen
6034767 ik denk dat een ander er meer plezier aan beleeft ik kijk de sluiting altijd liever met mijn coach samen met een biertje voor de televisie maar als ik toch word gevraagd zal ik het met alle plezier doen

6034774 i saw a man who said he was going to see jay back up in the mountains
6034775 i have no name or rather i have many names but most of them are unpronounceable and they wouldnt mean anything to you anyway

6034794 im rahmen des mandats planen wir die einrichtung von zwei linien
6034795 auf der zweiten linie die in der zweiten etappe entstehen soll und die entlang der administrativen grenze s dossetiens verlaufen wird werden beobachterposten des russischen friedenskontingents eingerichtet
6034796 au erdem sollen dort bedingungen f r den st ndigen aufenthalt der friedenssoldaten geschaffen werden
6034797 wir sind von der schwarzmeerflotte schriftlich ber die r ckkehr der schiffe zu ihrem st ndigen stationierungsort informiert worden
6034798 die uno ist eine ma gebende organisation die tatsache dass sie bereits beginnt hilfe zu leisten ist gut wir sind bereit ihnen jede unterst tzung zu erweisen um diese hilfe zweckm ig zu verwenden
6034799 falls sie sich eine frontale kollision w nschen sie werden sie bekommen selbstredend wird es auf unserem territorium russische st tzpunkte und alles andere geben denn weder russland noch abchasien haben keinen anderen weg die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens muss anerkannt werden ein milit rvertrag muss unterschrieben werden die st tzpunkte der russischen armee m ssen ebenfalls errichtet werden doch das wichtigste haben wir bereits vom russischen pr sidenten erfahren russland bleibt im kaukasus die meinung des westens ist uns ehrlich gesagt wurscht
6034800 russland muss um den eigenen erfolg zu sichern und die eroberten positionen nicht zu verlieren die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dossetiens anerkennen
6034801 sonst k nnte es zu sp t sein die aufnahme georgiens in die nato k nnte gestartet werden falls tiflis eine erneute gegen uns gerichtete aggression anfangen wird wird russland nicht in der lage sein sich einzumischen und uns zu besch tzen denn dann w re es gezwungen mit den nato truppen zu k mpfen

6034803 misbehaving on board is a threat not just to the people involved but to the safety of the whole plane
6034804 it is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers
6034805 such striking differences in behaviour between liars and truth tellers are rarely seen in deception research
6034806 liars must need to make up their stories and must monitor their fabrication so that they are plausible and adhere to everything the observer knows or might find out
6034807 in addition liars must remember their earlier statements so that they appear consistent when re telling their story and know what they told to whom
6034808 ive bought three geese from an leveur near here theyre 14 each and it seemed crazy to go all the way back home to fetch the extra cash

6034810 very few older people are hunched over with a walking stick they are assuming everyone who is old looks like that and they dont
6034811 the motivation behind these signs to make drivers more careful of their speed in areas with residential care homes is positive
6034812 however in practice a reduced speed limit in such areas as implemented in school districts would be a more welcome way to achieve this
6034813 they should pay more attention to the real concerns of older people rising taxes and soaring household bills
6034814 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves

6034826 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6034827 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6034828 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6034829 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6034830 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26

6034837 in the absence of fresh interventions from the authorities mortgage lending activity is set to worsen in the second half of 2008
6034838 dampening of consumer demand due to tightened lending criteria declining house prices and pressures on household finances from higher food and energy costs
6034839 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6034840 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008

6034960 the only silver lining to that cloud of mosquitoes in your garden is that they are a reliable source of food for thousands of animals including birds bats dragonflies and frogs

6034970 drohen die medien zum surrealen kettenbrief digitaler illusionen und t uschungen zu werden wo die fakten durch meinungen und die professionellen nachrichtensammeler von durchgeknallten kommentatoren ersetzt werden
6034971 er det mig der er fuld eller er han ret l kker
6034972 det er helt udelukket at de kan tale engelsk p deres m der det er i strid med hele det nordiske samarbejdes ide
6034973 using english at their meetings is completely out of the question it is incompatible with the very concept of nordic co operation
6034974 and since understanding neighbouring languages is not a priority in the nordic education systems youngsters find it increasingly necessary to communicate in english so they are able to understand each other at all
6034975 language is an important part of the common nordic culture and a key to understanding rather than a barrier
6034976 we want to pay tribute to the nominees and the nordic films
6034977 quite possibly one or more of the films will not have been shown at cinemas in the five nordic countries now the movie audiences will get a chance to see all nominated films and so make up their own opinions before the winner is announced 15 october
6034978 o que falta para os brasileiros mais treino e competi es contra os estrangeiros
6034979 precisamos estar competindo sempre contra eles e isso o que vamos procurar competir mais nos estados unidos na europa n o sei como vai ser mas temos que mudar

6034983 will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it
6034984 it is likely to take more time as differences remain between the u s and north korea
6034985 the baton charges and firing smoke shells wont stop us getting back the land
6034986 if those figures were accurate there needs to be mass graves where are those graves
6034987 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad
6034988 we are an independent state with an independent and fair judiciary system
6034989 the next year after completing the election law well have free elections
6034990 some forces who are targeting sudans resources are encouraging fighting in sudan and want her to be divided
6034991 just touch it come on do it for the feeling
6034992 youre smashing a mom while her son is in the front seat
6034993 no dont stress dude we slipped him a roofie earlier he cant hear or see
6034994 you are saying my main chap is too cold look at you youre like the friggin ice queen of cape town maybe if you smiled for once and didnt always insist on eating at the finest restaurants and only drinking champagne or red bull you would be a little warmer

6034996 saya bingung mengapa mengangkat endro utomo sebagai ketua panitia lelang disebut perbuatan melawan hukum lalu kemudian dinyatakan sebagai tindak pidana korupsi lalu saya ditahan lalu saya didakwa
6034997 dan berkali kali saya nyatakan di depan penyidik sk itu cacat hukum karena aneh dan saya tidak pernah menerima aslinya
6034998 saya juga tidak mengerti dan karenanya menolak dakwaan tentang penggelembungan harga barang di tvri tahun 2002 saya sama sekali tidak pernah terlibat dan tidak pernah mengurusi masalah harga
6034999 dan dalam keadaan jiwanya yang tertekan karena tak percaya atas dakwaan yang didakwakan

6035024 we hope that not only will japan continue the refueling operation in the indian ocean but that they will consider other things that they could contribute to the situation in afghanistan
6035025 i think that japans contributions there could be substantial toward helping afghanistan become a functioning democracy what is happening in afghanistan is very important to the whole international community

6035028 an involving point of entry distinguishes some of the most successful radio ads in our study
6035029 words that are sensory laden emotional or empowering have a demonstrable impact on the emotional reactions of consumers
6035030 audio can generate stronger emotions than visuals especially when the tonality in the ad is used effectively
6035031 the best radio ads mention the advertisers brand multiple times strategically placed to correlate with moments of high consumer engagement

6035041 a proposal to amend the state constitution to alter the legislative executive and judicial branches of state government the proposed constitutional amendment would require no reason absentee voting limit election officials support of candidates create separate office of elections to supervise elections create direct initiation of laws by petition reduce number of senate and house districts establish bipartisan commission and standards for creating legislative districts prohibit state court review of districts prohibit former elected officials from lobbying for 2 years reduce salaries limit retirement benefits and disclose personal finances of legislative executive and judicial officials disclose legislatures financial records limit state departments to 18 cap boards commissions reduce size of supreme court and appeals court add circuit judges transfer discipline of judges to new commission should this proposal be adopted
6035042 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
6035043 whatever mistakes tblisi has made they cannot justify russias actions
6035044 moscow has invaded a neighbor an illegal act of aggression that violates the u n charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in europe
6035045 beginning a well planned war as the olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the games

6035050 were willing to sit down with these guys and make a deal
6035051 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
6035052 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
6035053 i know hes not talking about us but how do we handle situations like that
6035054 pretty well everyone is sold out of stock there we have seen premiums as high as 2 50 an ounce which is unheard of in india most refiners are now booked solid through september
6035055 premiums for gold bars shot to their their highest level this year as consumers returned to the physical market in droves encouraged by a sharp drop in bullion prices ahead of key religious festivals in asia
6035056 det springende punkt er om dommeren vil have at vi konkret skal bevise at der er tale om bedrageri i hvert enkelt tilf lde eller om dommeren k ber vores p stand om at selve spillet er bedrageri
6035057 med en frihedsstraf har man i hvert fald tidligere kunnet udstede et indrejseforbud nu er det lidt mere uklart hvad der skal til for at give eu borgere et indrejseforbud men det er tanken
6035058 vi har f et at vide at vi ikke kan bruge hasardparagraffen og hvis bedrageriparagraffen viser sig heller ikke at kunne bruges s f r vi brug for en lov der forbyder det her

6035063 ive been working on it for so long now its not like a usual year
6035064 the journeys really cool we learn something about wilson we learn something about house and we learn something about their relationship
6035065 the notion was that they would be coming back in different capacities in the hospital and therefore come back with a greater gravitas and have a different relationship with house and that would be refreshing as little as we used them again we would have liked to use them more i really did like the use we made of them they would come in for only a scene or two an episode but those scenes had a greater weight
6035066 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving
6035067 tatsache ist aber dass apl ohne die bernahme heute nicht mehr existieren w rde
6035068 jeremiah 15 1 2 when they rejected god and his word as their way of life they forfeited the privilege of his protection and suffered tragic spiritual and physical loss
6035069 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee to hear my words then i went down to the potters house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it then the word of the lord came to me saying o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potters hand so are ye in mine hand o house of israel
6035070 thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts
6035071 von diesem gesetz au enwirtschaftsgesetz her und in meinen augen kann hapag lloyd kaufen wer immer es kaufen will
6035072 es ist nichts was in dem fall den gesetzgeber oder die bundesregierung etwas angeht
6035073 es reichte am dienstag gerade einmal zu einer kleinen korrektur des euro ausgel st von ein paar ungeduldig gewordenen euro shorties die wom glich aus angst vor einer gr eren lpreis rallye ihre engagements vorsichtshalber glattstellten
6035074 die vom kabinett beschlossene versch rfung des au enwirtschaftsgesetzes ist berfl ssig diskriminierend und ein fatales signal f r potentielle investoren und gesch ftspartner das dem wirtschaftsstandort schadet deutschlands offene grenzen und seine liberale wirtschaftsordnung sind die basis f r unsere erfolge auf den weltweiten m rkten die wir nicht gef hrden d rfen
6035075 alle fragen der industrie und wettbewerbspolitik sind schon heute gegenstand nationaler und europ ischer gesetze zur fusionskontrolle vertraglicher verpflichtungen zur grundversorgung mit ffentlichen g tern sowie der exportkontrolle anstatt ausl ndische investitionen zu begrenzen w re es sinnvoll eine sehr viel gr ere transparenz einzufordern der derzeitige gesetzesentwurf erschwert jedoch die rahmenbedingungen f r ausl ndische investitionen in deutschland da er rechtsunsicherheit schafft
6035076 ich gehe davon aus dass wir aus br ssel keinerlei bedenken erhalten werden
6035077 ich freue mich dass wir einige stars der deutschen kochszene daf r gewinnen konnten beim caravan salon in einer reisemobilk che zu kochen
6035078 k che wie alfons schuhbeck lea linster oder rainer sass werden im caravaning kochstudio gerichte aus den beliebtesten urlaubsl ndern kochen und den messebesuchern tipps f r das kochen unterwegs geben
6035079 die produktionszahlen der caravans und reisemobile spiegeln den trend zum reisemobil in deutschland und europa wider angesichts der dramatischen europaweiten entwicklung der energiekosten und der angeschlagenen konjunktur in deutschland ist diese stabile gesamtentwicklung der produktionszahlen erfreulich
6035080 nick letztes jahr hast du anl sslich des americas cup in valencia an einem ungew hnlichen dreikampf teilgenommen segeln golfen und motorsport waren die disziplinen in denen du angetreten bist was hat dir am besten gefallen
6035081 das segeln super wetter ein leichter wind und da war irgendwie so ein bisschen relaxte urlaubsstimmung auch wenn man ein rennen inszeniert hat dabei ging es dann nat rlich nicht um alles aber das war eigentlich f r mich das sch nste
6035082 im moment wenn ich mir eins kaufen w rde w re es eher ein motorboot
6035083 es kommt nicht h ufig vor aber vielleicht ein bis zwei mal ber das jahr gesehen gibt es irgendwo ein event an der rennstrecke oder bei einer charity veranstaltung wo man dann auch hoffentlich zeit hat ich wei gar nicht was ich f r ein eingetragenes handicap habe wenn ich zwei dreimal spiele komme ich vielleicht so auf 20
6035084 der gr te unterschied ist dass valencia ein stadtkurs sein wird den keiner bis jetzt kennt dementsprechend ist es auch ein rennen auf das ich mich sehr freue weil es neu ist und man einfach nicht wei was einen erwartet das werde ich zu fu abschreiten wenn es geht auch mit dem motorroller oder pkw abfahren und vorher im kopf dann nat rlich einige male durchgehen
6035085 we treated russia for a long time as a defeated nation and many of russias natural interests and concerns were not taken into account
6035086 in the last seven or eight years russia was getting stronger and began to defend its national interests more vigorously
6035087 this is another paradigm in our relations with russia that hasnt yet been accepted that russia is a significant player in the international arena
6035088 i was very depressed in abkhazia because it was inconceivable for me to imagine that georgians and abkhazians would be killing each other
6035089 my family had spent almost every summer in abkhazia a beautiful place like california or florida in this country but on the black sea meeting internally displaced people who had fled from abkhazia they had lost everything their homes identities and hope in the future my heart was bleeding
6035090 the russians were carefully watching this volatile region and ready to intervene in case of exactly this type of development
6035091 put yourself in russian president dmitry medvedevs shoes what would a regional superpower do
6035092 but this crisis gives a good chance for russia the u s and europe to restore a constructive relationship and expand their cooperation rather than accuse each other of wrongdoings that will depend on the wisdom of their leaders
6035093 unusually dry and if it continues at this rate it is going to be the driest august on record for charlottesville
6035094 the dell pond is down to the level we stopped using it last year
6035095 below normal levels which are normally at the lowest levels of the year to begin with
6035096 there is more being withdrawn than is flowing into it
6035097 i dont mind oil changes and we do a lot of them
6035098 but what i really like is a challenge trying to figure out whats gone wrong with an engine or an electrical system and coming up with the best way to fix it
6035099 it helps to have people who dont wait on jobs but try out things on their own and patience too is necessary
6035100 it felt like a knife was jabbing me in the middle of my chest
6035101 heres what were proposing how do you think thats going to go
6035102 church forms a cirice cyrice chiriche churiche chereche b circe cyrce chyrce cirke etc etc
6035103 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
6035104 he said it is a story that the police invented to camouflage the real story
6035105 he doesnt know why he was shot he was shot in the back
6035106 aby sme mohli uspokoji viacer ch zberate ov a z ujemcov o fajky rozhodli sme sa pon knu vy e 80 fruniho fajok zostaven ch do 16 s prav z ujemcovia si ich m u obhliadnu do 25 augusta denne od 10 00 do 12 00 v budove ko ick ho obvodn ho radu na komensk ho ulici 52
6035107 these keynotes are an exceptional opportunity for search marketers to understand where our industry is headed tim is a google veteran who helped build google into the advertising powerhouse it is today plus hes fought the battles to help search advertising gain acceptance bill as a self avowed data geek is always entertaining when he shares what we can learn about ourselves from how we search were fortunate and pleased to have both participating
6035108 even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
6035109 theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6035110 my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
6035111 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals
6035112 i couldnt believe it when i saw how much i needed to pay i then realised that it was archie
6035113 he was very understanding although before he put the phone down he did ask if i still wanted it
6035114 he said he only wanted the games but the problem is he doesnt understand money
6035115 all the very best and say thanks for their work at radio 1
6035116 at the recent linux world event we have known about the company behind ubuntu it indirectly referred to a big announcement that tied ubuntu to the coming netbook and we have been waiting for that news for quite long time
6035117 the interesting part of the story is that the version of ubuntu with the dell machines will be the new netbook remix edition
6035118 this new version of ubuntu is the best for the atom processor and it has a new big button interface very similar to those found in the aspire one and eeepc
6035119 the coming dell machine would provide us an opportunity to note what canonical has been doing during all summer and it would certainly cast a considerable impact on the netbook market
6035120 este sistema funciona 100 garantizado es el mejor sistema del flujo de dinero con los mejores beneficios con solamente una inversi n inicial m nima

6035122 here at samsung we were wondering how to celebrate the launch of the samsung omnia i900 so we had a chat with some impishly creative friends of ours and this is what happened
6035123 thats exactly the kind of thread a government agent would start
6035124 there were jews dancing in the streets on 9 11
6035125 their fingers bleed but they press on for if they dont make the days quota 5 000 bulbs they are beaten inmates like these often make the christmas lights that decorate the trees of christian believers around the world their crime preaching the gospel of jesus christ house church pastors are sent to work camps after their arrest and in some respects these are the lucky ones for they survived the standard interrogations that greet most christian leaders after they are detained several are killed or disappear never to be seen or heard from again
6035126 he said to those people who were then captive nations the day will come when you will know freedom and democracy and the fundamental rights of man our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world and id like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today and the darkest corners little countries like belarus they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us
6035127 die ffentliche ordnung oder sicherheit der bundesrepublik deutschland beeintr chtigt
6035128 mit dem kabinettsbeschluss soll lediglich die rechtsgrundlage f r ein instrument geschaffen werden wie es auch andere bedeutende industrienationen haben
6035129 wir wollen dass ausl ndische investitionen in deutschen unternehmen in sehr seltenen ausnahmenf llen gepr ft werden k nnen
6035130 ich gehe davon aus dass wir aus br ssel keinerlei bedenken zu erwarten haben
6035131 die kosten und die abgaben m ssen in dieser republik runter und nicht erh ht werden
6035132 wir wollen dieses geld zu 100 prozent in die infrastruktur stecken
6035133 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6035134 die niederl nder waren und sind auf diesem gebiet f hrend
6035135 erstens eine starke tradition der typografie und der verlage die weltber hmt ist und bis ins 17 jahrhundert zur ckf hrt
6035136 dadurch sind sie manchmal zu k nstlerisch aber das ist auch ihre kraft
6035137 die studenten dort lernen ihr handwerk und bleiben konventioneller w hrend ihre niederl ndischen kommilitonen sich an den akademien im ausbrechen aus konventionen ben k nnen darin sind sie sehr gut und beweisen auch oft viel humor
6035138 wenn ich mal zwei drei spiele hintereinander spiele und dann m glichst gut wird das meine chancen sicherlich verbessern
6035139 ich habe das zwar anders gesehen aber damit kann ich leben wenn man mir eine teilschuld an der niederlage gibt
6035140 daf r ist es jetzt noch zu fr h wir haben viele gute torh ter zur auswahl
6035141 es ist jetzt unsere aufgabe bis zur wm 2010 die drei besten torh ter zu finden die t r ist f r jeden offen in alle richtungen
6035142 die aktuellen leistungen in der bundesliga und im europacup werden genau registriert
6035143 wenn wir eine nummer eins gefunden haben dann werden wir dieser auch bedingungslos den r cken st rken
6035144 in deutschland haben wir den gro teil der abschreibungen auf subprime papiere hinter uns
6035145 rein mathematisch betrachtet kann da eigentlich nicht mehr viel kommen
6035146 esto no deber a suponer en ning n caso el abandono de los derechos ling sticos de los espectadores de cine en nuestro pa s
6035147 las productoras muestran un compromiso con el proceso de normalizaci n ling stica
6035148 el reto del gallego no est en las salas de cine sino en las televisiones y en los tel fonos m viles las dos plataformas que en el presente y cada vez m s de cara el futuro distribuyen m s contenidos audiovisuales a un n mero mayor de personas
6035149 ich habe ihn zu meinem kapit n bei feyenoord gemacht und konnte mir zu der entscheidung nur gratulieren er war perfekt in der rolle und das wird er auch in der nationalmannschaft sein
6035150 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice
6035151 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6035152 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6035153 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6035154 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6035155 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6035156 wir wollen uns unseren fans in regelm igen abst nden zeigen ich kann mir vorstellen dass der dfb zweimal im jahr einen tag der offenen t r veranstaltet um seine arbeit und die nationalmannschaft vor einem l nderspiel zu pr sentieren
6035157 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6035158 you guys obviously dont know kenny from the 70s 80s or 90s ill give him the fact that hes a great bowler but thats it maybe hes changed in this decade but i cant forget knowing him for all those years
6035159 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6035160 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6035161 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6035162 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6035163 they told me there are going to be resources here
6035164 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6035165 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6035166 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6035167 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6035168 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6035169 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6035170 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6035171 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6035172 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6035173 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6035174 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6035175 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6035176 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6035177 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6035178 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6035179 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6035180 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
6035181 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
6035182 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
6035183 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
6035184 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
6035185 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
6035186 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
6035187 theres a sucker born every minute and they are all hillary supporters
6035188 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6035189 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6035190 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6035191 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6035192 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6035193 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6035194 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
6035195 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
6035196 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
6035197 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
6035198 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
6035199 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6035200 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6035201 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6035202 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6035203 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6035204 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6035205 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6035206 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6035207 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6035208 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6035209 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6035210 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6035211 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6035212 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6035213 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6035214 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6035215 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6035216 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6035217 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6035218 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6035219 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6035220 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
6035221 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
6035222 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6035223 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6035224 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
6035225 retailers are mature enough in this industry that they understand that consumers will visit their web sites before they ever visit the store
6035226 ninety percent of consumers go online to research before they buy that makes it even more important to have your brand replicated online because millions of people a day can come and check out your web site
6035227 were probably better friends today after two ventures than we were as kids thats pretty rare
6035228 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6035229 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6035230 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6035231 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6035232 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6035233 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6035234 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6035235 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6035236 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6035237 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6035238 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6035239 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6035240 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6035241 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6035242 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6035243 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6035244 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6035245 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6035246 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6035247 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6035248 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6035249 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6035250 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6035251 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6035252 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6035253 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6035254 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6035255 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
6035256 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
6035257 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
6035258 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
6035259 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
6035260 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
6035261 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
6035262 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6035263 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6035264 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6035265 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6035266 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6035267 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6035268 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6035269 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6035270 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6035271 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6035272 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6035273 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6035274 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6035275 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6035276 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6035277 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6035278 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6035279 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6035280 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6035281 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6035282 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6035283 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6035284 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6035285 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6035286 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6035287 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6035288 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6035289 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6035290 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6035291 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6035292 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6035293 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6035294 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6035295 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6035296 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6035297 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6035298 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6035299 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6035300 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6035301 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6035302 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6035303 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6035304 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6035305 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6035306 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6035307 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6035308 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6035309 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6035310 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6035311 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6035312 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
6035313 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
6035314 what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
6035315 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
6035316 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
6035317 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
6035318 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
6035319 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
6035320 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
6035321 get it off the air and i really mean it
6035322 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
6035323 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
6035324 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
6035325 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
6035326 i am married to the next president of the united states
6035327 run for governor ok what do i have to do
6035328 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
6035329 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
6035330 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
6035331 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
6035332 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
6035333 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
6035334 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
6035335 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
6035336 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6035337 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6035338 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6035339 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6035340 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6035341 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6035342 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6035343 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6035344 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6035345 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6035346 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6035347 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6035348 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6035349 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6035350 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6035351 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6035352 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6035353 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6035354 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6035355 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6035356 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6035357 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6035358 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6035359 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
6035360 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
6035361 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
6035362 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
6035363 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
6035364 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
6035365 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
6035366 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
6035367 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
6035368 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
6035369 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
6035370 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
6035371 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
6035372 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6035373 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6035374 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6035375 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6035376 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6035377 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6035378 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6035379 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6035380 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6035381 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6035382 notebook dan pc akan seimbang pada tahun 2011 nanti bahkan pasar komputer akan berubah haluan untuk lebih memfokuskan diri pada penjualan ke retail
6035383 ada empat kategori kalangan pengguna notebook kalangan pemerintahan menduduki posisi pertama disusul pebisnis atau komersial retail atau konsumer dan terakhir institusi pendidikan
6035384 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6035385 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6035386 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6035387 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6035388 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6035389 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6035390 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6035391 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6035392 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6035393 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6035394 italia no puede permitir la pr ctica de la tortura
6035395 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
6035396 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6035397 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6035398 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6035399 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6035400 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6035401 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate

6035406 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

6035410 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6035411 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6035412 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6035413 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6035414 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6035415 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6035416 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one

6035426 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6035427 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6035428 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6035429 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
6035430 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
6035431 these are all small things and they all add up

6035459 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
6035460 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
6035461 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
6035462 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
6035463 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members

6035502 jag var revisor i b rjan av 1980 talet sedan dess har jag varit l rare i redovisning redovisning har varit en del jag arbetat mycket med men som inte syns p samma s tt
6035503 jag var inne p finansmarknaden under andra halvan av 1980 talet i b rjan av 1990 talet blev jag b rskr nik r p svenska dagbladet och var ven p aktuellt redaktionen under andra halvan av 1990 talet var jag p firman som nu heter kaupthing d hette det aragon kapitalf rvaltning sedan gick jag till nordnet

6035514 at that moment it was clear that man was not going to stop these fires
6035515 the reason they were there was really a policy issue and that policy still stands
6035516 there are still firefighters being put in there at unnecessary extra risk
6035517 theres not an incident commander out there thats going to put firefighter lives at risk for politics
6035518 if you dont do anything those fires tend to get larger and they can move outside the wilderness boundaries impacting the areas outside the wilderness
6035519 in the long run its going to be weather thats going to put these fires out
6035520 were going to look for opportunities to reduce the intensities of these fires and be as safe as possible
6035521 boise national forest has said they will fight it with all that they got and i believe them

6035534 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6035535 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6035536 the first indication that this signing was going to happen took place a few days ago mid conflict between russia and georgia i might add where poland indicated it was willing to allow the us to station its missile defence shield on its territory
6035537 thats the main concern here and what we have been seeing over the past few days is russia acting accordingly to beef up its own defences as well
6035538 we have heard some incendiary comments from the ministry of defence here that poland would now be perhaps a new target for russian missiles
6035539 the tragedy in all of this confrontation with russia is that the system thats proposed for poland and the czech republic is a scarecrow
6035540 its not something that europe can rely on it is not dependable if iran had missiles that could reach central europe which they dont yet this system couldnt be relied on to defend against them anyway
6035541 some of this may be just a threat but russia has shown in just the past week or so it has a formidable military force so if i were poland or the czech republic i would be more worried about russia than i would be about iran or north korea
6035542 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6035543 users need to be careful about overheating of the machines
6035544 our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again
6035545 real knowledge is to know the extent of ones ignorance
6035546 a partir de ahora estados unidos y polonia estar n seguros
6035547 de esta forma completamos las negociaciones que fueron duras pero siempre amistosas porque estadounidenses y polacos somos amigos
6035548 the ceasefire committees are doing their best to protect the gains of the peace process
6035549 we are trying our best to meet amid the present situation in mindanao both parties have expressed optimism that we could be meeting anytime between tomorrow and august 31 minus the meeting then we will not have a new terms of reference for the imt so it would be of much regret that we would lose temporarily the services of the very important imt
6035550 the ceasefire committees of both panels are present on the ground they are existing and they are not obliterated just because of the expiration of the imt and by experience the local monitoring team composed of civil society and local volunteers have proven that they could be a good help in securing peace in the areas where there is ceasefire

6035572 yes i am a massachusetts republican which is about the same as being an alabama democrat
6035573 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
6035574 it should be known that jonathan crutchleys donation to mccain left the entire board in disbelief i am disappointed that we have lost some customers and i understand the anger it is too bad for the web site if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense earlier today at the request of the board jonathan has stepped down as chairman
6035575 mccain now has a 9 point edge 49 percent to 40 percent over obama on the critical question of who would be the best manager of the economy an issue nearly half of voters said was their top concern in the november 4 presidential election
6035576 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6035577 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his

6035580 jesse is a bigger than life personality and there is always an advantage of having a brand name like his attached to a show
6035581 that personality could especially work well in the court genre where he could break through in a crowded field needless to say it would be hard to confuse him with the other judges
6035582 like billy graham warren knows that liberals mistake his kind spiritedness for moderation
6035583 in fact warren stands side by side with the hardest right wing of fundamentalism theological point by point but hes a much better salesman
6035584 initially i was concerned it would be a feel good affair without tough questions asked by warren the promo mentioned leadership environment poverty and so on as topics to be discussed it turned out to be a very good forum with warren asking a lot of insightful questions
6035585 im going to ask them about abortion i am going to ask them about the definition of marriage but im also going to ask them about more than that

6035591 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6035592 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6035593 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea

6035595 all the indicators that make it our way make it seem like theyre in crisis mode
6035596 the fact that we are looking to out of the state agencies with these few days to go tells me that the ball was dropped
6035597 youre not going to see anybody in a uniform at the xcel energy center
6035598 just as we routinely do in state emergencies the national guard is available in the event that additional manpower equipment or capability is needed
6035599 due to the national special security event status there are more than 1 000 minnesota national guard troops dedicated to assist the minnesota national guard is a partner in a support role with local state and federal law enforcement during the republican national convention in the twin cities
6035600 weve been on this path for the last few years
6035601 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
6035602 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
6035603 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
6035604 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
6035605 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
6035606 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
6035607 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
6035608 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
6035609 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
6035610 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk

6035617 the highest calling of mankind can only be to become a musician in the profoundest sense to conceive and shape the world musically
6035618 at the middle of the century an orientation away from mankind began once again one looked up to the stars and began an intensive measuring and counting
6035619 i now wanted a structure to be realised in an etude that was already worked into the micro dimension of a single sound so that in every moment however small the overall principle of my idea would be present
6035620 he absolutely refused to follow my advice he did not want any advice at all what i remember is a charming young man who could have been involved in a mutually interesting exchange of ideas but just did not want to listen to any rational view of things and clung on to his study on one sound with a perfectly natural sense of ambition
6035621 he got down to splicing and came back very happy and we said well fine lets have a listen to it so we played back the tape and all you heard was schuuut that was stockhausens sound study a sort of schuuutt he was terribly pleased with it
6035622 it shows that i can always allow myself to escape from my own house from my own system

6035625 overall obama holds a narrow edge over the arizona senator 45 to 43 which falls within the polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points in june obama was ahead by 12 points other polls at that time showed him with a narrower lead
6035626 more striking than the head to head matchup however is the drop in obamas favorable rating in the run up to his selection of a running mate and the democratic national convention next week in denver
6035627 obamas favorable rating has sunk to 48 from 59 since the last times bloomberg poll in june

6035630 this reflects not only the growing stature of the world expo but also the close ties between singapore and china
6035631 singapores experience in building a garden city is beneficial for chinas urban construction especially for chinese cities
6035632 we are hoping to tap on them to give us ideas and hopefully a different perspective of what singapore means to them and this would go towards the content pavilion we are also asking people to suggest a theme

6035635 abri la puerta para que los otros artistas ganaran dinero de verdad
6035636 the best system for picking a chief executive suited to a nation like ours a geographically large ideologically diverse socially complex federal republic
6035637 i can only go by the polls which show mccain winning the state handily
6035638 if senator mccain is truly getting such a large percentage of the jewish vote its probably an indicator that heavily democrat areas of florida will not hold up for senator obama and will cause obama to lose the state
6035639 a person of principle who has a great record of supporting israel
6035640 understands that israel is our strong ally and is committed to protecting the jewish state
6035641 obama has vowed to meet with iranian leaders who have called israel names that i prefer not to repeat
6035642 veterans understand that mccain has been in their position before
6035643 the country first mentality is a common factor for many vets and military and they know that mccain has the experience needed
6035644 obama has stated on several occasions that he would meet with leaders such as fidel castro without preconditions many latinos are noticing what is happening with leaders such as chavez or evo morales and they oppose obamas plans and can see that he does not have the experience needed to deal with latin america
6035645 the situation in congress demonstrates the lack of interest for the environment and our energy crisis and people are becoming more aware of what is happening
6035646 the american people deserve a commander in chief who puts their country first ahead of party politics and self interest senator obama is slowly revealing himself to americans and many do not like what they see
6035647 in ohio kitchen table issues are dominant ohio has lost 250 000 manufacturing jobs to places like china and mexico due to the failed bush economic policies that john mccain promises to continue
6035648 there isnt an attack ad in the book that can save john mccain if ohio voters walk into the voting booth thinking about their jobs their mortgages their gas tanks or their grocery bills
6035649 jobs have disappeared abroad mainly because unions require 35 per hour salaries with pensions and vacations for 55 year olds who watch machines all day and take long lunches think that flies in beijing
6035650 the democrats cannot use gas prices and heating bills as reasons veterans will discount john mccain who has spent nearly his entire life in service to his country
6035651 words like duty honor and country belong in a much more powerful context to men who have fought for our freedom
6035652 it is almost entirely due to the northern virginia area the only area thats truly liberal
6035653 say they will vote for obama but these same people will condemn obama amongst their friends so the polls might not be as accurate as we think
6035654 in every single presidential election ive observed the democratic candidate has always had a significant lead over the republican candidate
6035655 in the home state of john ashcroft where a republican governor has 76
6035656 to win here you must appeal to both the metro and rural voter this is why missouri is a bell weather
6035657 farmers will be watching for the candidate who will extend his hand to help them they cannot be overlooked
6035658 iowans especially farmers can spot fakes be honest or be gone
6035659 being a middle american seeing someone who isnt even officially the candidate acting like hes already won the election is a major turn off because it comes off as arrogant and presumptuous
6035660 iowans expect our leaders to be humble and accountable not a rock star
6035661 the iowa economy is better than much of the country
6035662 it is slowing just not as much i think it may be somewhat of an advantage but it is still to early to tell senator mccain is working hard in iowa and i think he will do well in our state
6035663 independent voters are beginning to hop off the obama bandwagon as they learn more about his liberal voting record and recognize his lack of experience
6035664 groups that i do see as potential pickups for john mccain are women and reagan democrats
6035665 john mccains bipartisan immigration plan has been well received by many in the latino community evidenced by mccains dominance in winning the votes of latino republicans during the primary and caucus season
6035666 if the best solution that obama has is to 87
6035667 most of the eastern border of the state is conservative as well especially down in the southeast quadrant of the state where it is rural in the west texas sense very conservative small towns with lots of oil and that love high school football
6035668 the latino hispanic mexican american vote is largely democratic by registration and geography
6035669 while heavily hispanic counties voted for clinton during the 2008 presidential preference caucus the obama campaign is running a robust hispanic outreach program
6035670 the native american community in new mexico is heavily registered as democrats
6035671 these communities will definitely play an important role in turning new mexico blue this fall
6035672 there are a large number of independent voters in albuquerque and las cruces and sen mccain has a proven ability to connect these voters
6035673 he also has great appeal to native americans and we therefore expect him to perform better with the navajo nation and among new mexico s pueblo indian population
6035674 conservative democrats appreciate senator mccains willingness and ability to reach across the aisle a skill obama has never shown which reinforces his status as an unknown and incredibly inexperienced presidential candidate
6035675 mccain is willing to explore all options to create a comprehensive and successful energy plan for america barack obama on the other hand continues to simply say no to common sense energy solutions that could reduce gas prices now and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
6035676 voters in new mexico share the same concerns as small business owners families of servicemen and women in iraq or as commuters having a hard time paying for higher gas prices
6035677 barack obama is a candidate who will prioritize the concerns of working class families
6035678 voters who honor the life of the unborn and support traditional marriage will support senator mccain in large numbers
6035679 obama as with so many issues shows his incredibly liberal viewpoint on social issues that are so important to voters with a strong faith while a state senator he voted against allowing medical care to babies who survive an abortion procedure its hard to get farther left than that
6035680 many of those who populate the suburban towns around manchester and nashua left the state of massachusetts because they felt alienated by that states politics
6035681 but for the past two years new hampshire residents have lived under a democratic majority in the state legislature and the sky has not fallen
6035682 i do not think veterans are monolithic or that their votes hinge on issues involving the military or the war
6035683 new hampshire has relatively low church attendance and our evangelicals tend to be yankees that is more private about their faith than evangelicals in other parts of the country
6035684 mike huckabee only got 11 of the primary vote here
6035685 mccain has been here four times since winning the primary which speaks to his understanding of us a swing state
6035686 we looked at a number of competing products before selecting boardvantage on the basis of their superior functionality boardvantage has given us the ability to distribute our board materials online which in addition to the significant reduction in printing has enabled the corporate secretarys office to increase its efficiency and the timeliness of its communications
6035687 west pharmaceutical services is emblematic of the growing number of boards which is moving to a paperless environment thereby cutting down on waste and improving efficiency
6035688 we are proud to add this prestigious company to our growing customer base
6035689 this acquisition allows us to maintain our supply of high quality products and services and retain our position as a sustainable partner within the performance materials industry both consistency and security of supply are key considerations for our customers we are pleased that this step has given us a stronger position in being able to meet their requirements in the meantime we continue to invest in innovations new products and new technology development for our customers
6035690 the product diversification and customer segmentation initiatives commenced in q1 are now gaining traction
6035691 an impressive and growing list of new first tier clients coupled with a healthier revenue mix positions the company well as we enter our strongest two quarters of the year
6035692 the company has continued to bring expense levels in line with revenues
6035693 the changes move us very close to our goal of achieving sustained cash flow profitability
6035694 the two parallel shear zones appear to be part of a mineralized structure so we are encouraged by these early stage results over the next several months we have planned additional trenching and sampling as part of our ongoing evaluation of the property
6035695 everything was set and ready to go and then at the last minute cbs pulled the spot over concerns of showing too much skin
6035696 when the ad was pulled it was back to the drawing board we still needed to show the justus boyz underwear but had to be more creative
6035697 we were still up to the challenge even though we couldnt show a guy in his skivvies for an underwear ad fortunately the guys are so hot the new spot still gets the job done
6035698 it just goes to show how careful cbs has become since the infamous janet jackson justin timberlake wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 super bowl half time show produced by mtv the government clamped down so hard on them we cant blame cbs for being so cautious
6035699 the justus boyz all american masculine image is a natural fit for our athletic coverage we became aware of justus boyz because of their unique print advertising campaign which features athletic guys in their underwear there was one ad in particular showing an incredibly fit guy holding himself straight out parallel to the ground on a swinging gate to a corral it didnt seem possible but it turns out model chris whitlow was goofing around while the crew was preparing for another shot and stunned everyone at the photo shoot with his athletic abilities
6035700 we have spent considerable time and energy along with our accountants auditors and securities attorneys to get to this point and we are excited about the benefits that being on a higher exchange will bring to our company and its shareholders
6035701 even though we spent a lot of managements time on getting our audits completed we still have closed on a number of important contracts for our ballasts we just received a 250 000 purchase order from our west coast dealer and several smaller purchase orders from our major distributors
6035702 we recently attained commercial production at castillo as a result of the knowledge weve gained in the asset through this ramp up period weve also noted and began advancing opportunities to further create value the opportunities identified in the howe report are the next phase of the assets development that unlock this value however work doesnt stop there as we continue to see additional opportunities to further increase production and enhance value as we implement the howe report recommendations
6035703 this report identifies some of the value adding opportunities that originally attracted me to castle gold the report considers conservative life of mine estimates for the future gold price only limited future success in achieving operating efficiencies and doesnt consider any future increases in resources or reserves all of which are strong opportunities for additional value creation even under these conservative estimates the report suggests an approximate us 25 million increase in the npv of the project or the equivalent of c 0 35 per castle gold share if one considers these same conservative estimates for operating performance but includes average annual consensus gold price forecasts over the life of the mine by 25 global gold analysts the npv of the mine increases by us 61 million or about c 0 84 per castle gold share were excited to be advancing the recommendations of this report that will permit the company to achieve annualized gold production of in excess of 50 000 ounces of gold as the next stage of the projects development the stronger cash flow the project will generate will aid in financing further development of el castillo plus advance other exciting investment opportunities that exist within the company including development of the la fortuna gold silver copper project in mexico
6035704 the el castillo project is economically viable and robust under conservative operating scenarios

6035708 when youve got a community as big as ours theres a need to uphold a mutually agreeable value system
6035709 with our new justice system our community now has a self ruling mechanism that can grow and evolve at its own pace
6035710 in my experience the thing that has the most significant impact on a movies budget but never shows up in a budget is morale whats true for a movie is true for a startup if you have low morale for every 1 you spend you get about 25 cents of value if you have high morale for every 1 you spend you get about 3 of value companies should pay much more attention to morale
6035711 people who dont show their colors in the group but then get behind the scenes and peck away are poisonous i can usually spot those people fairly soon and i weed them out
6035712 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even
6035713 we know that consumers dont want to pull out and set up a second keyboard for a gaming session so we created a device that was perfect for both gaming and regular computer use

6035716 we do have other avenues to prove his innocence through submissions to the minister for home affairs and also the attorney general but we will use the legal system every opportunity thats available to him so we will appeal the decision try and get a review on the decision and well take it from there and see how it goes
6035717 were very excited to achieve this breakthrough of adding our x fi audio technology to a zen player setting the highest standard in audio quality for portable music players
6035718 some of the top recording artists in the music industry are very outspoken about the poor quality of digital music we addressed the issue of the poor quality of digital music by inventing x fi technology which restores the quality of music that is lost during the digital ripping process and now for the first time ever weve been able to implement this technology in a zen
6035719 with customers demanding personalised entertainment iptv service would allow subscribers more choice and control we will launch this service within this year
6035720 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 between 1979 and 1984 to 74 between 1996 and 2001 which is great news
6035721 but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6035722 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6035723 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6035724 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated
6035725 recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this

6035728 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
6035729 on the way home i said to my husband darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed
6035730 you know i was debating between kate beckinsale and this other chick but kate does talk about her lady bits a lot so im gonna go with her thats a tiebreaker
6035731 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6035732 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6035733 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals
6035734 and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
6035735 it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform
6035736 i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
6035737 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him

6035739 the people of abkhazia intend to ask the russian leadership to recognise abkhazia
6035740 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president
6035741 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
6035742 its the police who must deal with people like the leaders of separatists in abkhazia not me
6035743 so its ok to stray since she wasnt vomiting from chemo
6035744 the harsh reality is that for breast cancer there is no cure theres just what we call ned no evidence of disease its always lurking
6035745 i hate to think of all the women ive met who deal with body image issues and now with the edwards affair theyve got to worry that hubby will do the same thing this is going to be a real trigger
6035746 caregiving is hard the pressure can become overwhelming and there arent enough templates for how to deal with it in a healthy and holistic way when the pressure becomes overwhelming too many caregivers will get sick or do the john edwards thing it becomes an escape hatch
6035747 there have been an awful lot of partners thrown into the lake
6035748 ive never seen a situation where cancer and nothing else caused the relationship to splinter
6035749 a womans body is drying up which can make it very difficult to experience sexual intimacy
6035750 a lot of women have all kinds of fears that their partners will look elsewhere but if couples work together they can maintain their relationships
6035751 when you lose a breast you lose your feminine identity for a time
6035752 i found myself a rare man who was not at all deterred by the missing a breast thing
6035753 he always makes me feel beautiful so it was all for the best
6035754 this is a man who was allegedly involved in a substantial drugs transaction
6035755 the thought of him going to corfu having been involved on such a scale is something the public would have concerns about
6035756 if we believe in the goodness of god and if we believe in the sovereignty of christ how can we not believe in the ultimate triumph of righteousness

6035761 quickly suggested that was exactly what this book was about
6035762 total fertiliser subsidy is estimated to be rs 1 19 lakh crore in 2008 09 while we have made available rs 54 000 crore cash payment to the industry
6035763 finance ministry was putting ifs and buts but prime minister said there should be timely payment of subsidy as it is a matter related to farmers i thank prime minister for his personal intervention
6035764 when i joined the subsidy was rs 13 000 crore which has now increased to rs 1 19 000 crore but in last four years not a single penny burden has been imposed on farmers as there was no increase in prices of fertilisers we have reduced the prices of complex fertilisers by up to 19 per cent
6035765 it has been brought to the notice of the government that some of the existing commodity exchanges had foreign investment above the permitted level
6035766 the commodity exchanges will be required to divest foreign equity equal to the amount by which the cap was being exceeded
6035767 further no foreign investor or entity including persons acting in concert will hold more than five percent of the equity in these companies
6035768 egs could be the killer app of the energy world
6035769 one of the attractive aspects is that its baseload its 24 hour power and thats a nice complement to solar and wind which are intermittent sources
6035770 if you can put all three of these technologies together were going to have a much more attractive green electricity mix
6035771 path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal
6035772 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector
6035773 we have a new president and congress starting in november and were optimistic that whoever is elected president is going to seize the opportunity here and we expect support
6035774 geothermal power plants produce electricity about 90 of the time compared to 65 75 for fossil fuel power plants and causes virtually no greenhouse gas emissions today it is technically feasible to access enough geothermal power to meet all the worlds energy demands
6035775 while google is investing in 21st century energy solutions congress continues to be hung up on 19th century technologies like oil and coal

6035777 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6035778 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6035779 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6035780 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6035781 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6035782 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6035783 when are you going to understand that if it doesnt pertain to me im not interested
6035784 what keeps them up at night what are they worried about what is frustrating them
6035785 what am i going to live on when i retire

6035805 it isnt well fucking tell me why everyone has a best friend but me that one person thats as good as your family loves you no matter who you are no matter what you do
6035806 having some friends of one sort or another is better than having none at all
6035807 id rather be alone than have to feel like i cant trust anyone
6035808 ive used and wasted chances show me someone who gives a shit about me and i will give them whatever fucking bits of my heart are left
6035809 i could be i cant feel anything enough to know if its still there

6035816 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage

6035827 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what he is up against right now
6035828 i care about the country and they dont because they are america haters
6035829 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

6035832 i think that 1 3 million is the greatest shortfall we will see
6035833 all i can tell you is that it was never reported to the city council the way it is
6035834 as far as my personal feelings i can tell you ive never been more embarrassed in my whole life i feel like ive really let my citizens down but this is not something we cant overcome
6035835 the recovery from this is not going to be easy and were continuing to work on this
6035836 weve simply got to cut our budget as thin as we can and then weve got to have a tax increase
6035837 were basically going to have to set an amount for these different department heads and theyre going to have to work within that budget its not going to be easy and its not going to be very popular but our options are very limited

6035843 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6035844 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6035845 what kind of state is that which is able to nip terrorism in the bud and eliminate it does it not have to equip itself with its own terrorism and in doing so simply generalize terror at all levels what is the real price for such security and are we all seriously dreaming about this
6035846 what if the true problem is not the fragile status of the excluded but rather the fact that on the most elementary level we are all excluded in the sense that our most elementary zero position is that of an object of biopolitics and that possible political and citizenship rights are given to us as a secondary gesture

6035872 but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6035873 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6035874 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have

6035876 recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this

6035896 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6035897 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6035898 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6035899 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6035900 its been something weve been hoping would happen for so long and weve planned every detail

6035903 its really sad to think that if that meadowbank goes and nothing else replaces it then we could miss out on a future olympic champion somewhere
6035904 what we found when we were going round some of these caravan sites was that they were pretty substandard
6035905 accommodation was pretty basic no running water toilet facilities were poor there were no laundry facilities so we just felt something had to be done
6035906 all credit to the farmers and businesses in angus because they have agreed with us and the standard of accommodation now for our international and migrant workers is getting better by the day
6035907 at the end of the day if youre looking after a worker youll get a better return from it and the farmers that weve spoken to so far are delighted with the response from the migrant workers
6035908 its a 79m challenge we have the best possible springboard and momentum from beijing and i am absolutely confident that we will realise this goal

6035924 the chief rabbinate is willing to convert them but the government is saying it does not wish to allow these people to be candidates for conversion this is an unconscionable act requiring full cabinet approval every time a group of people wishes to move here and undergo conversion is a recipe for bureaucratic inertia as there is little chance of getting such an item onto the busy agenda of the entire government hence by creating a virtually insurmountable obstacle to approval sheetrit hopes to bury the issue once and for all why you might be wondering would sheetrit and his cabinet colleagues do such a thing
6035925 the answer is really quite simple it is post zionism of the ugliest sort tinged by prejudice and sheer ignorance

6035946 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6035947 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6035948 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6035949 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6035950 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6035951 theres no question this is an insider versus outsider campaign
6035952 im not surprised by those who are opposing us they want to control our legislature
6035953 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6035954 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6035955 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it

6035962 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6035963 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6035964 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6035965 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6035966 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6035967 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6035968 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6035969 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6035970 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted

6035989 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6035990 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6035991 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
6035992 i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
6035993 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

6036032 we have always lived in a brutally difficult product landscape in the late 1990s netscape had gone from a position of having enormous market share for the browsers probably as high as in the 90s i think before microsoft got involved to a steadily declining market share partly because microsoft is a great competitor and theyve built some good products and partly because they engaged in a campaign of illegal activities and then you combine those and the netscape market share had been dropping steadily for quite some time so its clear that the way of producing a browser and how we were trying to keep choice and alternatives alive had to be done differently thus open source
6036033 we looked at a number of competing products before selecting boardvantage on the basis of their superior functionality boardvantage has given us the ability to distribute our board materials online which in addition to the significant reduction in printing has enabled the corporate secretarys office to increase its efficiency and the timeliness of its communications

6036041 everything was set and ready to go and then at the last minute cbs pulled the spot over concerns of showing too much skin
6036042 when the ad was pulled it was back to the drawing board we still needed to show the justus boyz underwear but had to be more creative
6036043 we were still up to the challenge even though we couldnt show a guy in his skivvies for an underwear ad fortunately the guys are so hot the new spot still gets the job done
6036044 it just goes to show how careful cbs has become since the infamous janet jackson justin timberlake wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 super bowl half time show produced by mtv the government clamped down so hard on them we cant blame cbs for being so cautious
6036045 the justus boyz all american masculine image is a natural fit for our athletic coverage we became aware of justus boyz because of their unique print advertising campaign which features athletic guys in their underwear there was one ad in particular showing an incredibly fit guy holding himself straight out parallel to the ground on a swinging gate to a corral it didnt seem possible but it turns out model chris whitlow was goofing around while the crew was preparing for another shot and stunned everyone at the photo shoot with his athletic abilities

6036047 this report identifies some of the value adding opportunities that originally attracted me to castle gold the report considers conservative life of mine estimates for the future gold price only limited future success in achieving operating efficiencies and doesnt consider any future increases in resources or reserves all of which are strong opportunities for additional value creation even under these conservative estimates the report suggests an approximate us 25 million increase in the npv of the project or the equivalent of c 0 35 per castle gold share if one considers these same conservative estimates for operating performance but includes average annual consensus gold price forecasts over the life of the mine by 25 global gold analysts the npv of the mine increases by us 61 million or about c 0 84 per castle gold share were excited to be advancing the recommendations of this report that will permit the company to achieve annualized gold production of in excess of 50 000 ounces of gold as the next stage of the projects development the stronger cash flow the project will generate will aid in financing further development of el castillo plus advance other exciting investment opportunities that exist within the company including development of the la fortuna gold silver copper project in mexico
6036048 the el castillo project is economically viable and robust under conservative operating scenarios

6036076 im just taking it step by step this is the first little tick in the box and im very thankful to everybody at central coast
6036077 i feel very very fit ive still got a long way to go fitness wise and i think that will come with match practice
6036078 im looking forward in the next three weeks to getting back to a certain level that is comparable to where i was in the past
6036079 if i was fortunate enough to get an offer i would sit down with every one concerned who has an interest and who i care about and discuss that but i dont really think thats up to me
6036080 i can definitely see gabby and ashley breaking into the england side this season they can be as good as they want
6036081 they have great potential they have everything in front of them they are both young with fantastic skills and they can both succeed and go a long way in the game
6036082 it is the start of a new era for england and there is a good generation of players coming through i think they will be very strong in the years to come and gabby and ashley can be part of that
6036083 the good thing is the players want to learn gabby has improved so much in just my time here since january 2007 and i am sure he will continue to get even better
6036084 he can be as good as he wants to be and there is definitely more to come from him i also think all the young players at villa will reap the benefits of playing in europe this season

6036091 for our citizenship is in heaven from which we also eagerly wait for the saviour the lord jesus christ who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to his glorious body according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things to himself
6036092 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off were assured of them embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland and truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out they would have had opportunity to return but now they desire a better that is a heavenly country therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them
6036093 by faith moses when he became of age refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he looked to the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible
6036094 as sojourners and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conduct honorable among the gentiles that when they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they observe glorify god in the day of visitation

6036158 i am tempted by conway morriss belief that we should stop thinking of convergent evolution as a colourful rarirty to be remarked and marvelled at when we find it perhaps we should come to see it as a norm exceptions to which are occasions for surprise for example true syntactic language seems to be unique to one species our own perhaps and i shall return to it this is one thing that a re evolved brainy biped would lack in my opening chapter the conceit of hindsight i listened to warnings against seeking patterns rhymes or reasons in evolution but said that i would cautiously flirt with them the hosts return has provided an opportunity to sweep over the whole course of evolution in the forward direction and see what patterns we can descry the idea that all evolution was aimed at producing homo sapiens was certainly well rejected and nothing we have seen on our journey reinstates it even conway morris claims only that something approximately similar to our kind of animal is one of several outcomes others being insects for example that we would expect to see recurring if evolution were rerun again and again

6036181 the reintegration of iraq into the arab world is the principle objective that we should all work for
6036182 we discussed the details of how lebanon could cooperate with iraq in the oil sector and on oil investment including lebanese investment in iraqi oil fields
6036183 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6036184 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6036185 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6036186 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6036187 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6036188 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
6036189 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do

6036191 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6036192 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6036193 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6036194 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6036195 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6036196 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6036197 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6036198 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6036199 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6036200 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6036201 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6036202 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6036203 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6036204 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6036205 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6036206 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6036207 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6036208 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6036209 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6036210 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6036211 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6036212 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6036213 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6036214 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6036215 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6036216 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home

6036228 as i understand it the board cant alter it as it is certified but after the successful november vote the county board could reduce it in one quarter increments
6036229 the county board then may or may not adopt an ordinance imposing some all or none of the tax further the county board has the ability to reduce or eliminate the tax at any time unless doing so would inhibit a school boards ability to pay its bonds backed by the proceeds of the tax
6036230 it was a great deal of work to get it this far and hospice is so well known and appreciated that i really thought that they would do better
6036231 but i think a lot if it is that people are just not aware that its there
6036232 the governor with support from the general assembly has exercised fiscal responsibility in moving to tap surplus resources rather than raise taxes on the citizens of illinois
6036233 if the fund was beefed up it probably would have been swept we dont want to go through all that and have the money swept for someone else
6036234 ive been out there to visit and im so impressed with what they do and the fact that they are able to keep us so many of us in our homes in comfortable surroundings with our family present rather than in a hospital room that is very expensive hooked up to tubes and things that go beep in the night
6036235 it did not fulfill all the needs of the university
6036236 we the workers of this university have been accepting raises that are falling further and further below the rising cost of living and inflation for years now this is more than an insult it is an assault on working people and their families and it has to stop
6036237 a good day with a lot of things happening on campus
6036238 initially he wanted to go it alone with just his band and road crew but now he wants nancy to be with him all the way
6036239 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it
6036240 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
6036241 i found the stunt a lot more exhausting and physical than i expected it to be
6036242 i was wearing three weight belts to keep me on the seabed and i had to keep equalising yet try and look graceful being underwater was emotionally really liberating though
6036243 that could not be substantiated or were questionable at best
6036244 the accusation unfairly and without basis sullies the sterling reputation of mr altman
6036245 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6036246 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6036247 until they catch him they have to be out here
6036248 if i was the rapist and did all the attacks id be running forever
6036249 the new york yankees are dead they are not merely tapping the bucket with their tootsies sampling the dust with their teeth booking refundable tickets on the stygian ferry they are on line 1 with dr kevorkian asking for the soonest appointment possible

6036251 happy trails yankees it wont be the same without you
6036252 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6036253 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6036254 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6036255 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6036256 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6036257 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
6036258 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
6036259 both an increase and reaching a certain level of virus activity faster in the season
6036260 notorious for being focal and sporadic so finding one relatively small area that has higher transmission activity than other areas is more normal than abnormal
6036261 you put all these complicated factors together and in certain circumstances you could wind up with a situation that promotes more virus activity
6036262 so they have the knowledge to allow them to respond appropriately
6036263 it may be reassuring to know that that many people probably have immunities because they were infected in the past but never got sick
6036264 were trying to minimize the impact on people but its not easy because the work is invasive
6036265 i havent been able to get to my street for a month
6036266 this is such a big player in the regional economy this is the workhorse to know that its strong and vital thats a big deal
6036267 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
6036268 but they can also be taken away at any time
6036269 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
6036270 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
6036271 we have no records of these two names in our system
6036272 we are here because we must find a way to re engage these students for one reason or another we are not successful
6036273 were about just moving on and getting the work done with these young people
6036274 we expect to serve everybody here like the nordstroms of student services
6036275 so any young person that walks in that door will be welcomed with a smile and treated like the adults that they are
6036276 this is not a place where were going to give you a phone number and say go make the call yourself

6036717 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6036718 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6036719 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6036720 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there it has been a nightmare every second i was set up thats all i will say
6036721 but you wait all the time ive been inside ive been preparing for my book its all here in my head
6036722 im an innocent man and my book will show you that
6036723 glitter had been warned that he could legally only stay in the country for 12 hours my boss is getting impatient with him now
6036724 but that seems a poor option at the moment as the vietnamese authorities will probably just send him right back
6036725 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6036726 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6036727 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register

6036759 you can see the lack of talent that still exists here
6036760 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6036761 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6036762 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6036763 i am excited about having so many new food options in the fall it is definitely a welcome change because especially for dinner i would love to have access to similar stations to those of mallinckrodt now
6036764 this could provide a novel way for students to interact with their professors outside of the classroom
6036765 the student duc dining committee will be considering registered data over the course of the fall 2008 semester in order to make recommendations to bon appetit on both hours changes and quite possibly menu changes as well
6036766 though i am no longer a senator i will continue to serve on both committees as well as work closely with the new executive board of student union to improve the dining experience on campus
6036767 made fewer offers of admission up front and used the wait list to balance their enrollment to the right size
6036768 since our freshman enrollment can vary a bit and because its impossible to have a freshman class be exactly a certain size we employ the use of the wait list
6036769 our college counselors had already told us to expect being put on the wait list
6036770 its a little difficult because you dont know whether to start getting excited for one school or whether to wait to hear back
6036771 i enrolled at the university of michigan and i wasnt completely happy about going there
6036772 we love using the wait list it allows us to make a few more students happy and we love to admit students
6036773 washington university does not have plans to grow significantly the size of its undergraduate class but each year there will be fluctuations in the number of first year students who choose to come to washington university
6036774 as with most universities it is hard to predict the exact final number
6036775 students will get experience in the field of genomics an increasingly important area of biology research
6036776 i think the phage hunters course will be a more realistic experience with biology research than the typical introductory biology lab course
6036777 we will explore if hooking up differs along axes of gender sexual orientation class religion and ethnicity as well as class status
6036778 i hope students will leave the course understanding better the cultural phenomenon of hooking up and its historical contexts
6036779 everything appears to be on schedule and going as planned clayco the construction company has been a great company with whom to work their folks could not be more accommodating and responsive
6036780 as in any project theres been a few minor delays and or a few questions along the way
6036781 i got to tour the duc during one of the last couple of weeks of school and it looked great there was a lot more space for student union and just a lot more space for everyone
6036782 its going to be very nice very good conditions to work in
6036783 our goal is to get all members of the campus community into the building during its first year we think there is something for just about everyone within or in one of the courtyards around the center
6036784 if you walk around it now particularly the north side youre able to look in the windows and get a sense of what the first floor is shaping up to look like
6036785 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6036786 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6036787 no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him
6036788 by this we know love because he laid down his life for us
6036789 o jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you
6036790 in repentance and rest is your salvation in quietness and trust is your strength but you would have none of it
6036791 because you have rejected this message relied on oppression and depended on deceit 13 this sin will become for you like a high wall cracked and bulging that collapses suddenly in an instant 14 it will break in pieces like pottery shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern
6036792 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
6036793 its caught the heart of australians and at the moment the public is really really desperately wanting something to save the whale
6036794 it is possible it might not be probable but its possible that it could be picked up and adopted
6036795 as the calf is still being breast fed we have no way of feeding or socializing it
6036796 so taking this humpback into captivity is not an option
6036797 unless it can go out to open water and find a mother i dont really know whats going to happen
6036798 one of the failings of technology journalism over the years has often been a tendency to focus on the technical potential of new products to the exclusion of the present technical challenges that need to be overcome
6036799 in doing some further investigation it doesnt really look like these are solar companies it looks like these are opportunists that are setting up websites and opening an office and theyre just going around and taking advantage of unsuspecting people
6036800 i think that anytime you have a lot of government and public attention on going green people dont know really what that means and since customers dont tend to do a lot of due diligence themselves they really are taking on faith that the person whos selling them this product will treat them well i think thats the problem that i see picking up the green movement has brought in some snake oil type practices and thats very sad
6036801 when you put a solar system on your roof and it doesnt work nobody will be able to tell when you put a small wind turbine on your roof or in your backyard and it doesnt work the whole neighborhood knows that could have a lasting effect on someones opinion about wind we have to make sure people are making smart purchases so that we maintain confidence in these technologies
6036802 its great that people are looking for alternatives but its amazing how little people know when they seek them out that leaves people open to purchasing a product that is less than reliable we are a very gullible culture were always looking for the magic bullet
6036803 its critical for us to point out when companies are not answering questions theres a lot of hype around certain companies that are being very secretive and where theres real potential for not only investors to get hurt but also for the image of the industry to be hurt
6036804 to claim that you could do it for 1 50 a watt which is just a little more than a gas turbine it isnt physically possible you cant buy the materials and assemble a 16 000 pound dish for that it defies the laws of physics materials procurement and materials costs
6036805 theyre going to buy 12 000 engines that theyve never bought before and put them on dishes and expect to generate power its just highly unlikely theyre probably looking at 2020
6036806 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
6036807 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
6036808 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
6036809 we want to offer them transparency and choice about the options that are available to them
6036810 this is in addition to our existing opt out when yahoo serves customized advertising on third party networks
6036811 we believe this is particularly important since it is not always obvious to all users that ads are served by different entities among web sites
6036812 consistent with the terms of the providers existing customer notices and acceptable use policy which our customers must expressly accept to activate their broadband internet access service
6036813 additional steps to protect our customers privacy including confirming their interest in receiving tailored advertisements and by securing an additional opt in consent from them
6036814 customers shouldnt be required to read complex and confusing legal updates about privacy policy
6036815 the companies really failed to fully disclose all the data collection and targeting they routinely do
6036816 you would never know reading aols letter for example that it acquired behavioral targeting leader tacoda last year
6036817 aols letter to the hill is a fairy tale version of the targeting it can do
6036818 isnt there a high chance that at the age of 40 youll be highly trained and specialized but without a job
6036819 theres no job security in academia anyway im not sure if academia is more competitive than industry
6036820 after the initial boom in bioinformatics positions will the fraction of grad students who become pis approach biology with 5 to 10
6036821 biology will morph into bioinformatics so there will be more jobs
6036822 pattayas new walking street sign was said to be operational but frankly it is a huge disappointment the old sign was a landmark but this new monstrosity can only be described as an eyesore
6036823 it feels like i never left i feel right at home here
6036824 there is plenty of enthusiasm and the same team spirit that was already present before
6036825 austria didnt get great results in the summer but they played well and were unfortunate not to score more
6036826 its a fascinating idea but only if the attackers are ready to help the team in the defensive phase
6036827 i want to see some fighting spirit with players ready to make sacrifices even if were only in august and the domestic league hasnt started yet and i also want them to show their technical quality
6036828 i scored in the uefa champions league third qualifying round against sk slavia praha and now i want to get a goal with italy as well being back in the squad is fantastic the usual enthusiasm is there and i hope this will be the start of another great period for the national team
6036829 es geht immer darum wie k nnen wir den deutschen fu ball insgesamt verbessern
6036830 ich habe mich ertappt dass die vorfreude schon wieder gro ist

6036832 man muss ber ausbildungsinhalte reden wir werden sicher ber inhaltliche und personelle nderungen sprechen
6036833 auf der einen seite m ssen wir uns f r die wm qualifizieren und wollen uns den stress der relegationsspiele ersparen auf der anderen seite wollen wir weiter junge spieler integrieren das muss parallel laufen
6036834 man muss berlegen macht so eine reise sinn oder macht man mal einen l ngeren lehrgang
6036835 jedes l nderspiel hat auch eine gro e wirtschaftliche kraft da muss man abw gen
6036836 auf jeden fall wollen wir die leistungstests wieder mehr einflie en lassen
6036837 sobald wir das gef hl haben dass einer unsere nummer eins ist werden wir uns auch festlegen und diesem torwart bedingungslos den r cken st rken
6036838 wir haben jetzt aber nicht die situation wie fr her schon h ufiger dass eine langj hrige nummer zwei zur nummer eins aufr ckt

6036851 i hope its a physical challenge and then ill take you off the block
6036852 it has been a real pleasure ill be coming back but next time as a tourist because i think this is a beautiful place
6036853 it is very unusual to find a school out of term time full of children but that is what we have here
6036854 it is a real indication of how keen they are to help the community
6036855 what we really look for is community input with as wide a range of people and organisations involved as possible
6036856 i have to say im very impressed with the community spirit in forres
6036857 we managed to show the judges many different aspects of forres and all the way through it were the children the fibbees in their garden by the grant park car park pilmuir school and applegrove the judges were very impressed by them
6036858 everywhere looked great we couldnt do anything more and no matter how the results go i really think we are all winners living in this community
6036859 just days before the judges were due to arrive a representative of the lidl supermarket phoned me and offered two of their landscape workers to help with anything we needed help with
6036860 lidl paid their wages and the two men worked on the roundabouts on the approach to forres to ensure they looked their best
6036861 not a lot of people would think of doing that
6036862 we adopted the whole road from the legion to the loch
6036863 we have gone out at 6 30 every tuesday morning since may now we would like more people to join us
6036864 it is not an effort forres in bloom will supply rubbish pickers and it is very rewarding
6036865 ive just heard that every street on jersey has been adopted so there is no reason why we cant get every street in forres adopted we feel we should be the first scottish community to have a volunteer for every street
6036866 you do as much as you can every time you walk along your street you pick up litter or weeds
6036867 the judges certainly seemed to like what they were seeing
6036868 they were paying compliments all the way round they were particularly impressed by the range of bedding plants plants they didnt expect to see so far north
6036869 they even commented on the grass cutting in grant park
6036870 amenity grass areas have come in for criticism in the past but they must have been impressed by the striping in the park which was done by jim robson who takes lots of pride it in
6036871 they cannot be praised enough and i know that the people of forres are really grateful for their efforts
6036872 the success of forres is down to a unique community spirit which brings together the committee local moray council staff the schools and a whole lot of volunteers who ensure forres is the tremendous success it is
6036873 this year the gardens and town are particularly beautiful with the warm vivid colours in the grant park hanging baskets and barrels all over the town
6036874 this is mainly due to the forres in bloom team moray council and the community spirit of the people of forres who want to see forres obtain gold this year in the britain in bloom competition
6036875 the judges made comment on the beauty of the town and the willingness for all to work towards this one goal i for one would like to see all the hard work complemented by winning gold
6036876 it proves what can be done by people working together
6036877 i was particularly impressed by the wee fibbees and the pilmuir project
6036878 this is good news the fact that woodlands are community features hasnt always affected the reporters decisions
6036879 since the trees are now seen as an important feature they need to be managed
6036880 there has been talk that we could all get together and offer to buy the land but obviously thats not up to us and depends on the owner
6036881 at the inquiry the council said that the trees were insignificant
6036882 they are not insignificant they are a part of the local landscape you can even see them from the culbin forest viewing platform without binoculars they are part of the landscape and it is good that a green space is being retained there are too many green spaces being lost to housing development in forres
6036883 perhaps we could do the same as residents in drumduan have done
6036884 as charming as this artistic paeon is why is it classified as an op ed piece
6036885 i saw a red balloon and i knew it was coming to get me
6036886 great trains flash briefly by the long red row of tenement houses south of 125th street dive with a roar into the two and one half mile tunnel which burrows beneath the glitter and swank of park avenue and then sound effect of a train pulling into the station grand central station crossroads of a million private lives gigantic stage on which are played a thousand dramas daily
6036887 the kiss is particularly interesting to me as it s one of the best things we all get to do

6036904 on behalf of everyone at the fa id like to offer congratulations to john terry following fabio capellos decision to make him englands permanent captain
6036905 john obviously has tremendous leadership qualities and it is clear how much the captaincy means to him he has our full support
6036906 i know that fabio capello thought long and hard before making this decision and it is clear that we have a number of leaders within the team

6036925 oh my word id like to see someone eat off a rhinos body
6036926 probably people mess with rhinos all the time do that to me theyre going to have a hard time though
6036927 this will not be your typical sports video in that the action from start to finish is shown we will certainly focus on the action but more importantly we will be profiling 10 lifters from the competition and showing more about the people that participate in the sport of powerlifting as well as the sport of powerlifting itself my intention is to market this production to the likes of spiketv and other similar channels with the goal being to get the documentary on tv

6036940 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6036941 we believe we are as good as kilkenny in fact as good as any opposition on a given day and if we can reproduce the hurling and the never say die spirit that held tipp at bay is there any good reason why we cant do the same in the final

6036944 we thought at the beginning that they were just asking for a tenner a week so we said yeah take it out of our wages
6036945 but then we were told it was a 2 000 loan which they said works out at 10 a week for the next four years
6036946 we said its impossible because obviously the players are only on one year contracts so if youre not at the club next year youll still be paying back a loan for cobh ramblers it doesnt make sense
6036947 if youre asking me whether well still be going if the revenue doesnt keep coming in through the turnstiles we wont

6036966 senator obama in the illinois state legislature voted against a ban on partial birth abortion eighty percent of the american people want to ban partial birth abortion its a hideous procedure he voted against a bill that would have provided services to children that would have survived an abortion his position on life issues is incredibly extreme as it is on some others
6036967 senator obama has been and is committed to reducing unintended pregnancies but strongly supports a womans right to choose hes long been a consistent champion of womens health issues but will preserve a womens right under the law
6036968 this is the classic republican response gin up interest motivate the base get them excited about some issue that is largely created abortion is one of those issues and then distract them from issues that matter most like the economy
6036969 if you were to ask somebody in gallipolis what the number one issue is in their mind theyre not going to say abortion theyre not going to say gay marriage theyre going to say the economy the cost of gas and ending the war in iraq and on each of those substance issues we are right

6037004 all the girls are pretty fit having played championship all summer and i dont think that will be an issue each team will have three substitutes and we will be rotating players throughout the night its going to be tough but the main thing is that we enjoy it

6037006 there will be someone from the guinness book of records down here recording everything to make sure its done right and one of the most important things is making sure the ball is in play all the time

6037043 this is a momentous day in history and a work in progress
6037044 today as we put forth this bill i reaffirm my position on managing growth to ensure the best quality of life for the citizens of harford county to enjoy the beauty natural resources and environment for years to come
6037045 this is not a democrat or republican issue but a quality of life issue about keeping in place what we call home
6037046 they have narrowed the scope of citizen input and made major changes in citizens ability to get information
6037047 it also limits our ability to appeal a zoning decision without going to the courts and forking over thousands of dollars
6037048 we had good guidance in our discussions spent time on the substantive issues and engaged in debate
6037049 they showed us pretty maps but did little to explain
6037050 no one learned from anyone else this zoning code is for the citizens of harford county who therefore should have a significant role in its outcome
6037051 we want to work with community groups to incorporate what they want into this bill
6037052 we need to be progressive but we also must protect our watersheds preserve our ag land and heritage and grow in the right places

6037073 it fascinates me to have a national team with three attackers who can make themselves available for the team like wayne rooney did for manchester united in rome in the champions league last season
6037074 its bad news for holland that they went out but it means we get a player back hopefully he can be here either today or tomorrow to train with the rest of his team mates
6037075 he has been playing important games so i dont think there will be any problems with his fitness but our doctor and fitness coaches will check with him and then we will see about the weekend
6037076 i am sure he will be okay if he trains normally then he can be available for middlesbrough
6037077 all the players are trying to make an impression all i can do is give 100 per cent and try to get back in the squad its not a problem for me being in the under 21s i will just give 100 per cent for them and hopefully it will be enough to get back into the senior squad
6037078 we have got a good group of lads here with the under 21s and it is not just me who could move up there is james milner and i dont want to name names but there are loads of us that can move up and hopefully we will do
6037079 it was a mixed bag i know we can play better than that but you can never underestimate winning especially at international level if you asked me what i was looking for going into the game obviously a clean sheet obviously a few goals and a good performance
6037080 i did not get everything i was looking for and we can pass the ball the better and we can play better but every step at this age group is a learning curve for the players
6037081 we had maybe five or six players that competed for their clubs on sunday so obviously we were aware of that situation and maybe one or two had not featured for their clubs yet this season but we will go away and have a look at it when we meet with the coaches and it will stand us in good stead ahead of the portugal game
6037082 this is really the biggest paradigm shift in innovation since the industrial revolution
6037083 for a couple hundred years or so manufacturers have been really imperfect at understanding peoples needs now people get to decide what they want for themselves

6037215 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6037216 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6037217 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6037218 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6037282 we have built a robust infrastructure that can support a very large operation of franchised and corporate stores
6037283 all of our stores provide delivery and catering services the market response to catering has been tremendous in the stores that are really rolling out catering in their communities it is showing up as 10 20 of their sales the most logical extension to increase unit volumes for us is catering because it hits the same day part at the same time as long as a store is capable operationally of handling it it is the easiest one to go after because you are going to them and they are coming to you at the same day time
6037284 interestingly the fast casual segment and lunch segment have probably been the least affected people like to get out of the office at lunchtime and people still have office meetings and require catering the casual and fine dining segments are being impacted much more significantly that fast casual
6037285 we have projected revenues for 2008 of 4 million from corporate stores and franchise fees in order to become profitable we need somewhere between 75 100 operating stores the exact number will depend upon the mix of corporate to franchise stores
6037286 there is no fundamental reason for the decline in our stock price we have over 5 000 shareholders for a small bulletin board company that is a lot of shareholders so we have a very widespread interest in the stock the stock also supports itself very well at those levels i think the stock should be a little higher than it is right now

6037307 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6037308 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6037309 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6037310 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his

6037312 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6037313 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6037314 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6037315 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6037316 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6037317 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6037318 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6037319 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6037320 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6037321 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6037322 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6037323 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6037324 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6037325 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6037326 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6037327 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6037328 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6037329 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6037330 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6037331 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6037332 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6037333 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6037334 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6037335 i hope you will support my work on amtrak as much as i have supported you

6037487 chris jericho is the single greatest thing on any wrestling show right now
6037488 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
6037489 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
6037490 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
6037491 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
6037492 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
6037493 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6037494 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6037495 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
6037496 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6037497 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law

6037501 apb ist ein ehrgeiziges projekt das millionen von spielern eine lebendige spielumgebung und actiongeladenes gameplay bietet um das umzusetzen ben tigen wir eine herausragende engine f r realistische 3d und echtzeit physikberechnungen deshalb setzen wir bei der entwicklung von apb auf nvidia gpus und die physx technologie
6037502 wir freuen uns dass realtime worlds die physx technologie f r apb nutzt

6037505 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6037506 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6037507 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6037508 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
6037509 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6037510 things are pretty fragile down there the infrastructure is all intact but if they have another flood it may not hold a second time
6037511 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
6037512 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6037513 were gong to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6037514 telephony is critical to the success of our company and gohello tm has enabled an easy to use mobile service which our employees love and requires no technical expertise or understanding i would highly recommend gohellos allmobile telephony to anyone wanting to move away from the restrictions and complications of a fixed line phone system
6037515 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business
6037516 die impuls fr hst cke in unserer agentur setzen die kommunikation von unternehmen der it branche auf die richtige schiene in den kurzen und effizienten meetings identifizieren wir schnell die m glichen schwachpunkte in der eigendarstellung und der kommunikation und geben erste impulse wie die weichen gestellt werden k nnen resultate der knackigen meetings sind sehr unterschiedlich und individuell und reichen von der strategischen positionierung ber leadgenerierung bis hin zum imageaufbau durch pressearbeit auch das interesse an unserem gef rderten gr ndungscoaching programm ist enorm
6037517 unser neues b ro im alten bahnhof bietet hierzu die notwendige inspirierende atmosph re sowie eine hervorragende technische infrastruktur schlie lich sind ja hightech firmen unsere klientel
6037518 das ist ein prima resultat wir haben das was m glich war herausgeholt und unser ziel erreicht bester benziner zu sein das team hat uns das auto hervorragend vorbereitet
6037519 ich hatte danach m chtig zu tun um meine position zu verteidigen am ende musste ich dann noch knapp einen platz abgeben
6037520 wir wollten auf dem n rburgring eigentlich um die podestpl tze mitfahren von daher ist das ergebnis insgesamt am ende entt uschend
6037521 doch bei solchen unfallgeschichten die halt im motorsport passieren kann man nichts machen philip hat mit dem besch digten auto noch das beste aus der situation herausgeholt
6037522 scarred on mtv a few years ago i fell while rollerblading and my arm looked like something off that show its still kinda crooked to this day
6037523 the correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom
6037524 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
6037525 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
6037526 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
6037527 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
6037528 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
6037529 my agents spoke with other teams but as far as signing there was none of them
6037530 to have that taken away from you that can be really hard
6037531 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
6037532 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
6037533 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling
6037534 red means stop green means go yellow means go very very fast

6037547 the snowball effect hello and welcome to another month at recyclingcds i know what youre thinking snowballs in august not very seasonal is it and whilst the weather seems to be very changeable of late were not forecasting hailstones just yet what we are predicting however are incredible lifestyle changes approaching we know that charity begins at home but did you know that changing the world starts there too change begins with very small and delicate steps taken by individuals like you and i when nurtured these steps gradually build and join forces with all the other very small steps taken by all the other like minded people around us and then one day we realise that a powerful movement has been born and before we know it a change to the status quo has taken place and we can barely remember the time before the change thus every small step we can take now towards a more sustainable future and every positive meaningful change we can make to our everyday habits is vitally important from refusing to purchase over packaged items at the supermarket composting our kitchen waste and finding new uses for what we previously regarded as rubbish to buying pre loved instead of brand new clothing and furniture using public transport and walking whenever possible and moving our banking and utilities to ethical suppliers all these decisions which may not seem particularly life changing on their own when combined add up to significant change that will make a valuable positive difference to both our own lives and that of our future generations so if youre feeling a jaded shade of green convinced that you can only make a limited amount of positive difference by yourself fret not just like a tiny snowflake in a huge snowball every little bit counts and you are definitely not alone the movement whether we call it green eco slow ethical sustainable or something else entirely is most certainly out there and in here it has begun and you are part of it to ensure your little snowflakes of positive change dont melt away before they hit the ground join forces with a friend a neighbour an online forum or local group and watch what happens when lots of individual flakes of snow get together to support each other in the same direction before long snowflakes become snowballs snowballs become snowdrifts and suddenly there is snow everywhere magical recyclingcds is here to help snowflakes turn into snowstorms feel free to get in touch if you have any questions ideas or suggestions to help bring on the snow and if youre feeling stranded there are heaps of links to other snowflakes on our forums get out there and enjoy the weather news one of the groups recyclingcds has joined forces with this month are the lovely people at my zero waste you may have heard of this family from gloucestershire who have assigned themselves the not nearly as easy as it looks task of reducing the amount of waste they send to landfill the team have been measuring their rubbish on a weekly basis and hope to achieve a status of zero waste the my zero waste website is full of articles on reducing waste generated from food general household and personal products as well as interesting polls and competitions which is where we come in alongside a host of other cool eco sites recyclingcds has donated a prize that you can win simply by completing an entry form making a pledge to reduce your own landfill and submitting feedback for each pledge completed the more pledges you sign up to and comment on the greater your chance of winning a prize there are heaps to choose from including our own stunning frog cdclock or a gossypium duvet cover neals yard relaxation set an ecover cleaning kit ecocentric bathroom accessories and so much more visit my zero waste for your chance to win

6037549 i dont think wed be spending the money weve spent on the stadium this summer if we were planning to move out next year
6037550 once the stadium is sold out five times over well look at opportunities and there might be opportunities at the stadium itself its too early to write off what we might be able to do here
6037551 weve got to stay focused on getting to the premier league and the location here is very important to the owners they bought into it because of the clubs history and the fact that its synonymous with this area
6037552 we feel very positive about playing at loftus road it gives us a good atmosphere and creates a 12th man on the pitch
6037553 traditionally weve had a very active role in the community
6037554 were investing in our football in the community scheme to help us extend that role further and engage with people who might have got out of the habit of going to qpr
6037555 we want to give them a motivating reason to get down to loftus road and well welcome them with open arms
6037556 i know john spicer from when i was arsenal so itll be good to play against him on saturday
6037557 everyone saw what bristol city did last season so we know what you can expect from a team thats just come up
6037558 from what ive heard sean odriscolls a good manager who likes to play attractive football so it should be a good game but the focus will be on our team and what we can do
6037559 were at home were strong there and well be looking to bounce back from sheffield united
6037560 every game we play we have to stay focused and do what the gaffer says
6037561 i dont think thats an excuse really were all experienced enough
6037562 we just need to have more shape as a team
6037563 i made a big mistake for the first goal i didnt watch the man so tactics went out of the window we never recovered from that and it was a disappointing day
6037564 there are big expectations and we need to deliver especially away from home because last season our away form wasnt good enough and thats the reason we were where we were
6037565 i see it two ways the expectation should be now that winning the game is feasible and we should win the reality is once you get into the game who knows what happens because these games are so unpredictable at the end of the day if a point is what you get take it and you are happy with it because you are taking points away from them at home but i feel like we should win the game we are clearly a better team better players better prepared but if you get a point you take it
6037566 i have heard a lot of things ive told everyone who has asked at this stage in my career i am no longer a newcomer or a youngster i prefer to not speak much on transfer options i let rumors be rumors i am focused on the reality and at this point i am at standard liege and i havent been transferred yet if that were to happen in the next couple weeks that would be the reality and we would be having a different conversation right now i am just focused on my club and my national team i like being in liege and weve had a lot of success and i am definitely enjoying my lifestyle there at the same time i do have aspirations of playing at a higher level someday its the last year of my contract and liege would want to sell him before he became a free agent you can put two and two together if you want im not a math teacher so well see what they do
6037567 i love it where i am but ill be living in a new city before august 31
6037568 i am a little worried but im confident it will go through there is always that little sense of concern
6037569 there have been times in the last year and a half where i think we have been able to help in that regard you know that it is there but at the same time when you are in a world cup qualifier everybody understands that the focus is only on the decisions that help the team win
6037570 i talked to him briefly over the weekend when he was still considering and figuring out what he was going to do it was nice to hear his voice and i am excited about it it is easy to have an expectation that he is going to turn us into a champion in two weeks the reality is we havent been to the playoffs in two years we are struggling right now so while short term i think he is going to help us this year long term his abilities as a people manager as an organizer that is where we are going to see massive benefits down the road putting the right people in place having a structure and a vision i want him to do well we both have a bad taste left from the 2006 world cup i feel personally responsible because i feel i could have done more so i will be very motivated to succeed myself but to help him succeed as well
6037571 i will be back but whether i play i would highly doubt it you never know my guess is carlos ruiz wont be back but i dont know laughing my guess is carlos will be in guatemala for a few days if i know him correctly
6037572 well if you are up for a long term placement then i would say okay but otherwise this child will not be adopted for a very very long time

6037591 it will give us confidence especially if we win the next match
6037592 we need to play well at home next week but this point is a great start and hopefully we have shown people how we can play
6037593 it was so important to get a point at old trafford because it is such a difficult place to play they won the last title so for us it is a very good point
6037594 it was very quick the pace was so quick and it was throughout the whole match
6037595 this year we plan to hire more people into the services amp software unit than the number of affected employees so we expect that many employees will be able to transition to new jobs within nokia
6037596 we have made great progress with the initial offering this year and i see great potential going forward as we bring context aware internet services to peoples pockets these changes will strengthen our offerings and enable us to accelerate the delivery of new internet experiences to market
6037597 it is a highly sophisticated project with a simple objective to ensure we get the right people to the right job at the right time
6037598 it has been designed to speed up our response to customers problems such as leaks or loss of supply and is part of united utilities strategy to become a world class operator of utility infrastructure
6037599 this is the first time such a project has taken place in the water industry and it will improve our reaction time and efficiency enormously
6037600 it will analyse everything we do and we will be able to see at a glance the progress on every job should anything start to fall behind schedule we will be alerted immediately and will be able to rectify the problem
6037601 we are working with united utilities on this important project at a time when the efficiency and customer service delivered by utilities companies is high on the agenda the partnership exemplifies ibms commitment to working with energy amp utility clients on projects that will bring about major changes in their business working with them towards their vision for the future
6037602 to support their business change united utilities needed a robust and wide ranging workforce management solution together with ibm we are working with united utilities to roll out saps industry specific applications for utilities across their business from handling the initial telephone call at the call centre through to the mobile computers used by the field engineers
6037603 we are pleased to be working with hovon one of the most prestigious clinical groups in hematology oncology we continue to believe that cloretazine r will have broad utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies this trial will provide important data with regard to cloretazine r s utility in the treatment of aml when given in combination with standard remission induction therapy for this devastating disease
6037604 hovon is focusing on the clinical development of new therapeutic options for patients with leukemia laromustine is a promising agent for that effort
6037605 these data provide clinical evidence of ranolazines activity at the late sodium channel and provide important additional information about the very interesting electrophysiological properties of the drug
6037606 the results from our initial phase 1 trial were quite good with over 90 percent of subjects achieving detectable immune responses against hiv after the prime boost vaccination we hope to improve the breadth and magnitude of immune responses in the next clinical trial by using the vaxfectin r adjuvant with our dna priming vaccine we believe that continued development of hiv vaccines remains among the worlds top healthcare priorities

6037610 but the structure of many floral traits cannot i believe be understood unless we take into consideration not only the contrivances for securing the services of the proper insect or bird but also the contrivances for preventing insects that would not be useful from obtaining access to the nectar thus the immense length of the nectary of angraecum sesquipedale of madagascar might perhaps have been completely explained by mr wallace if this important purpose had been taken into account
6037611 i have no doubt of the truth of this principle but it is hardly applicable here as the moth has to be compelled to drive its proboscis as deeply down as possible into the flower

6037658 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
6037659 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
6037660 it probably should have been announced three four five years ago
6037661 technically javafx enables me to leverage the java skill set and java technology that i am more comfortable with to deliver a compelling ria solution because synergy between javafx and java is excellent and the fact that javafx is built on the java platform means that i can ensure that i have one of the best and supportive platforms to work in in addition javafx will enable me to be more productive in making it easier and quicker to create ria solutions

6037723 seit jahren k mpft die sozialistische jugend gegen den rassistischen gegenwind der von seiten der rechten parlamentsparteien weht die jahrelange ausgrenzungspolitik von vp bz und fp hat ihre spuren hinterlassen angefangen bei der strukturellen benachteiligung von migrantinnen bei der job und wohnungssuche ber die verh hnung des sterreichischen rechtsstaates in der k rntner ortstafelcausa bis hin zur unmenschlichen abschiebepraxis im asylwesen ist sterreichs integrations und migrationspolitik von fremdenfeindlichkeit gepr gt
6037724 es kann nicht angehen dass permanent auf den rechten der minderheiten herumgetrampelt wird dass migrantinnen angst vor k rperlichen bergriffen haben m ssen dass asylwerberinnen monatelang in schubhaft sitzen m ssen und trotz jahrelangem aufenthalt von abschiebung bedroht sind hier muss es endlich ein umdenken in der integrationspolitik geben damit migrantinnen dieselben lebens und bildungschancen erm glicht werden wie menschen die in sterreich geboren wurden
6037725 gerade im bereich des innenministeriums gibt es dringenden handlungsbedarf gewaltsame bergriffe auf personen mit migrantischem hintergrund werden immer mehr auch die polizei ist hier nicht unbeteiligt es braucht dringend mehr schulungsma nahmen f r polizeikr fte und vor allem mehr migrantinnen im ffentlichen dienst

6037727 das ma nahmenpaket zur jugendbesch ftigung muss sofort von sp und vp umgesetzt werden jeder jugendlicher hat das recht auf lehrausbildung und daher muss mit den vereinbarten zusatzma nahmen diese garantie wirksam gemacht werden
6037728 einerseits klagen die wirtschaftsvertreter und die vp st ndig ber den fachkr ftemangel und andererseits stehen sie bei der umsetzung der ausbildungsgarantie auf der bremse dabei w re gerade die investition in die ausbildung unserer jugendlichen die wirksamste pr ventionsma name zum fachkr ftemangel
6037729 die gewerkschaftsjugend malt keinesfalls den teufel an die wand wenn sie die 10 000 lehrstellen suchenden thematisiert die nun einmal ein faktum sind
6037730 der gj ist das schicksal von jeder und jedem einzelnen jugendlichen die der ohne ausbildung dasteht ein anliegen deshalb werden wir so lange druck machen bis wirklich alle den ausbildungsplatz bekommen den sie suchen das bedeutet f r die gj ausbildungsgarantie
6037731 wir werden genau beobachten ob die ausbildungsgarantie dann wirklichkeit ist solange das nicht der fall ist werden wir weiter auf fehlende lehrstellen aufmerksam machen auch wenn das staatssekret rin marek nicht gef llt
6037732 die aussage von frau kollegin klicka systemisierte betten k nnten ohne aufwand in ein tagesklinisches bett umgewandelt werden ist wirtschaftlich gesehen ein desaster
6037733 wenn station re betten dazu dienen tagesklinik patienten aufzunehmen ist das ungef hr so als w rde man ein hotelzimmer bezahlen obwohl man vorhat zu hause zu n chtigen
6037734 jedes jahr ben tigt der kav mehr geld an offiziellem betriebskostenzuschuss zur defizitdeckung von der stadt wien als im jahr davor im letzten jahr waren es bereits ber 717 millionen euro
6037735 2003 kam man noch mit knapp 1 milliarde aus es ist also h chste zeit f r strukturbereinigungen
6037736 diese aussagen sind ungeheuerlich und werden von mir auf das sch rfste zur ckgewiesen
6037737 die dornenkrone war schon in den landesfestz gen der jahre 1959 und 1984 symbol f r die zerrei ung des landes tirol sie zeigt auf dass die s dtiroler trotz lokaler autonomierechte fremdbestimmt in einem fremden staat leben m ssen sie soll nicht als provokation sondern als denkansto dienen ein prozess der auch den beiden landeshauptleuten anzuraten w re
6037738 beiden landeshauptleuten sei an dieser stelle gesagt dass es sich bei dem von ihnen ausge bten um ein auf zeit verliehenes amt handelt
6037739 die tiroler auf beiden seiten der unrechtsgrenze am brenner werden bei n chster gelegenheit solche aussagen zu bewerten wissen platter ist ja berdies kurioserweise landeshauptmann ohne sich der tiroler bev lkerung zur wahl gestellt zu haben mit luis durnwalder hat die r mische regierung einen mann in bozen sitzen der seit jahren italienische interessen in den vordergrund seiner politischen t tigkeit stellt
6037740 auch der sehnliche wunsch der italienischen nationalisten und faschisten den s dtirolern endlich die italianisierung aufzuzwingen besteht unver ndert
6037741 gehegt und gepflegt von der staatsmacht sind auch die zahlreichen faschistischen
6037742 platter und durnwalder haben es zu unterlassen den veranstaltungsteilnehmern in der art ihrer durchf hrung der veranstaltung hinsichtlich der dornenkrone auch nur irgendwelche einschr nkungen aufzuerlegen
6037743 wir freiheitliche werden das tragen der dornenkrone so lange unterst tzen solange das land tirol zerrissen ist es zwei landeshauptleute gibt und die landeseinheit nicht wieder hergestellt ist
6037744 ich hoffe sehr dass es zu keinen staatspolitischen bockspr ngen kommt
6037745 mein stil ist ein anderer es ist nicht unbedingt notwendig widersacher mit negativargumenten kaputt zu machen
6037746 da muss ich ausnahmsweise zu worten von j rg haider kommen der da sagt es gibt nur ein original
6037747 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6037748 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6037749 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6037750 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6037751 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6037752 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6037753 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6037754 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6037755 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6037756 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6037757 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6037758 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6037759 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6037760 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6037761 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6037762 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6037763 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6037764 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6037765 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6037766 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6037819 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
6037820 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
6037821 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6037822 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
6037823 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6037824 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6037825 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
6037826 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
6037827 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
6037828 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6037829 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6037830 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
6037831 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

6037835 we told them were going to work with our existing operations and that we intend to bring in all of the clinton finance supporters for full impact
6037836 they were a first class team in hosting the hillary clinton new jersey finance team which will continue to work closely with the hillary new jersey political team headed by gov corzine senator bob menendez joe cryan frank pallone joe roberts and the obama team cory booker mark alexander tricia mueller and jenny yeager in helping unite the party for a november democratic victory
6037837 obamas people were respectful very happy and very grateful to have our support
6037838 this election has been tightening up and new jersey is critical as well

6037844 a journalist at the event told me the men asked about me and wanted to know what newspaper i worked for
6037845 the police have no policy of photographing people except to document illegal activities and to keep as evidence in case of a complaint against police
6037846 we have no need to photograph moneaksekar khmer journalists there is nothing to see there
6037847 when families from different cultures walk past the display windows of the major chains there is nothing to tell them that there are books for them inside the store
6037848 the feedback we get suggests that consumers in local communities do not feel that their needs are being met booksellers think that they know what will sell and that books with pictures of black or asian children on the cover wont find a market that is not the case
6037849 there is no reason why these books wouldnt appeal to any child or family
6037850 our books have always appealed to trade booksellers in big cities such as birmingham and london but we believe that that there is more general demand
6037851 our books are about everyday events in childrens lives these messages are universal about shared experiences and adventures aimed at building childrens confidence

6037854 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6037855 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar
6037856 i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6037857 if you follow a vigorous workout program plus this eating program it is possible to lose up to 12 pounds in 30 days in a very healthy non fad like way

6037859 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6037860 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6037861 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6037862 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6037863 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6037864 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6037865 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6037866 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6037867 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6037868 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6037869 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6037870 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6037871 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6037872 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6037873 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6037874 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6037875 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6037876 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6037877 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6037878 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6037879 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6037880 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6037881 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6037882 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6037883 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6037884 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6037887 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6037888 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6037889 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6037890 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6037891 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6037892 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6037893 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6037954 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6037955 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6037956 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6037957 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6037958 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6037959 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6037960 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6037961 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6037962 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6037963 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6037964 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6037965 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6037966 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6037967 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6037968 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6037969 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6037970 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6037971 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6037972 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6037973 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6037974 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6037975 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6037976 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero

6037978 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6037979 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6037980 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6037981 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6037982 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6037983 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6037984 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6037985 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6037986 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6037987 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6037988 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6037989 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6037990 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6037991 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6037992 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6037993 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6037994 socialtext customers using our business social software platform and collaborating with socialtext wikis can be assured that our on demand service is secure and reliable

6037996 program members can quickly take advantage of advanced intel technologies and create more secure solutions without committing additional development resources helping them improve competitive advantage in the marketplace
6037997 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6037998 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6037999 we knew it was going to be a big deal for us to make the final
6038000 were really excited about it its a huge deal for us we havent even caught our breath yet
6038001 after our heat where they finished fourth and last but still advanced we were kind of wondering what was up and if we were going to be able to compete but we really turned it around for the semis im really really happy for sure
6038002 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6038003 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6038004 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6038005 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6038006 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6038007 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6038008 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6038009 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6038010 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6038011 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6038012 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6038013 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6038014 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6038015 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6038016 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6038017 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6038018 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6038019 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6038020 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6038021 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6038022 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6038023 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6038024 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6038025 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6038026 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6038027 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6038028 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6038029 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6038030 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6038031 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6038032 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6038033 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6038034 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6038035 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6038036 this is a planning took where all things are going
6038037 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6038038 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6038039 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6038040 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6038041 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6038042 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6038043 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6038044 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6038045 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6038046 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6038047 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6038048 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6038049 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6038050 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6038051 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6038052 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6038053 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6038054 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6038055 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6038056 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6038057 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6038058 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6038059 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6038060 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6038061 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6038062 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6038063 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6038064 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6038065 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6038066 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6038067 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6038068 initially he wanted to go it alone with just his band and road crew but now he wants nancy to be with him all the way
6038069 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6038070 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6038071 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6038072 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6038073 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6038074 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6038075 i found the stunt a lot more exhausting and physical than i expected it to be
6038076 i was wearing three weight belts to keep me on the seabed and i had to keep equalising yet try and look graceful being underwater was emotionally really liberating though
6038077 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it
6038078 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
6038079 i ended up returning her call she was very happy
6038080 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6038081 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6038082 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6038083 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6038084 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6038085 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6038086 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6038087 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6038088 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6038089 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6038090 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6038091 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6038092 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6038093 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
6038094 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6038095 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6038096 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6038097 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6038098 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6038099 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6038100 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6038101 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6038102 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6038103 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6038104 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6038105 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6038106 kita memang dekat dari dulu suka ngobrol nggak ngomongin soal kerjaan aja soal yang lain juga
6038107 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6038108 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6038109 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6038110 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6038111 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6038112 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6038113 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6038114 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6038115 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6038116 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6038117 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6038118 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6038119 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6038120 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6038121 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6038122 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6038123 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6038124 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6038125 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6038126 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6038127 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6038128 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6038129 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6038130 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6038131 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6038132 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6038133 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6038134 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6038135 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6038136 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6038137 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6038138 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6038139 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6038140 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6038141 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6038142 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6038143 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6038144 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6038145 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6038146 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6038147 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6038148 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6038149 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6038150 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6038151 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6038152 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6038153 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6038154 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6038155 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6038156 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6038157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6038158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6038159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6038160 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not even negotiate it is impossible to advance any conversation
6038161 the ioc does not comment or provide information on any doping cases until a decision is made by either the disciplinary commission or executive board
6038162 im not happy she competed again we have rules in our country that we abide by we dont bring anybody who cheated previously so why should any other country
6038163 id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6038164 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6038165 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6038166 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6038167 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6038180 o presidente da rep blica decidiu devolver hoje assembleia da rep blica o decreto n 232 x que aprova o regime jur dico do div rcio solicitando que o mesmo seja objecto de nova aprecia o com fundamento na desprotec o do c njuge que se encontre em situa o mais fraca geralmente a mulher bem como dos filhos menores a que na pr tica pode conduzir o diploma conforme explica na mensagem enviada aos deputados
6038181 importa n o abstrair por completo da realidade da vida matrimonial no portugal contempor neo onde subsistem m ltiplas situa es em que um dos c njuges se encontra numa posi o mais d bil n o devendo a lei por ac o ou por omiss o agravar essa fragilidade
6038182 para n o agravar a desprotec o da parte mais fraca o legislador devia ponderar em que medida n o seria prefer vel manter se o regime do div rcio culposo
6038183 ainda poss vel afirmar com algum grau de certeza que o desaparecimento da culpa como causa de div rcio n o far diminuir a litigiosidade conjugal e p s conjugal existindo boas raz es para crer que se ir processar exactamente o inverso
6038184 na verdade no m nimo singular que um c njuge que viole sistematicamente os deveres conjugais previstos na lei possa de forma unilateral e sem mais obter o div rcio e sobretudo possa retirar da vantagens aos mais diversos n veis incluindo patrimonial
6038185 por exemplo numa situa o de viol ncia dom stica em que o marido agride a mulher ao longo dos anos uma realidade que n o rara em portugal poss vel aquele obter o div rcio independentemente da vontade da v tima de maus tratos
6038186 mais ainda o marido apesar de ter praticado reiteradamente actos de viol ncia conjugal pode exigir do outro o pagamento de montantes financeiros
6038187 estimulado a manter uma conta corrente das suas contribui es para os encargos da vida conjugal e familiar

6038192 our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again
6038193 if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
6038194 the new rates would bankrupt us along with every other webcaster in currently in operation
6038195 if you increase your rates and if it puts those rate paying stations out of business then youre going to get nothing these rates essentially dont rely on the understanding of the economics of web radio
6038196 artists and copyright owners deserve to be fairly compensated for the blood and sweat that forms the core product of these businesses
6038197 tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the business
6038198 if soundexchange has a shot at 75 or even 300 of revenues theyre motivated to go for it even if its in the long run against their own interests

6038201 so the attempt to stretch the computer fraud and abuse act has failed please read the statute for yourself and ask yourself do you want talking about computers and security to become a crime punishable by fines and imprisonment and subject to fbi and secret service oversight
6038202 at first glance the issues at play may appear obscure and of interest only to technical researchers and lawyers
6038203 but the right to publish without pre publication review is part of the purpose of the 1st amendment and one of the reasons americans fought the revolutionary war
6038204 the mit students were behaving as good citizens within this culture of security research they met with the mbta before the presentation they never planned to expose the full details of their successful expose of the vulnerability of the mbtas fare system the free speech implications are even more important because showing faults with a government agencys systems is core political speech the boston herald reports that an mbta advisory council member was concerned with the fare card payment systems in light of this controversy and noted that the t gave a no bid contract for charliecard services to a former government employee this makes the public interest in this matter even stronger

6038211 tass the government news agency said that the decision illustrated ronald reagans cannibalistic instincts and was an extremely dangerous step toward the further spiraling of the arms race and enhancing the threat of nuclear war
6038212 they are squealing like theyre sitting on a sharp nail
6038213 simply because we now are showing the will that we are not going to let them get to the point of dominance where they can someday issue to the free world an ultimatum of surrender or die
6038214 in sommige gevallen moest de inspectie zelf ingrijpen omdat er te grote risicos waren blijkbaar doen sommige politiediensten amper moeite om diefstal door eigen personeel of door buitenstaanders te voorkomen en ook controle is er nauwelijks veel politiezones hebben ook onvoldoende infrastructuur om de in beslag genomen spullen veilig te bewaren de algemene inspectie wil nu duidelijke richtlijnen
6038215 and its getting to the point where we see it as griefing especially when one refuses to remove it
6038216 strays are normally only taken to kennels the second time they are picked up or on any subsequent occasion
6038217 however well be taking a tougher stance in the hope of highlighting how seriously we take the problem of owners allowing their pets out unaccompanied
6038218 during the past two years we have picked up almost 1 000 strays
6038219 these animals are a problem because they foul in public places can be responsible for unwanted litters and can also pose a danger to the public
6038220 i hurt my ankle in the warm up but since this is the olympics i did not want to pull out i tried my best but i was unable to do anything

6038223 i kissed anna nicole she came to my rocker chick show she was wearing one of those dotted net see through things with roses on her bullet bra underneath it was when she was doing dietary supplement trimspa and she looked really beautiful
6038224 russell admires hicks and is very keen to be involved in the project
6038225 comedy has never been seen as russells strong point so this is an opportunity to change the publics perception of him
6038226 like hicks russell is very passionate and forthright with his views and isnt afraid to upset people if he thinks hes in the right this could be an ideal role for him
6038227 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6038228 when youre a cleaner and you walk into a trashed room its truly annoying
6038229 all you want to do is go on your tea break and you get faced with that
6038230 spare a thought for the poor schmuck cleaning the room
6038231 during the time we have spent in the make up chair we talked about everything but the photo shoot global issues babies human rights
6038232 paul starr has this uncanny ability to look at a face and see what it needs hes done my face a thousand times and never repeated a look i have never felt more like the best version of myself than when paul has made me up
6038233 its fatal when actresses use botox i remember seeing cold mountain and it really looked to me like nicole kidman had been using it
6038234 her face was neither sad nor glad nor anything she was just like a painted doll
6038235 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death
6038236 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6038237 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6038238 we have carried out an analysis of what doherty does his band speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
6038239 then the crowd starts fighting we became concerned because the moonfest organiser did not appear to have due cognisance of all the risks
6038240 with pete and babyshambles being our headlining act for the weekend this draconian action taken by the police make it impossible to run the event at the end of august to say we are surprised and devastated would be an understatement
6038241 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6038242 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6038243 nowhere in the country is the sector kept out of the purview of the strike
6038244 its news to me it wouldnt surprise me if they wanted him but they would have plenty of hoops to jump through
6038245 p arents are being undermined by the junk food culture that is increasingly promoted to our kids on tv on the internet and even in their schools
6038246 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
6038247 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
6038248 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
6038249 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
6038250 epidemic is having an expensive impact on local public services
6038251 investigate promptly thoroughly and impartially all cases in which egyptian border guards or other security forces have opened fire on people seeking to cross egypts borders with israel or other countries
6038252 bring to justice those responsible for killings or for excessive use of force and provide reparations to those whose rights have been abused
6038253 the egyptian government is entitled to regulate the entry and stay of foreign nationals in egypt but in doing so they must respect everyones right to life
6038254 there is nothing to indicate that those seeking to leave egypt and cross into israel have used force or posed any threat to the egyptian border guards who fired at them
6038255 cease all forcible returns of people to all countries where they face human rights violations in line with egypts obligations under international human rights and refugee law
6038256 the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6038257 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of zanu pfs unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6038258 the security agencies are ruling out the possibility that any terrorist act or deliberate act was behind the incident
6038259 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil

6038318 it will be exported mainly to europe but also to other markets in the world
6038319 while europe is important we need not be confined to it suzuki operations in south asia south east asia the middle east and africa can also gain from the experience and expertise of maruti suzuki

6038321 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a strong disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of issues

6038331 i believe that the reasonable responsible thing for the governor of this state to do is not make any decision before you bring in a team of engineers and scientists and you have someone tell you if the technology is there to do offshore drilling off the coast of north carolina
6038332 i think that can revitalize and especially bring new jobs to the eastern part of the state
6038333 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
6038334 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
6038335 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
6038336 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies

6038347 its important for us as fast as possible to establish some sort of a longer term idp solution
6038348 one of the challenges is to determine how many are permanently displaced and how many will go home as soon as the russians leave and how many are somewhere in between

6038373 nabi saw melakukan shalat pada bulan ramadhan dua puluh rakaat dan witir
6038374 rasulullah saw melakukan shalat pada bulan ramadhan sebanyak delapan rakaat dan witir
6038375 sesungguhnya nabi saw tidak menambah di dalam bulan ramadhan dan tidak pula mengurangkannya dari 11 rakaat
6038376 jika seseorang melakukan sholat tarawih sebagaimana mazhab abu hanifah dan ahmad yaitu 20 rakaat atau sebagaimana mazhab malik yaitu 36 rakaat atau 13 rakaat atau 11 rakaat maka itu yang terbaik
6038377 sholat tarawih 11 rakaat atau 13 rakaat melakukan salam pada setiap 2 rakaat dan 1 rakaat witir adalah afdal meniru cara nabi saw dan siapa pula yang sholatnya 20 rakaat atau lebih maka juga tidak salah

6038379 the scam involves a person or persons entering a businesses and stealing the businesss debit pin pad and replacing it with a dummy pin pad that records the users card and pin number information they can then return and switch the pin pads again taking the dummy pin pad and its collected information they then use this information to make new debit cards to access your account make purchases and steal your money
6038380 some of these bogus pads are blue tooth enabled which allows the suspects to transmit the information to someone who might be sitting in a car in the parking lot with a laptop
6038381 if they have wireless technology they will transmit it immediately to someone who is fraudulently creating cards
6038382 this is an excellent way to ensure that the environment is protected and to ensure that this effluent is handled properly
6038383 in the end the project came in 10 lower than expected
6038384 the upgrade did not cost taxpayers as costs were covered by existing user fees
6038385 there is no intention to re tender so the prices are the prices as determined by the end of this week
6038386 if i have any increase in staff i dont even know where ill put them we cant store anything so there has to be an answer of some sort
6038387 prior to my arrival they agonized how that response would happen and they designed a building to meet the needs of the detachment they came up with this plan which has been somewhat modified over time
6038388 since inception this project has been in the hands of the regional district even before the district of westside was incorporated it doesnt appear to me the district of westside has been in control of this situation from the beginning
6038389 it is starting to unravel prices have gone up and the building size has gone down
6038390 certainly the regional district is handling this project at the pleasure of the westside and if the westside chose to take over management of this project the regional district would understand that decision to do so
6038391 council has indicated to us a go ahead from a financing point of view
6038392 fall construction is the anticipated date for the west harbour development that will be the first mega sized project that will go ahead
6038393 overall the project will have about 1500 doors its one of the largest projects between calgary and vancouver
6038394 i believe the towers are somewhat back from the lake things like shadows wind circulation around the towers its all part of the permit application and is all being considered
6038395 i think the future is calling for more increased density housing as long as its done right architecturally from what weve seen theres a lot of open space and protection of the lake and the environment so all of those things are being considered
6038396 the driver of the bus was deceased before police arrived on scene he was a caucasian male in his early to mid 60s and is believed to be from the lower mainland
6038397 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6038398 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6038399 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6038400 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6038401 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
6038402 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
6038403 these include the wetland inventory mapping project sensitive habitat inventory mapping project and the sensitive eco system inventory project
6038404 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
6038405 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
6038406 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
6038407 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
6038408 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
6038409 i continue to support these initiatives of council but to walk proudly in the city of kelowna i cannot defend the approach taken by council today monday i am willing to deal with any of the consequences as a result of this decision and can only apologize to the citizens for not being able to bring forward a different decision than was reached monday
6038410 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
6038411 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
6038412 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
6038413 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
6038414 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
6038415 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
6038416 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law
6038417 the city will ask the appeal court to rule on whether a charitable trust can be established when land is not gifted the city purchased the land in 1946
6038418 city council is committed to preserving public ownership and public access to the waterfront land and the city hall site
6038419 the polyphenolics in pomegranate can play an important role in the modulation of inflammatory cell signaling in colon cancer cells
6038420 we expected and intended to have no impact whatsoever on the direction of prices
6038421 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
6038422 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
6038423 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
6038424 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
6038425 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people
6038426 the new design signals a more upscale direction for one of vancouvers most established brands

6038437 however the u s army remains fully committed to protecting the health and safety of those living and working both on fort meade and in the surrounding communities
6038438 groundwater pollution at the fort meade site has been a problem for many years
6038439 the army was ordered to clean up this site and has failed to complete their mission we cannot stand by any longer while this pollution threatens marylands citizens and environment
6038440 it took the board of selectmen almost two weeks to come up with a draft letter to explain what happened with the sweetland case
6038441 its slow because it takes time to meet and react
6038442 if north attleboro had a mayor maybe a letter would have been drafted the day after the verdict because a mayor wouldnt have to wait until a meeting to discuss it
6038443 our government is based on volunteers we have fantastic people who put their heart and soul into it but when that happens things can turn into turf wars
6038444 we need to take away the anxiety and stop the bickering it strangles the community
6038445 all im saying is that a mayor form of government seems to be better managed and able to handle things a lot faster and a lot quicker
6038446 were in a computer age but were operating like were way back in a covered wagon era
6038447 i know that people say that we should go to a town manager but look at mansfield things dont seem much better there

6038450 before the olympics i asked a gymnastics federation guy about jasons chances for a medal
6038451 he said jason has the ability but the mens competition would be phenomenal it would be tough for jason and that he needs to stick to his routine because he has had consistency problems
6038452 in the last few months he has really pulled things together during his performance he was digging perfect holes in the middle of the trampoline
6038453 i just love that part just watching the scores pop up and see if theyre higher or lower thats one of my favourite things
6038454 thats a lot of flips and twists that skill was harder than anything else that was done
6038455 my strategys always been lets take the lead if youre good at one thing why not push the envelope a little past the other guys and make them look bad rather than a sort of conservative strategic routine and see what happens

6038457 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
6038458 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me was not fit
6038459 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
6038460 i have a squad and all the players are important tomorrow i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers
6038461 what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality

6038463 in the short of space weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that
6038464 also if she was either breathing excessively rapidly or slowly which new and or frightened divers are prone to do elevated co2 could have been the cause although in such cases anxiety panic is typical prior to loss of consciousness she needs to make sure she breathes a continuous and unbroken pattern of slow deep inhalation and exhalation

6038466 the fact that she quickly recovers post dive without treatment makes me suspect not a medical condition

6038474 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
6038475 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
6038476 ive learned from talking about i want to win the euros and things like that
6038477 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
6038478 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
6038479 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

6038524 we are here because we must find a way to re engage these students for one reason or another we are not successful
6038525 were about just moving on and getting the work done with these young people
6038526 we expect to serve everybody here like the nordstroms of student services
6038527 so any young person that walks in that door will be welcomed with a smile and treated like the adults that they are
6038528 this is not a place where were going to give you a phone number and say go make the call yourself
6038529 this is necessary because not all youth are determined to get out there and search and find the education that is needed
6038530 this re engagement center is a wonderful idea it lets students know that there is a better way instead of dropping out of school and feeling lost
6038531 theres a lot of kids out there who feel as though theres no place for them theres no hope and that the school district has failed them and they have failed themselves

6038541 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6038542 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6038543 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
6038544 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
6038545 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there

6038645 all credit to the farmers and businesses in angus because they have agreed with us and the standard of accommodation now for our international and migrant workers is getting better by the day
6038646 at the end of the day if youre looking after a worker youll get a better return from it and the farmers that weve spoken to so far are delighted with the response from the migrant workers

6038668 the time span was two years and the offences took place whilst you were a valued and trusted employee of charlie miller

6038682 the grangepans post office is at the heart of the local community
6038683 it is important that the elderly disabled young families and carers many of whom cannot readily travel to boness town centre are able to access their own local post office in grangepans i urge local residents to register their opposition to this proposed closure by completing our survey and writing directly to the post office
6038684 the local postmaster is opposed to the closure and has welcomed our campaign in a small number of cases the decision has been revoked and the post office has remained open as a result of the public consultation the post office can be influenced by people showing that closure would cause hardship or if they have overlooked prospects for local business
6038685 grangepans post office provides a vital service to the local community it is terrible that this facility is under threat i hope local people will oppose any attempt to close this service

6038816 producers appreciate things get heated on occasion but they never anticipated things would kick off quite as much
6038817 it was quite eye opening to say the least for fellow judge cheryl cole who had never seen a confrontation quite like that on the show before
6038818 it has to do with the incredible amount of enthusiasm for obama in the democratic base here in utah which is not as insignificant as you might think
6038819 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now

6038829 the experience in speaker idol competition at teched sea 2008 was great it reminds me of those debating competitions that i participated when i was in high school presentation skills are something that will go a long way in your career most people have no problems giving presentation but not many can see how well they are presenting speaker idol is a good testing ground for this with the 10 minutes time limit it requires you to focus on giving the most captivate presentation that is within the attention spans of most audiences most people tend to be long winded and afraid to miss out every single detail in the presentation this risks losing the audience attention before the core message is presented some of the tips that i would like to share are 1 make your presentation simple and logical presentation with smooth flow of thoughts is more important than thoroughness and details as you dont really know which details are interesting or boring to the audience specific details can be addressed during the questions and answers session keep reinforcing the core message throughout the presentation 2 break your audience guessing machine in order to capture your audience attention you must present something that seems obvious to them but then end up something unexpected there is a caveat in this the key is you must establish the obviousness beforehand or otherwise the audience will get confused and irritated before you show them the unexpected outcome 3 speak in a concrete manner we are so used to these jargons and knowledge and take granted for it without realizing what is like for those people without try to give concrete examples during presentation that relate to your message if you can find a powerful metaphor thats even better 4 touch the emotion of your audience this is not an easy feat but if you can bring out the emotion of your audience you had given an impactful presentation the easiest way is telling some real world stories that are related to your presentation technet edge more about thomas microsoft innovation center cyberjaya that specializes in r amp d and commercialization of software that manages and visualizes information over the complete building lifecycle in the construction industry as a young company we have a diverse responsibilities range from software development and project management to product and marketing strategy planning as well as involving in the commercialization process i enjoy my job very much developing great software has been my hobby since i was little and i have great passion of doing it to me i often say software technologies is the representation of knowledge economy as it is the key driver that transforms intangible knowledge of various domains into tangible and practical applications that lever up business capabilities we should be proud as programmers of these contributions to many industries on the other hand working in objective world is fun as a small but dynamic company it provides me plenty of opportunities to gain exposure from the technical and commercial side of software business to harness my capabilities further

6038835 o presidente da rep blica decidiu devolver hoje assembleia da rep blica o decreto n 232 x que aprova o regime jur dico do div rcio solicitando que o mesmo seja objecto de nova aprecia o com fundamento na desprotec o do c njuge que se encontre em situa o mais fraca geralmente a mulher bem como dos filhos menores a que na pr tica pode conduzir o diploma conforme explica na mensagem enviada aos deputados

6038837 para n o agravar a desprotec o da parte mais fraca o legislador devia ponderar em que medida n o seria prefer vel manter se o regime do div rcio culposo
6038838 ainda poss vel afirmar com algum grau de certeza que o desaparecimento da culpa como causa de div rcio n o far diminuir a litigiosidade conjugal e p s conjugal existindo boas raz es para crer que se ir processar exactamente o inverso
6038839 na verdade no m nimo singular que um c njuge que viole sistematicamente os deveres conjugais previstos na lei possa de forma unilateral e sem mais obter o div rcio e sobretudo possa retirar da vantagens aos mais diversos n veis incluindo patrimonial

6038851 la miner a ha acompa ado al departamento chilecito desde tiempos ancestrales hay registros a partir de la poca incaica que ponen de manifiesto que poseemos una gran riqueza mineral en toda nuestra provincia
6038852 a pesar de esta tradici n minera algunas personas en nuestros d as intentan asociar a la miner a con la extracci n indiscriminada de recursos naturales y la contaminaci n del medio ambiente
6038853 esto responde a que en el pasado esta actividad se realizaba sin una previsi n adecuada que considerara los aspectos ambientales incluidos los impactos sociales y econ micos
6038854 en la primera mitad de los 90 se establecieron est ndares mundiales de cumplimiento obligatorio los proyectos s lo se aprueban si se demuestra que podr n tener un buen control de los impactos ambientales
6038855 la imagen de la miner a moderna carga con ese pasivo que a n le cuesta desprenderse sin embargo pocos conocen el impacto positivo y la verdadera transformaci n que conlleva una actividad minera moderna y responsable
6038856 en el contexto pol tico se habla de una nueva miner a que representa el concepto de una industria minera moderna pujante y responsable social y ambientalmente que hoy emergen en distintos pa ses del mundo y en distintas provincias de nuestro pa s generando progreso al mismo tiempo que resguarda los recursos patrimoniales como el agua el aire la flora la fauna el legado antropol gico o las tierras agr colas
6038857 en s ntesis la miner a lo mismo que toda industria humana ha ido evolucionando e incorporando tecnolog a que permite el resguardo del medio ambiente y por consiguiente respeta la vida por ello la actividad representa una de las claves productivas para abandonar la marginalidad y la pobreza

6038863 i thought the first 60 minutes were a bit scrappy there was a lot of ball down a lot of penalties given away but in the last 20 minutes i thought the players did what we asked them to do in training and we came good with 20 plus points i am pretty happy overall with the performance we knew they had a big tough pack and they gave it us a bit but i thought our forwards stood up to it and when we started to play it a bit smarter and get it out to the edges the points came we trained well last week and another of our aims was to kick on for the play offs we wanted a tough game you dont want to be going into the play offs on the back of a 70 point win

6038889 unfortunately this is something we are seeing more and more of it has been a problem in the north east but it seems to be moving over here we are working with police to find those responsible on top of the disruption people who are carrying out these thefts are risking their lives by messing with the cables the fault was repaired by engineers but there were knock on delays for some of the services
6038890 i am flabbergasted at the incompetence of this labour government our young people have been completely let down and ed balls should take full responsibility our local education authority is in complete chaos as a result and the fact that all the marking has to be double checked will cost taxpayers dear

6038954 its a huge huge difference being an olympian means more than a commonwealth gold medalist to americans my sponsor reebok had a bit of a hard time at the us olympic trials and only had four athletes qualify to go to the games to represent the us
6038955 then at the games they havent had the greatest successes swedens carolina kluft one of their marquee athletes decided to pull out of the heptathlon as defending champion
6038956 for me to come through and pull out a medal in one of the key key events for them has just been huge the guy who signs my cheques todd klein said he received at least 50 emails from boston back where headquarters is so everyones very very happy that will pay off my mortgage that one basically so im very happy
6038957 obviously a lot of it is hinged on this olympic year i guess financially its a huge relief to do well and it will certainly help with the mortgage in auckland
6038958 im very happy its better than your average nine to five job in new zealand
6038959 you look at the rowers for example theyre very talented athletes and get by with next to nothing relying on sparc funding whereas i can earn some good prizemoney and ive got some very loyal sponsors who support me i really cant complain
6038960 nothing is signed or sealed yet but its looking promising it will be back in the big league
6038961 beatrice has indicated she wants to go home earlier if she does choose to go its at her cost
6038962 certainly her plan is to go home early but she hasnt confirmed anything yet
6038963 people support you and you go out and support your mates
6038964 if beatrice has gone youd have to say youre disappointed with her but once somebodys gone shes gone
6038965 the key right now is the team providing support for each other
6038966 regardless of whether you guys write me off or whatever you did that last year and not only insulted or disappointed myself but my family
6038967 i eked out that last inch to dip him on the line that would have been absolutely devastating to come that close then just miss out i thought i had it with 60 to go then with 20 to go i saw him coming he screamed in despair when he realised he didnt get it
6038968 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
6038969 that you start to believe it yourself i truly did believe it on the start line that it was there for the taking
6038970 this is just absolutely huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
6038971 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
6038972 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
6038973 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium
6038974 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

6038976 it was john walker peter snell and jack lovelock all rolled into this 1 83m 69kg streak of athletic talent

6038989 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia
6038990 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything
6038991 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
6038992 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland

6038995 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6038996 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardising russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests

6039004 he poses a danger to a peaceful and orderly society and offends thai morals
6039005 he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
6039006 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6039007 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6039008 poland did very well to come back and played very well defensively bt we did well not to lose concentration

6039010 i cant say that we managed to fully cope with the bulgarians especially kaziyski
6039011 in the first set we were just waking up but after that we managed to play collectively
6039012 as for bulgaria they can play one very good game in any tournament and i was praying before the game that it wouldnt be against us
6039013 as the premier league is televised live im afraid that we will be sticking to our dates and insisting that the four competing players on the thursday night duly honour their contracts
6039014 i am very disappointed and i cant understand why world snooker hasnt discussed dates with us
6039015 our dates for the premier league were set in april of this year following consultation with world snooker venues were booked and the seven competing players were contracted in may
6039016 its a shame that world snooker made no effort to avoid conflicting schedules and will subsequently be losing four top players from their event
6039017 i dont imagine that the players concerned will be too happy either
6039018 there has been an adverse finding in her a sample against her blonska

6039024 we have considerable reservations as do our players and the australian cricketers association
6039025 the icc understands the considerable reservations that we new zealand england south africa and perhaps some others hold
6039026 were hoping that the icc will give us some advice some sort of certainty within the next 24 hours about what the next step in this process is
6039027 hopefully that will allow greater clarity about whats going on and we can all get on with making the decisions that we need to make
6039028 we will not put them in a situation if we get specialist advice that tells us that its not safe to do that
6039029 the security advice does not give us any great encouragement at the moment

6039033 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6039034 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6039035 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
6039036 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
6039037 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community

6039150 to those who werent in moscow in the moments that followed the implosion of the soviet empire its difficult to convey the depth of humiliation that russians felt
6039151 but it isnt because of the communist era or stalinist paranoia that russians think theyre being surrounded by the west or dismissed by western capitals or both im taking care here not to fall into the rather simplistic argument that russias stance on the separatist provinces and georgia itself is a justified reaction by moscow to the way the west has treated it and the way the united states went to war in the middle east or the way that the major western countries have recognized the independence of kosovo from serbia a former client of moscow after all to explain a behavior in this case of the russians is not to support it

6039160 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
6039161 u s rep zack space ohio kept up a busy recess schedule tuesday by hosting the first of three town hall meetings throughout the 18th congressional district
6039162 space brought along rep collin peterson chairman of the house committee on agriculture to give an update on the latest legislative information on agriculture and the farm bill at the ohio university zanesville zane state college campus center
6039163 peterson also noted other details of the farm bill including an emphasis on conservation programs alternative energy and broadband development to help farmers and more funding for rural development
6039164 he also mentioned a push to eliminate small farms those with 10 acres or less from participating in usda programs to help with a backlog of paperwork
6039165 if you are not a real farmer a weekend farmer i dont think we should give you any money peterson explained he cited the example of a farmer who has 20 acres of land but only has riding horses
6039166 taking the small farms off the rolls of those receiving government assistance could cull 260 000 farms from programs and cut down on the bureaucracy created to handle them
6039167 from his perspective as chairman of the house ag committee implementation of the 2008 farm bill has gone pretty well except for one policy that just happens to be a provision collin peterson himself initiated and thats the 10 acre rule which eliminated payments for producers with 10 or fewer acres
6039168 our intent was to aggregate so that anyone that had an aggregation of less than 10 acres of base would be eliminated peterson said from what i understand they have now agreed to relent and do it the way we intended
6039169 but chairman peterson also told brownfield hes keeping a close eye on whats going on over at usda
6039170 given my experience trying to work with them and the fact that they vetoed it and opposed us obviously im watching them very closely said peterson
6039171 senator chuck grassley of iowa says congress may need to take further action on the 10 acre rule in the farm bill
6039172 grassley and 23 other senators last week sent a letter to schafer asking him to recognize congress intention
6039173 with a stroke of its pen congress restricted eligibility for direct payments for small farms those with fewer than ten acres the reason was to make the program more efficient and save money the committee chairmen said usda set to work to write new rules to comply with the new law and
6039174 in its draft rules usda attempted to avoid end runs by limiting producers opportunity to consolidate to avoid the cut off
6039175 the ten acre flap likely will be sorted out quickly on the basis of what the law really says however the application of extremely complex programs to farming operations that differ widely in their resources and scale and even in their economic objectives will always be a severe challenge and as program rules become increasingly complex the challenge to do so equitably will become even greater washington insider believes
6039176 in a phone call with farm reporters this morning sen
6039177 the tariff however is going to be higher than the blenders credit which will drop to 45 cents a gallon in january
6039178 brazil has complained about the tariff and threatened wto action
6039179 if the u s is producing 9 billion gallons of ethanol the cbi allows 630 million gallons duty free importers are taking in only about 70 percent of the potential under the cbi grassley said that suggests there is still potential to import nearly 200 million gallons more ethanol duty free as u s production increases so do those duty free levels as well

6039181 that eighteen wheeled evidence of prosperity shows why the plains states are a bright spot in the otherwise gloomy national economic picture here the housing market is holding up just fine the banks are making plenty of loans and employers keep adding jobs
6039182 the good times in farm country show the difficulty facing policymakers grappling with the nations economic distress underscored yesterday by data indicating the steepest rise in monthly wholesale prices in 27 years and a 17 year low for new housing construction
6039183 the numbers are gloomiest for sun belt states with eviscerated housing markets and there interest rate cuts and stimulus checks are helping ease the pain but in the area stretching from the oilfields of texas north to the dakotas where the economy is holding up fairly well those government actions may prove unnecessary and even contribute to new bubbles
6039184 the price of farmland in nebraska has doubled in the past three years primarily reflecting the boom in commodity prices the increase also reflects the impact of rate cuts by the federal reserve that enabled buyers to bid up land with borrowed money
6039185 corn has risen to nearly 6 a bushel from around 2 in 2005 earlier this summer it was as high as 7 50 for an average sized nebraska farm with an average yield that means an extra 900 000 in revenue though that has been offset significantly by higher costs for fertilizer and fuel
6039186 the strong sales environment is helping trigger new long term investment wal mart has scaled back on its expansion plans nationally but it is in negotiations to build a new store in blair blair nebraska which is about 35 miles northwest of omaha several other retailers are opening nearby
6039187 this isnt blairs first retail boom the 70s those were some good years said realph jim realph who worked in the farm credit system in the 1980s and is now mayor of blair who is also a farmer real estate broker and seller of crop insurance everybody was making money

6039279 public knowledge of jurors names is a well established part of american judicial tradition
6039280 the purposes served by the openness of trials are also served by public access to the jurors names
6039281 prospect of criminal justice being routinely meted out by unknown persons
6039282 does not comport with democratic values of accountability and openness
6039283 with the conclusion that the public has no right to know who ultimately
6039284 such reporting may require significant and unwarranted invasions of the privacy of the jurors
6039285 none of whom had a choice about being called to service
6039286 requiring district courts to bow to media demands to know the names of prospective jurors would certainly impair the public good in many cases
6039287 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public
6039288 although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process

6039295 im sick and tired of getting the same old thing
6039296 i said no more of the same old stuff be creative we had one heck of a fight but i got my point across
6039297 they just look and think hes not interesting cut him out you can almost see the scissors
6039298 they both had quite small roles in a big film phil cate and consequently me got snaffled over to rome for 10 weeks in the height of summer it was fabulous cate and phil were only working two days a week and we just got on
6039299 its something ive been thinking about for years how can you have any kind of longevity in a career in the arts everyone has a moment when theyre at their best but that cant be it
6039300 in painting circles there are often a lot of couples where they are both painters but the wife has given up her art to support her husbands career i found that really interesting
6039301 but ive never lived like that and ive never had that level of success
6039302 having looked through the prism of cate and what ive been exposed to through being married to cate for 11 years you can see across to the people whom that sort of stuff happens to i dont know those sorts of people that end of that world
6039303 im never followed but cate is her public identity is very associated with her work which i think is good right and proper because shes bloody good at it when her work is coming into focus people want to see a photo of her carrying shopping bags i can understand it people are interested and im glad theyre interested otherwise they wouldnt come to see it
6039304 an oscar for acting is not a suitable recommendation to run the biggest theatre company in the country

6039328 im only 21 and i know that i still have a lot to learn
6039329 liverpool want riera but are reluctant to meet espanyols demands
6039330 i honestly think i faced a lot more dangerous a chris eubank than the eubank who fought dan sherry or ray close
6039331 why because eubank wasnt motivated eubank was dangerous when he fought watson and dangerous when he fought benn
6039332 when he was the underdog when his back was against the wall he was a different animal
6039333 when i fought him that time people talk about him having problems making super middleweight but ive lost 14 pounds in a week to make the weight
6039334 weve all done that he was a dangerous fighter he gave me one hell of a fight but people didnt give me the credit they gave him the credit for coming back
6039335 that was my first 12 round fight id done eight rounds twice and knocked everyone else out inside three so on that aspect i dont think much would have been different if id fought eubank at his peak
6039336 dont forget im a lot better fighter now when i fought eubank
6039337 if i fought benn obviously he was a dangerous puncher but i think hed have had a nightmare with my style
6039338 it would have been a difficult fight but id have beat him id have beat them all
6039339 hed probably have been the most awkward of all of them
6039340 at the end of the day when push came to shove he lost and thats the difference between a great champion to have your back against the wall and find a way to win
6039341 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players
6039342 there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6039343 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6039344 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6039345 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6039346 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6039347 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6039348 keane is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6039349 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6039350 its bad news for holland that they went out but it means we get a player back
6039351 hopefully he can be here either today or tomorrow to train with the rest of his team mates
6039352 he has been playing important games so i dont think there will be any problems with his fitness but our doctor and fitness coaches will check with him and then we will see about the weekend i am sure he will be okay if he trains normally then he can be available for middlesbrough
6039353 a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians

6039355 if the cat got sick i could not afford to take it to the vet
6039356 the cat was very sweet i could see myself easily becoming attached to it

6039382 our 50cc scooters are unchanged but for a some new colors
6039383 all manufacturers are caught wondering what to do to keep up with demand
6039384 scooters just dont change much certain style things change and there has been significant engine design improvements but there isnt much change unless its a whole new model
6039385 the water polo took place at the yingdong natatorium which cries out to be modified once the games are over into a global forum for nonsense verse

6039393 although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is clear it is important to emphasise that each of these assets are driven by multiple varying factors put differently there is more to oil than the u s dollar and vice versa
6039394 very little correlation between oil prices and the u s dollar over the longer term
6039395 but pp youre linguistically talented and its royally unfair of you to insist that we language barbarians must learn latin
6039396 de meesten onder hen 1492 om precies te zijn kwamen om bij de initi le agressie van georgische troepen
6039397 vanaf het moment dat de libanese regering hezbollah legitimeert moet ze begrijpen dat de hele libanese staat een doelwit vormt net zoals isra l een doelwit vormt voor hezbollah
6039398 deze k2 was veel minder sterk dan men mocht verwachten elk positief gegeven heb ik ten onrechte uitvergroot daar waar ik toch perfect wist dat elk resultaat recht evenredig staat met hetgeen men op en naast het water presteert dat geldt vooral wanneer men al niet over de fysieke mogelijkheden beschikt van zijn tegenstanders het kan best dat mijn atleten op het eind van deze halve finale een inschattingsfout maakten maar het falen stak hem eerder in de race vooral dan op het moment dat ze hun leidersplaats uit handen gaven
6039399 zo professioneel sporten zon carri re en nu zon afgang ik zal er alles aan doen om hem te overtuigen op zijn minst nog n jaartje door te gaan we maakten wellicht de verkeerde keuze en het zou niet fair zijn dat bob zijn succesrijke sportieve loopbaan op zon dieptepunt afrondt hij is nu bij een mental coach want de mentale averij die hij hierbij opliep valt niet in te schatten ik zal hem dan ook enkele dagen met rust laten en ondertussen werken aan een plan dat hem kan overhalen om er minstens nog n jaartje bij te doen het wordt niet makkelijk want voor de enorme inspanningen die hij al vele jaren levert en de spartaanse leefwijze die hij daarbij volgt kreeg hij vandaag uitzonderlijk weinig terug
6039400 ive been called personally 17 times and asked how and when i would like to die

6039403 neo advertising plans to immediately begin utilizing rvue rms addressable advertising technology in their existing canadian locations as well as future outlets located in europe and north america
6039404 to maintain our highest standards of quality and roi through our growth we only choose partners who have already achieved success and respect in the competitive out of home market
6039405 rms networks and their rvue technology is a perfect fit for this objective
6039406 neo advertising has grown into one of europe and canadas largest and most well respected providers of digital signage the industry is poised for record adoption over the next few years and neo is in an ideal position to capitalize on the wave
6039407 rms is proud to work with neo as they continue their impressive growth
6039408 the mystery behind paris hiltons big boobs has been solved and no it doesnt involve plastic surgery
6039409 georgia allowed itself to be provoked but the russian response has been disproportionate bombing all over georgia is unacceptable and reminiscent of things we hoped belonged to the past
6039410 its a coincidence wed been planning this negotiation session way before the georgian crisis the realities of the polish media are that once we made a deal its impossible to keep a secret so we announced it georgia made a dramatic backdrop to it but the timing had nothing to do with georgia
6039411 for technical reasons the interceptors cannot affect russian missiles on this side of the urals and we have offered russia the right to inspect at any time and even industrial monitoring of this site so she could be reassured that there are no modifications to the base and it only has the capabilities we say it does which is to say nothing to do with russia
6039412 well we hope it doesnt come to that but we are a member of nato and the american facility increases nato security from ballistic missiles and we hope that this time our allies help us to even out the risks
6039413 that is why accompanying the us missile deal we also have the introduction of us military assets on the ground in poland there are two us guarantees one to manage the missile site and one to maintain to provide for the deployment of a us patriot battery
6039414 the british didnt come though in 1939 you declared war but you didnt go to war

6039418 je nai pas de doute il faut tre l moi aussi j tais sous le choc mais je vous dis en conscience que si c tait refaire je le referais
6039419 les envoyer en afghanistan avec 1 an dexp rience c tait les envoyer au casse pipe
6039420 mais que voulez vous on sait quil est mort apr s pour le reste y a rien de plus savoir
6039421 il tait fier de partir l bas mais il avait seulement 1 an dexp rience 6 mois de formation et 6 mois dexercice en caserne ce nest pas assez c tait les envoyer au casse pipe

6039425 yeah i get a little each month but not enough to live on
6039426 ive got a big problem doctor every time were in bed and my husband climaxes he lets out this ear splitting yell
6039427 thats completely natural i dont see what the problem is
6039428 how come you never tell me when you have an orgasm
6039429 when you die im getting you a headstone that reads here lies my wife cold as ever
6039430 when you die im getting you a headstone that reads here lies my husband stiff at last
6039431 by selectively focusing on high density areas we are committed to achieve 25 per cent coverage of the population in sabah this year
6039432 customers in east malaysia can expect to pay up to 40 per cent less for redtones wimax compared to traditional leased lines
6039433 its a 79m challenge we have the best possible springboard and momentum from beijing and i am absolutely confident that we will realise this goal
6039434 to say we are not going to have a private fund raising scheme
6039435 but we are planning for the full funding commitment the commitment to funding of athletes will be met it would be ridiculous to create any uncertainty
6039436 three times russian president dmitry medvedev has said they are starting the withdrawal and they have not
6039437 we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law
6039438 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
6039439 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
6039440 i was hoping it the executions would be before the fasting month but it cannot
6039441 i have nothing to cover up ill be open about this
6039442 the possibility is slim because the courts are the ones who have the authority to postpone it
6039443 all who are involved will get gods wrath and curse and will be put in hell forever
6039444 but i was wondering why those who kill over 200 people are afraid of facing the death penalty themselves
6039445 i think if we have a review of the status of the death penalty we have to review the overall system of punishment because we dont want to see for example someone who is involved in a serious murder be freed before the age of 50 or below 50 and continue to be a problem for the society
6039446 the possibility of the death penalty being abolished has to be balanced with a more adequate system of punishment
6039447 when they did that in california they had an 11 million litre tank that they partially drained every two hours
6039448 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
6039449 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process
6039450 would encourage russian sense of victimhood fuel russian revanchism and allow the russians to position themselves as the champion of reform for those currently outside
6039451 lets go inside crick this playing around is starting to annoy me

6039468 i m getting gray hair running for president will age you quick
6039469 it s been gradual it hasn t been all of a sudden it s the norm for his age group
6039470 i don t think he s trying to hide anything he s proud of the few gray hairs he does have when i was coming up we were told it was a sign of wisdom
6039471 it s an absolute benefit for him gray hair helps because it makes people look like they re older and in his case he needs it
6039472 it has nothing to do with stress it has nothing to with anything except your genetic milieu everybody is programmed to get it at some point in life
6039473 when it s real shorter you ll probably see a little bit more grey when it s longer you can t really tell that much
6039474 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
6039475 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
6039476 americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health or the health of their families
6039477 ye didnae come to a complete stop at the stop sign

6039487 liverpool want riera but are reluctant to meet espanyols demands
6039488 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players
6039489 there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6039490 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6039491 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6039492 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6039493 i spent seven years at liverpool and played more than 250 games the challenge in italy was the right one for my career and the time was right to change to another country
6039494 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6039495 keane is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6039496 i knew he was a liverpool fan from his childhood and this is the best move of all those he has had in his career he could be the reason liverpool will challenge for a title
6039497 its bad news for holland that they went out but it means we get a player back
6039498 hopefully he can be here either today or tomorrow to train with the rest of his team mates
6039499 he has been playing important games so i dont think there will be any problems with his fitness but our doctor and fitness coaches will check with him and then we will see about the weekend i am sure he will be okay if he trains normally then he can be available for middlesbrough
6039500 i honestly think i faced a lot more dangerous a chris eubank than the eubank who fought dan sherry or ray close
6039501 why because eubank wasnt motivated eubank was dangerous when he fought watson and dangerous when he fought benn
6039502 when he was the underdog when his back was against the wall he was a different animal
6039503 when i fought him that time people talk about him having problems making super middleweight but ive lost 14 pounds in a week to make the weight
6039504 weve all done that he was a dangerous fighter he gave me one hell of a fight but people didnt give me the credit they gave him the credit for coming back
6039505 that was my first 12 round fight id done eight rounds twice and knocked everyone else out inside three so on that aspect i dont think much would have been different if id fought eubank at his peak
6039506 dont forget im a lot better fighter now when i fought eubank
6039507 if i fought benn obviously he was a dangerous puncher but i think hed have had a nightmare with my style
6039508 it would have been a difficult fight but id have beat him id have beat them all
6039509 hed probably have been the most awkward of all of them
6039510 at the end of the day when push came to shove he lost and thats the difference between a great champion to have your back against the wall and find a way to win

6039513 it often goes unrecognized that torture is not something of the past but is in fact very much a part of our world today it is carried out in more than 100 countries and is a tool used to break a human being down it is the cruelest and yet most effective instrument of power in our world
6039514 i urge those countries who have not yet signed up to the uncat to do so and i call on all ratifying countries to do as they preach to implement the convention effectively in their national legislation and to follow it
6039515 the torture victim is the loneliest person in the world furthermore torture never solves problems but instead creates hatred for these reasons i am extremely passionate about my fight against it and trying to help those who have suffered pain at the hands of torture is simply the most rewarding work i can do
6039516 dr genefke has worked tirelessly to campaign against the use of torture and to help those who have fallen victim to both the mental and physical pain it can cause it is because of her work that we are able to not only understand the true effect that torture has on people but also that it remains widespread throughout the world today this year iasp is delighted to honour dr genefke with the special prize for lecturers at the 12th world congress on pain and we wish her the very best of luck with her deserving nobel peace prize nomination

6039518 management of severe pain with strong opioids is unfortunately associated with a number of side effects the most prevalent side effect is development of constipation constipation may lead to discomfort and ineffective analgesia
6039519 the new generation of prokinetic drugs with peripheral opioid antagonistic actions seems to offer our patients a more effective solution to opioid induced bowel problems than conventional laxative therapies
6039520 the new recommendation from the smc is to be welcomed new data supporting the role of versatis in post herpetic neuralgia will further establish that such a novel non systemic treatment approach offers significant benefits in the older patient group who suffer co morbidities and consequential polypharmacy
6039521 the smc is to be congratulated on its revised decision for versatis theyve taken a huge step forward in extending options for pain relief for people living with neuropathic pain this decision will alleviate a lot of suffering

6039526 we discussed the details of how lebanon could cooperate with iraq in the oil sector and on oil investment including lebanese investment in iraqi oil fields
6039527 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6039528 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that
6039529 we are very pleased to have louis join our board

6039539 our second quarter results in the midst of the real estate market downturn demonstrate unique value
6039540 due to a combination of tight monetary policy and the earthquake in sichuan province real estate transaction volumes in most major cities were down substantially compared to the same period last year our ability to generate growth in transaction volume and value in this market condition further demonstrates our increasing market share and stronger leadership position at the same time our real estate consulting and information service revenue continued its strong growth which helped to deliver impressive performance in our revenues and profits
6039541 looking ahead to the third quarter of 2008 we expect conditions within chinas real estate market to remain challenging compared to the second quarter real estate transaction volumes for july and august in most leading cities will likely show bigger year on year decline this is because july and august of 2007 saw unusually strong transaction activities at the peak of the real estate market boom the 2008 beijing olympic games may have also caused a temporary slowdown in real estate transactions however we are seeing that many developers have adjusted their sales strategy in preparation for the peak season that traditionally begins in september by placing a sharp focus on increasing sales volumes and cash flows this trend combined with our continued belief that the long term fundamental demand for real estate in china remains strong provides compelling reasons for transaction volumes to rebound starting in september
6039542 during the second quarter we achieved strong revenue growth and stable profit margins despite difficult market conditions for the third quarter we expect to continue solid growth in revenue as a result of a larger number of projects sold by us and strong growth in our consulting and information service segment our asset light service oriented business model insulates us from the cash flow problems that many developers face during periods of slow transaction volume moreover a challenging market presents an ideal opportunity for us to expand our market presence and secure additional projects to support future growth
6039543 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies
6039544 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
6039545 li li i will help you solve your problem but you must listen to me and obey what i tell you
6039546 yes mr huang i will do whatever you tell me to do
6039547 you cant use a quick acting poison to get rid of your mother in law because that would cause people to become suspicious therefore i have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body
6039548 dont argue with her obey her every wish and treat her like a queen
6039549 dear mr huang please help me to keep the poison from killing my mother in law shes changed into such a nice woman and i love her like my own mother i do not want her to die because of the poison i gave her
6039550 li li theres nothing to worry about i never gave you any poison the herbs i gave you were vitamins to improve her health the only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her
6039551 the person who loves others will also be loved in return
6039552 this festival is a natural expression and celebration of our community creative spirit
6039553 artists were always the main aspect of the festival and dance and music were always on the bill
6039554 its fun i love being in contact with all of these wonderful performers
6039555 its a celebration of the creative spirit inclusive of people from all walks of life in our region
6039556 on one level it is about the circle of life
6039557 these are like the tibetan peace flags the wind carries the wishes
6039558 when we started environmental row four years ago ub green came onboard and from there we really blossomed in terms of our mission of environmentalism which has been one of the festivals objectives from the start
6039559 weve accomplished a lot of the goals that we set out to accomplish but there is much more to grow from this event
6039560 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6039561 risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6039562 here we are at gatwick airport it has suffered investment wise because baa has focused more on heathrow airport
6039563 there are problems here which go beyond the monopoly which are to do with regulation the way investment is managed the capacity at airports runway capacity and so forth and also more broadly just the absence of any kind of grand plan since baa was privatized more than two decades ago
6039564 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6039565 yesterday they said they had no problem with parliament opening and today they have a problem i have no comment on that
6039566 its caught the heart of australians and at the moment the public is really really desperately wanting something to save the whale

6039571 i have what some may call a na ve belief that kenya is a haven of untapped potential
6039572 look around at kenyans making it in the diaspora i am a firm believer that restrictions of the mind result in restrictions in performance i am hoping that my belief that a compelling idea can come from kenya will fuel the right developer to see beyond themselves as a kenyan developer and more as a developer who the world is demanding a service from
6039573 i think the cool thing about blackberry it is more open one can develop using multiple languages on multiple platforms

6039575 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
6039576 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
6039577 theres no doubt that if it reaches a critical mass the riaa will intervene
6039578 for the past several months we have communicated our legal concerns with the site and repeatedly tried to work with them to have illegal content taken down muxtape was hosting copies of copyrighted sound recordings without authorization from the copyright owners making these recordings available for streaming playback also requires authorization from the copyright owners muxtape has not obtained authorization from our member companies to host or stream copies of their sound recordings

6039583 despite the attention that stem cell research has received most of the work has been restricted to biological approaches
6039584 for those discoveries to go from the test tube into treatments that heal injuries and cure diseases we will need to equip a broad range of scientists and engineers with stem cell knowledge and expertise
6039585 the techniques allow hackers to quickly colonise thousands of legitimate sites from big brand sites like wal mart to smaller but equally legitimate sites
6039586 over the last year malware authors have moved away from attacks in which they directly interact with victims via social engineering for example to indirect attacks accomplished through compromised websites
6039587 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court
6039588 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better

6039590 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6039591 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6039592 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6039593 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6039594 massage is helpful in the short term but the alexander technique retained effectiveness at one year the results should apply to most patients with chronic or recurrent back pain
6039595 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6039596 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6039597 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6039598 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6039599 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6039600 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6039601 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6039602 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease

6039608 the stakes for wilmington clinton county this region and our entire state are very high
6039609 the wilmington air park is a priceless asset right here quietly nestled in this community is the largest privately owned airport in the united states
6039610 this is not a republican issue or a democrat issue
6039611 this is about the people of this community and how we can work together to deal with this situation and save jobs
6039612 this is not just a company moving out but its a ripping out of the community
6039613 we saw this day coming when we heard the news from dhl on may 28
6039614 working with dhl we have been able to offer many of our employees a fair and meaningful severance package
6039615 it could be one of your relatives or the lady that sits next to you in church im sure if you go anywhere and ask for a show of hands that someone there would say theyve received blood
6039616 the need is real important and not just in trauma situations it could be for your grandfather after having open heart surgery
6039617 they say youre saving three lives by giving and thats something to be proud of
6039618 we couldnt do this without all the volunteers who work we need the churches and granges to run it
6039619 i enjoy the people you meet a lot of really nice people
6039620 i talked my grandson into donating blood when he was going to river view and he has ever since
6039621 we would like to get our numbers way up especially with the young
6039622 as some older givers stop because of age or disease we need the younger generations to pick up where they leave off
6039623 recently we had a major trauma where the patient needed a negative blood and we just had some come in from testing he was very fortunate

6039628 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6039629 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
6039630 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6039631 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6039632 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6039633 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6039634 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6039635 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6039636 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6039637 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6039638 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6039639 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade

6039649 i like it a lot i needed a small backpack for my locker and thats what i got
6039650 when you have limited funds to provide for school its always nice to find ways to make nice for them
6039651 as ive been going door to door and traveling the district people have been telling me that increased gas prices are hurting them

6039676 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6039677 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
6039678 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
6039679 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6039680 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6039681 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6039682 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6039683 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6039684 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6039685 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6039686 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6039687 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6039688 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6039689 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6039690 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6039691 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6039692 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6039693 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6039694 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6039695 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6039696 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6039697 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6039698 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6039699 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6039700 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6039701 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6039702 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6039703 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6039704 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6039705 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6039706 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6039707 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6039708 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6039709 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6039710 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6039711 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6039712 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6039713 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6039714 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6039715 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6039716 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
6039717 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
6039718 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
6039719 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
6039720 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
6039721 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
6039722 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
6039723 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6039724 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6039725 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6039726 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6039727 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6039728 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6039729 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6039730 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6039731 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6039732 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6039733 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6039734 the values of humanity that rogge had predicted and he respectfully submits that since he depus own prison is a mere 10km away from the olympic hurly burly rogge could easily enough test these claims if he wished
6039735 it very much reflects the very relaxed and happy position the ioc is in in terms of how it views the success of these games
6039736 une demi finale des jeux olympiques ce nest pas un match comme les autres quand on y va une fois on ne sait jamais si on y reviendra on a dabord se comporter de mani re pr cise pour faire le boulot comme il doit tre fait ensuite il faut que la dimension de l v nement soit un booster et pas un boulet
6039737 information and communications are strategic assets and information and communications technology is a significant driving force for the development of our region and future
6039738 the krg in line with global trends is working towards making it a core part of its institutions through an it master plan we made a strategic choice to partner with pwc to accomplish this goal this is happening at a time when our region is taking serious steps towards modernisation
6039739 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6039740 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6039741 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6039742 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6039743 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6039744 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6039745 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6039746 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6039747 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6039748 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6039749 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6039750 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6039751 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6039752 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6039753 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6039754 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6039755 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6039756 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6039757 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6039758 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6039759 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6039760 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6039761 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6039762 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6039763 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6039764 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6039765 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6039766 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6039767 its hard you wanna see him be a part of it more but you know the powers that be are going to make it such a big deal theyll be like obama was with dude who was smoking weed i would love to see obama go on
6039768 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6039769 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6039770 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6039771 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6039772 having a young person like obama run for president has inspired many in the hip hop community
6039773 but hes running for president so hes not going to endorse any one genre of music or any one aspect of a cultural phenomenon like hip hop because hes going to be the president of
6039774 i feel negativity is not to be paid attention to
6039775 unless its something that happened with chris when it gets that serious its time to speak out
6039776 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6039777 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6039778 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6039779 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6039780 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6039781 hes a great producer and hes really at the top of his game right now
6039782 i cant ask for a better person to guide me we did ice box it wasnt enough for us to really build a solid relationship but ive got to spend time with him and we have a strong relationship its the biggest blessing that has happened to me musically
6039783 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6039784 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that
6039785 im gonna be 24 this year its a progressive age 21
6039786 i was finding myself and finding out the things that needed to be done as far as my career what needed to be done certain moves i feel like now im in a really great place cutting my hair i feel like im going to another level cutting my hair was a step for me anybody that has had hair for so long when youre used to something its like reforming your life
6039787 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6039788 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6039789 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6039790 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6039791 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6039792 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6039793 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6039794 who are open to doing something on the production side
6039795 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6039796 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6039797 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6039798 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6039799 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6039800 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6039801 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6039802 enough time has passed that our economic model is obsolete
6039803 we can no longer integrate their titles into our global distribution for the holiday
6039804 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6039805 fibre to the cabinet fttc is certainly capable of delivering faster speeds than copper based adsl just by the nature of optical transmission
6039806 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6039807 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6039808 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6039809 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6039810 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6039811 its a movie that would definitely lend itself to seeing further adventures
6039812 lets do death race 2 i had a terrific time working with this group of people pauls terrific if they want to make another one then im in
6039813 we did the movie that is the beginning of roger cormans original death race 2000 the genesis of the death race that is portrayed in that 1975 film
6039814 if you watch this movie you can imagine how that would develop into what roger portrayed
6039815 but there are aspects to the first movie that we havent really addressed in this movie
6039816 for example in the first movie you run people down for points in this movie certainly lots of people get run down you just dont score points if we did do another movie i would like to address that if this develops into a franchise it would be slowly building towards what rogers movie was it feels like that movie actually takes place about 20 years after the events of this movie
6039817 i think me and jason is gonna get along for a certain period but were gonna end up having another conflict in the sequel
6039818 i look forward to fight scenes with jason cause i dont think nobody is really gonna believe he can whoop my ass
6039819 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6039820 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6039821 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6039822 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6039823 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6039824 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6039825 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6039826 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6039827 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6039828 our resource center is packed each day with job seekers and folks working toward their g e d
6039829 i dont want to go out of town and look for work that i might not get
6039830 not with gas prices the way they are and i have a 13 year old son i dont want to uproot him from school and relocate
6039831 for whatever reason the survey showed there are about that many people not actively seeking employment
6039832 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6039833 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6039834 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6039835 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6039836 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6039837 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6039838 misleading to the consumer in terms of what may or may not be the properties contained within that product
6039839 the lighting on bellflower represents a huge collaboration between asi campus administration campus police and the city of long beach
6039840 it has been a long fight but a fight well won for students
6039841 anytime we can help the city with environmental friendly issues and experiments we will
6039842 whats wrong with you why didnt you ask me if i wanted rice
6039843 theres nothing wrong with me what is wrong with you
6039844 today was just a culmination of hitting the ball well and making some good defensive plays
6039845 i knew what i needed to do today to clinch
6039846 so i went out there and did it and it feels great
6039847 the way we lost left kind of a sour taste in our mouths
6039848 it starts on the mound and youve got to get it stopped on the mound
6039849 he told me that was my last guy i told him to get off my mound
6039850 i just had to keep a positive mindset and just throw
6039851 398 chipped stone tools and fragments 66 ground or polished stone tools and fragments 744 fragments of non human bone 640 shell beads and 28 pieces of ceramics or fired clay
6039852 its been a long process but we are working cooperatively with native americans to return all of the artifacts
6039853 i am a huge celtics fan and of course i want the celtics any team except the lakers
6039854 it is good for the nba as far as generating more money and attracting a larger fan base
6039855 they the lakers will take it in game 7 i think it is a much better rivalry because of the history of it with magic and larry bird going at it in the 80s
6039856 it will be a good accomplishment for phil because he deserves it
6039857 ive gotten a lot of time especially in the off season to think about the things that have happened
6039858 but its still pretty crazy to think back that just three years ago i was at long beach and before that i wasnt even thinking about professional ball
6039859 i thought he could hit the first time i saw him
6039860 he had really quick hands for a hitter and his bat speed was as good as weve ever had here
6039861 hes since made himself a real good defensive player too but the first thing that caught my eye was his offense
6039862 it was just exciting to be back in california and to be able to play in this park but to have the day i had was a great feeling
6039863 we all told him he was going to hit a home run
6039864 you could tell he just felt good being at home so we had that feeling he was going to do something good
6039865 last night after his first home run we all just sat down
6039866 we never got up to congratulate him usually you kind of do that to the new guys and it was fun for him everybody got a laugh out of it it might have helped him he hit another one in the ninth inning
6039867 a lot of the people who were watching on tv the old college coach i probably had about 10 messages left after the game
6039868 it was crazy thats the only word that can really describe it
6039869 i got called up right before the game in durham so i was on a plane that night and i was pretty nervous to be honest with you then once i got on the field and got my first at bat out of the way it all came back to me
6039870 everybody comes back its just kind of tradition i see guys who i didnt see all year back there in the fall working out
6039871 i think it just shows how much they got out of the program
6039872 that they are willing to give back and i think our players look at that and understand what a close knit group this long beach state baseball family is
6039873 a bit cooler than i ever was at that age
6039874 one of the challenges in studying big fish like sharks is the entire ocean could be their neighborhood
6039875 im probably one of the more skeptical in the research group
6039876 i dont think well ever be able to figure it out as to why sharks attack people
6039877 the environment is changing so quickly and some of that environmental change is caused by us
6039878 we wont be able to tell whether the things we are seeing are normal or whether those have been induced by things that we have done to the environment
6039879 go to the beach but know what youre getting into
6039880 we have one more step before we are officially approved
6039881 we had to demonstrate a need for the program that we were filling a niche and that it was different from other programs
6039882 we think we can train people to get good jobs
6039883 there are lots and lots of jobs in that area
6039884 its for people who want to go out there and organize in a community
6039885 mitzi loved the idea of using a rain barrel but theyre so ugly no one wants to use it
6039886 thats actually how this started why cant someone create a rain barrel thats pretty
6039887 its just the queen of rain barrels it has the womans aesthetic and the functionality of a rain barrel
6039888 summer games is a great community event that not only showcases our talented athletes but provides a fun environment for families to enjoy sports competition games and live entertainment with no cost for admission
6039889 my favorite thing about swimming is the freestyle and backstroke
6039890 i always tell susan you can do anything you want to do
6039891 she is positive shes upbeat and she is willing to try to do anything
6039892 my mom put me in the water when i was two years old and ive been swimming ever since
6039893 its about setting my goals its not so much the competition against other people its beating my own personal time
6039894 i swim for my stepmom who has pancreatic cancer she is my inspiration
6039895 i like to play basketball and i like my team
6039896 my favorite thing to see is the interaction between the players its definitely one of a kind
6039897 in no other sport will you see athletics helping other athletes even on the other team to succeed
6039898 i have been volunteering for 40 years at the special olympics
6039899 we send medical supplies and medical equipment when people are suffering we are there to cover it
6039900 we only had about two weeks to rehearse but we are very grateful to be here and we really appreciate your support for
6039901 she got involved in one of our local programs in the student government there
6039902 its called weve got your back when the disaster happened she saw in the paper that we were willing to help with she called me and said i really want to connect you with some folks who are willing to help with they came up with what they wanted to do for the fundraiser
6039903 since the troupe and i knew each other we knew what we were expecting from the dancers
6039904 en el mes de diciembre pasado hemos reclamado un urgente incremento tarifario atentos a que la situaci n de incrementos en los costos especialmente salariales ven an deteriorando la situaci n econ mica general del sistema
6039905 el incremento que se dispuso fue muy inferior al solicitado
6039906 tiene que ver con los aumentos de los insumos cuesti n que es de p blico conocimiento y adem s no est n llegando un parte importante de los subsidios
6039907 para dar un ejemplo este mes deber an haber llegado subsidios de 4 000 pesos por unidad y llegaron solo 3 000 pesos por unidad y si pensamos que en septiembre tenemos que afrontar incrementos salariales los subsidios deber an llegar a 5 500 pesos por unidad
6039908 tanto argentina como grecia son dos grandes equipos grecia es una selecci n que tiene jugadores de muy buen nivel europeo y nosotros tambi n somos buenos
6039909 creo que va a ser un partido tensionado donde hay que estar super concentrados todo el tiempo porque es para lo que una se prepara durante tantos a os
6039910 es medio contradictorio cruzarse con holanda en una semifinal pero para ganar la medalla de oro hay que ganarles a todas y nosotras tenemos ese objetivo
6039911 creo que ma ana se va a poder ver un partido sumamente divertido se va a ver un gran hockey se viene una semifinal como la de atenas 2004 que espero que tenga otro resultado
6039912 no empezamos jugando como quer amos nos golpeamos bastante contra el piso con los empates ante estados unidos y gran breta a pero recapacitamos bastante y nos dimos cuenta que se nos pod an escapar los juegos ol mpicos de las manos
6039913 i was getting so teary eyed even before it started
6039914 it was so cool to see one of my professors elizabeth philipose as the mc
6039915 the smaller graduation is more meaningful for me i was with the people i grew up with people who know me it was something very special in a different way
6039916 we feel the need to celebrate and value our culture at the same time
6039917 it encompasses the latino culture and also has a bilingual ceremony which is beneficial for family members
6039918 if a group of any background of students formed a committee and wanted to have their own graduation they could apply to asi for help with funding
6039919 come and talk to the treasurer or any officer in asi about organizing the graduation and get help with funding thats how the lavender graduation started
6039920 a lot of the reasons groups have their own cultural graduations is because they already had a large organization on campus like pac
6039921 if there is a group of japanese students that would want to organize a cultural graduation that would be fun
6039922 i would be interested in a japanese cultural celebration if they had one because i have several friends that would participate in it
6039923 were looking for a girl who is civically aware and cares about this city
6039924 most of the time theyre cleaning the beach or volunteering at a homeless shelter
6039925 its a quote by gandhi to find yourself you must lose yourself in the service of others
6039926 the feedback from the community is critically important to us
6039927 the type of guy you want in a foxhole with you
6039928 hes got the right mental framework and he knows how to pitch
6039929 i like to get on the mound and get going
6039930 i dont want to walk around and think too much
6039931 i try and throw nine innings every time i go out there
6039932 he showed he can keep his velocity up he can pitch at 89 91 miles per hour and he can do it in the first inning and he can do it in the seventh or eighth
6039933 andrews command of all his pitches is way above average
6039934 liebel as a senior draftee is tricky but his stock is rising the draft is a funny thing
6039935 all it takes is one guy that likes you and you can go really high even the 2nd or 3rd round
6039936 we are planning on getting to work the day after we take over the campus
6039937 when you look at a campus of our size we dont have adequate housing and we certainly do what we can to fill the on campus housing
6039938 thats not to suggest that were setting aside our plans to extend our on campus housing
6039939 its a good option until we can expand the number of beds we have on campus and we do have plans to do that
6039940 this more immediately helps us provide more residential opportunities and choices for students
6039941 as the company realigns its focus we determined that it was no longer in the best position to support brooks college in order to enable long term future growth
6039942 we havent been taking in new students for a while now
6039943 weve worked very hard to make sure that our students complete their courses
6039944 there are so few brooks students left that this really is not a big issue
6039945 the purchase of the brooks campus was primarily made to increase housing opportunities for csulb students in an environment that would support their academic progress at the university
6039946 student fees or housing costs would not be impacted by this purchase
6039947 specific determination of programs or classes to be offered has not yet been made
6039948 i do films for myself out of true love and necessity this is why i never know if i ll be able to do another film i might lose the urge one day
6039949 a tool to redevelop our downtown but there are other tools as well
6039950 when you do a small area development plan like the downtown master plan is it is not going to identify and address every issue
6039951 it addresses as many of their needs as it possibly could
6039952 but when there is significant public input that went into this plan and now there is significant public disillusion and despair and pessimism and people are saying
6039953 why were we so committed im concerned how we avoid this failure in the future
6039954 silence will help you in every aspect of your lives if you will simply sit down and make room for it
6039955 if you pursue the work of silence even for six months your life will change dramatically and if you persist you will find the joy that no one and nothing can take from you no matter what happens
