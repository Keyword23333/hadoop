6600051 to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go to gene and what he stood for
6600052 with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with help from the presidents at the time be it troy and trace armstrong
6600053 its been no secret that this has been troys ambition for a while
6600054 gene made some strong statements about not planning to leave im sure a number of people will want the position but i think troy will be high on the list of qualified people
6600055 troy is the kind of guy who can make things happen
6600056 he was a very competent president and a very involved president he took the job extremely seriously and handled the position as well as anyone has my initial gut reaction is that troy has a pretty good chance of getting the job
6600057 we tried different things we kept trying to say that itll be fine you dont have to be afraid but that wasnt enough
6600058 they dont have to be a primary victim of the flood
6600059 the fact that they were there and in that county will qualify them for services
6600060 its not everyday that we have a natural disaster so you may feel like this is strange this is weird its not sometimes asking for help if the hardest step but its the first step that they take in recovery
6600061 theres still a little fear there i would have to say things have gotten better were still working on our game plan
6600062 the blackberry bold continues rims tradition of targeting the corporate user but at a high end price point with a three year commitment uptake may not be great even in enterprises let alone the consumer market
6600063 and rim is late to the party with its blackberry bold considering apples iphone has been available for over a month
6600064 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6600065 his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6600066 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6600067 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6600068 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6600069 a lot of hits he took were because a lot of people couldnt believe this black former football player was accomplishing what he was accomplishing
6600070 and we all know what a deal the last deal was and thats why the owners got out of it i dont think he ever got the credit he shouldve gotten for that because of the lack of acrimony between him and tagliabue and the last two years
6600071 the further you get away from how they led up to the deal and you look back and you realize what the union came away with i think that becomes the legacy the one big piece that i think was still in the process was this idea of the broader issue of retired players how you take care of them with injuries and the like it is kind of a sad additional piece to think about that he too becomes someone who dies young football players die young it keeps happening
6600072 he has meant a tremendous amount to the players union and was pivotal in creating the stature and footing they have today
6600073 we have knocked heads recently over issues relating to the treatment of former nfl players and the execution of the current disability system i disagreed with gene with regard the fact that there are major flaws in the disability program and on the nflpas treatment of retired players the problem still exists and needs to be addressed but today is not the time to talk about those issues or the future it is a time to extend condolences to his family
6600074 woah that guy looks like donghae gege i loveeeeeeee him so much man
6600075 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6600076 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6600077 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6600078 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6600079 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6600080 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6600081 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6600082 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6600083 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6600084 i have done my job and it seems nobody is understanding my point about the cartoons that i aimed at terrorists who spread fear not islam
6600085 in denmark you can mock and criticise everything and anybody including the queens even the holocaust the holocaust is something that happened but it did not provoke me i did the caricature because the terrorists who use your holy prophet mohammad as a hostage provoked me
6600086 i came to the conclusion that i will not come to amman even if i officially receive the subpoena
6600087 i have tried to explain myself but nobody understood me even i talked to the organisers of the campaign and it does not seem that they understand my point and why i did the caricature they do not understand that my problem is with terrorists not muslims
6600088 by his caricature he gave the impression that islam is a faith of violence and terrorism all muslims were insulted by the drawings
6600089 the state of despair and anxiety the cartoonist is going through reflects his lack of seriousness
6600090 i am not a hero i am just a cartoonist who has done his job as he was supposed to
6600091 yes i will do it because it is my job disagreement is very important and if we disagree it does not mean that we have to sue each other and kill each other
6600092 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6600093 its extremely bittersweet im thrilled that it passed and i hope and believe that my daughter had something to do with it
6600094 it makes her passing stand for something and that gives us some solace
6600095 massachusetts has been a leader in expanding health insurance for all of its citizens and now we are focused on meeting the needs of every child
6600096 there are too many children in the commonwealth who go undiagnosed or untreated for mental illness

6600106 each site has different requirements regarding where your blog is hosted and how long it has been up
6600107 it is very early days but i would say one or two days out of the box the reaction is excellent but we have to see
6600108 this market is so unsteady now we need to let it play out for a few days and see if we can use it to build some momentum
6600109 thats the reason we brought it out to see if we could find anything that would get the market going a little bit
6600110 its a sign of the times that were trying to stimulate the market
6600111 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6600112 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6600113 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6600114 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6600115 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6600116 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6600117 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6600118 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6600119 even scottie is making fun of tony blair in the other thread because he supported america bush and the war on terror and he is a born again christian scottie has to say
6600120 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6600121 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6600122 i find it ironic that in order to out hip apple microsoft is hiring a comedian whose prime was a decade ago they may as well have phil collins do the background music while theyre at it
6600123 i think seinfeld was credible in the american express ads he used to do but microsoft needs him to be twice as good at comedy and many more times effective at drawing the audience into the message of the commercials if they want to best apple
6600124 gates is certainly a very recognizable figure but hes never been someone i viewed in the position of a humorous or edgy pitchman for microsoft
6600125 whenever ive seen him speak about microsoft and its products it has always been a much more logical intellectual presentation and im wondering how that fits in this new series
6600126 if the entertainment value of their ads isnt exceptional theyll look like a cornered cat lashing aimlessly in desperation
6600127 dont quite have an understanding of how to overcome the advantage mccain has with independents
6600128 obama needs to figure out how to advertise on a mass basis that goes beyond shots of him giving inspiring speeches and talking about change its pretty easy when youve got a charismatic candidate like barack obama to just sit there and go whoa this guys great lets do 30 seconds of him talking and thats really all theyve done
6600129 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different
6600130 all the momentum was on obamas side and they figured out a way to use that momentum to basically flip him
6600131 voters respond to them based on their own emotions and values whether its a candidate or a car there are certain attributes that drive voter decisions the goal is to make sure consumers understand that the candidate can be trusted that you can identify with the candidate that he or she shares your values
6600132 identification is a pretty significant driver for voters across the board republican and democrat
6600133 she did it by rolling up her sleeves doing events in pickup trucks riding in st patricks day parades
6600134 to protect this brand and continually reinforce its relevance to voters
6600135 youre experienced and have been around a long time thats the good news
6600136 the bad news is youre also seen as old flip it around and youre young and you bring new ideas and new energy at the same time you can be seen as inexperienced not ready for prime time
6600137 you cant change who you are but if you do have a perceived negative you link yourself to another brand which is another politician
6600138 i threw it in the dirt and it bounced far enough away to let burriss score the problem with that inning was the walk you give them a free ride and he gets the opportunity to use that speed to his advantage
6600139 those guys are trying their best to push us under the rug

6600188 aku bertanya rasulullah tentang bulan syaaban kerana aku tidak pernah lihat baginda banyak berpuasa sunat sebagaimana beliau berpuasa dalam bulan syaaban
6600189 bulan yang banyak manusia lalai dan padanya ialah bulan di antara rejab dan ramadan pada bulan syaaban akan diangkatkan catatan amalan hamba kepada allah swt dengan itu aku amatlah suka supaya diangkatkan amalanku ketika aku berpuasa
6600190 aku tidak pernah melihat rasulullah berpuasa dua bulan berturut turut kecuali bulan syaaban dan ramadan
6600191 allah swt memandang kepada makhluk nya pada malam nisfu syaaban lalu diampuni dosa hamba nya kecuali dua golongan iaitu orang yang membunuh diri dan orang yang menyebarkan fitnah

6600198 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6600199 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6600200 when the debate about houses is with a guy whose wife makes so much money she refuses to discuss it who is on vacation on one of the houses he doesnt even remember he
6600201 ive admitted it was a mistake to buy that house from a democratic fundraiser but nothing really untoward happened and at least i remember i did it
6600202 despu s de elevar a dios muchas y reiteradas preces y de invocar la luz del esp ritu de la verdad para gloria de dios omnipotente que otorg a la virgen mar a su peculiar benevolencia para honor de su hijo rey inmortal de los siglos y vencedor del pecado y de la muerte para aumentar la gloria de la misma augusta madre y para gozo y alegr a de toda la iglesia con la autoridad de nuestro se or jesucristo de los bienaventurados ap stoles pedro y pablo y con la nuestra pronunciamos declaramos y definimos ser dogma divinamente revelado que la inmaculada madre de dios y siempre virgen mar a terminado el curso de su vida terrenal fue asunta en cuerpo y alma a la gloria del cielo

6600252 the diagnosis that keeps coming back is narcissistic personality disorder and attention deficit disorder
6600253 thats where you become so big on yourself that you put yourself above it all when you do that you lose touch with reality its a huge trigger mechanism for wood
6600254 and the first change we are going to make is to open up the process so that every voter can compare and contrast the candidates who purport to represent them for 16 years john doolittle denied voters that opportunity
6600255 this race is shaping up to be among the most closely watched in america this year
6600256 we are committed to partnering with community organizations and media outlets across the sacramento chico and reno markets to ensure every voter is able to access every debate
6600257 too often candidates skirt complex policy questions with empty partisan sound bytes
6600258 thats why so many of the problems we are facing in this election year arent new and its also why so many have gotten worse
6600259 the stakes are too high in this election for more politics as usual
6600260 thats why we want to give ample time to each policy area and why our first debate must cover the highest priority of the federal government our nations security

6600268 as an urban planner and environmentalist i support the well planned continuation of the 241 toll road easing traffic congestion will help the environment both physical and social
6600269 far greater damage will occur by not finishing the 241 to the environment air quality and quality of life
6600270 the 241 extension is a must have i used to surf trestles opponents arguments are meritless we need traffic relief now

6600312 we phoned the villagers after the dinner concert and they were ecstatic the word will spread across the village like a bushfire and the people will be thrilled
6600313 the donor wishes to remain anonymous but has asked the armidale community to get in behind the project to see it come to fruition
6600314 it will make an enormous difference to the lives of thousands of people now and in the years ahead as the villagers tackle the problems of achieving a sustainable community

6600329 skin cancer actually affects a lot of people in my family so it really made me excited to know that after what they had been through in their diagnosis of skin cancer there could be in the future a much easier and less painful way to get their diagnosis
6600330 what we found is that there are no differences associated with gender but there were differences associated with age so some compounds increased or decreased depending on the age of the subject
6600331 and what we saw was that in the patients that had skin cancer there was actually an increase in one of the compounds and a decrease in another and this was true when we compared each healthy subject with each skin cancer patient

6600431 y el que no se hall inscrito en el libro de la vida fue lanzado al lago de fuego

6600434 amanh vou sair com o meu pai e com a minha m e vamos ouvir uma confer ncia ora vejam
6600435 olha olha ele vai ouvir uma confer ncia que maravilha
6600436 sobretudo h que n o confundir os dromed rios com os camelos chamo a vossa aten o minha senhoras meus senhores e caros dromed rios para este facto o camelo tem duas bossas mas o dromed rio s tem uma
6600437 o que distingue os dois animais que o dromed rio tem s uma bossa ao passo que coisa estranha e que til conhecer o camelo tem duas

6600441 japan puts an end to the united states olympic softball dynasty
6600442 well thats clearly the best individual performance weve seen in the whole tournament it couldnt have come at a bigger time for the dutch
6600443 you know its been a great four years and to end it like this on such a high note to be a part of history with what michael did and to be able to share it with these two other guys as well you know it really means something and certainly something ill always remember it for the rest of my life it was one of those olympics that was most memorable for me
6600444 i think a lot of people dont look at swimming as a team sport and when you get out of a bad race and like i did in the 100 and get my world record broken right in front of my face it just goes to show you when you keep your chin up and feed off of your team and to come back in that medley relay and have a solid swim and eventually have a smile on my face and to end on a positive note like aaron was saying was really something special
6600445 that medley relay we knew australia was going to be putting up a good fight and you know a lot of people thought that was a for sure win for the u s because we have been so dominant in that in the past but over the last few years a lot of people are catching up to us and you know we were really motivated and this group of guys weve been on a lot of relays together and every time i get on a relay with them you know they always fire me up no matter what i knew it was going to be a tough challenge but they put me in a good position to finish it off
6600446 you dont stop a game for nothing it really can mess up any kind of rhythm i will say that brazil are the masters at this
6600447 the great thing about playing brazil is that you know youve played when you go off the field and into the locker room you really feel it
6600448 what they didnt have in the first game we are seeing in this last game
6600449 they are very dangerous they will always have fancy scoring chances
6600450 the difference between the good and the great players are those are the ones that can see the plays happening early and play at a pace that unnerves the other team it is like chess playing a few moves ahead
6600451 the give and take in this game has been amazing all the way through
6600452 heather oreilly is running like the game just started you talk about conditioning these women certainly have it and they will need it with 30 additional minutes to go
6600453 it is over they the u s successfully defend their title and it was not easy
6600454 this is an amazing story the way it started the way it ended it is not about how you start it is about how you finish the u s should be really proud of not only this game but how they persevered through this entire tournament
6600455 tears at one end joy at the other such an emotional game
6600456 it is an awesome feeling to be the winners of an olympic gold medal and it is so incredibly frustrating to be the winners of an olympic silver medal
6600457 this was a battle for the ages it will be watched and viewed over and over two great teams players of character playing their hearts out
6600458 this is not about money when you see them crying this is about playing for your country
6600459 they have tradition on their side when you put on the red white and blue something happens
6600460 she will do anything it takes she has been dreaming of this moment she doesnt care about a pitch count
6600461 team u s a has made a couple of critical errors today they have rolled through this tournament and sometimes when things are too easy they dont stress you or challenge you enough and you get in a pressured environment this type of thing can happen
6600462 a team that had been so dominant beaten today by japan
6600463 when you throw 28 innings in two days that shows stamina heart and amazing resiliency ueno deserves all the credit
6600464 japan puts an end to the united states olympic softball dynasty
6600465 obviously germany is coming into this tournament thinking we have an opportunity to win an olympic gold medal
6600466 its hard not to be happy to win a medal
6600467 twenty year old fatmire bajramaj the star of the second half for germany
6600468 one of the toughest womens players in the world no doubt about it certainly one of the most talented but also so tough
6600469 fowles has come in and we talked about her size shes just so strong too and once she gets a little bit more experience more maturity and understands the game shes going to dominate
6600470 theyve lost that confidence that they were playing with in the first half
6600471 give credit to the americans as far as making the russians change their attitude thats what makes the united states so strong they believe theyre going to win every game sometimes the russian teams you cant play poker all the time youve got to win every hand
6600472 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6600473 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6600474 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6600475 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6600476 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6600477 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6600478 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6600479 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6600480 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6600481 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6600482 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6600483 is that the lady that cooks where they give us the rice and the tea
6600484 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6600485 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6600486 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6600487 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6600488 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6600489 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6600490 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6600491 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6600492 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6600493 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6600494 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6600495 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6600496 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6600497 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6600498 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6600499 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6600500 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6600501 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6600502 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6600503 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6600504 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6600505 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6600506 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6600507 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6600508 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6600509 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6600510 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6600511 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6600512 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6600513 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6600514 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6600515 this is a planning took where all things are going
6600516 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6600517 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6600518 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6600519 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6600520 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6600521 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6600522 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6600523 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6600524 one of the best gator fan sites ive seen on the web
6600525 orange and blue hue for your viewing buck is simply a better gator blog than we can ever hope to be
6600526 o amp bh is was and will continue to be the best uf site on the interwebs
6600527 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6600528 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6600529 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6600530 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6600531 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6600532 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6600533 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6600534 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6600535 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6600536 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6600537 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6600538 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6600539 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6600540 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6600541 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6600542 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6600543 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6600544 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6600545 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6600546 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6600547 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6600548 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6600549 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6600550 despite the expected pullback in oil were as bullish as ever
6600551 crude oil futures recently hit a three month low after the energy department reported a surprise jump in oil stockpiles and weakening demand in the united states this led to a much overdue pullback in oil prices
6600552 no surprise ive been expecting a sell off one that should bring oil down to the 107 level before the next leg up begins however i remain as bullish as ever on oil
6600553 demand will bounce back growth in china and india continues and the dollar despite its recent rally remains in a long term bear market so once this pullback is over i expect oil to resume its bull market my 200 target stands firm
6600554 meanwhile enbridge inc canadas no 2 pipeline company recently reported its second quarter profits jumped 347 to 644 9 million the stellar performance was helped by the sale of assets in spain
6600555 the company plans to use some of those profits to expand its pipeline system to transport albertas oil sands crude to the u s and other markets
6600556 production from the oil sands deposits which are the worlds second largest oil reserves outside of saudi arabia are projected to jump to 2 77 million barrels a day by 2015 from 1 2 million last year
6600557 enbridge is at the forefront of this effort and stands to make some serious profits especially due to the proximity of those reserves to the united states the worlds thirstiest oil consumer
6600558 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6600559 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6600560 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6600561 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6600562 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6600563 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6600564 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6600565 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6600566 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6600567 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6600568 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6600569 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6600570 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6600571 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6600572 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6600573 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6600574 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6600575 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6600576 staff were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6600577 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6600578 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6600579 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6600580 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6600581 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6600582 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz
6600583 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6600584 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6600585 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6600586 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment
6600587 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6600588 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6600589 even if you have to sit together for a week
6600590 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6600591 mother baby and family are all happy and healthy he said in a statement associated press reported
6600592 its the same as you would do with a dog or cat in pain
6600593 he was listless was having trouble breathing was not really staying afloat the way a whale should
6600594 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6600595 yeah i heard it was on cnn breaking news they interrupted a debate on whether barack obama will choose deepak chopra as his running mate
6600596 of course not you idiot do you really think cnn cares how many medals india wins
6600597 well its pretty big news man its the first time india has won three medals at a single olympics its also the first time weve medaled in boxing weve meddled before but not medaled
6600598 im not sure what i mean to say is i thought indians were the nonviolent sort you know like gandhi
6600599 well ive never met an indian who was really into fighting have you ever been in a fight yourself have you ever hit anyone
6600600 no but i have hit my books really hard and ive also hit the dance floor hit the bottle and hit the sack
6600601 you just proved my point indians dont like to hit people they like to hit objects thats why theyre so good at cricket
6600602 thats not true at all you cant make generalizations about 1 1 billion people some of us are nonviolent and some of us are quite violent some of us are like gandhi and some of us are like ihdnag
6600603 thats gandhi spelt backwards some of us are good at chess and scrabble and some of us are good at boxing and wrestling thats why im thrilled about these medals they show the whole world that indians can be tough
6600604 no they show the whole world that some indians can be tough not you bala but them
6600605 really okay heres a scenario two guys approach you in a dark alley and call you names what would you do would you do any hitting
6600606 we expect the total industry to soften for the second half of this year
6600607 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6600608 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
6600609 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6600610 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6600611 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6600612 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6600613 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6600614 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death
6600615 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6600616 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6600617 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6600618 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6600619 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6600620 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6600621 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6600622 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6600623 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6600624 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6600625 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6600626 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6600627 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6600628 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6600629 the ban created hatred and anger amongst our supporters as the sipah e sahaba pakistan is patriotic and its leaders were chosen by the people to be members of parliament
6600630 reiterates his rejection of such indiscriminate and reprehensible acts of terrorism and extends his condolences to the families of the victims and to the government of pakistan
6600631 bush expressed to prime minister gillani the united states strong commitment to working with the prime minister and the government of pakistan to address the ongoing battle against extremists and to assist pakistan through its current economic situation
6600632 his efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as the fight against al qaeda and extremist groups
6600633 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6600634 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign and if that is not respected then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition
6600635 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6600636 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6600637 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
6600638 but we could not have got the forest fires under control without them
6600639 without those turkish pilots helping with the borjomi fires we could have had an environmental disaster
6600640 turkey has assisted other countries in fire fighting before this is normal for us

6600648 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6600649 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6600650 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6600651 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6600652 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6600653 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6600654 investment banks had been frustrated with the established exchange because they really were never able to get control of it

6600661 the doctors told me the bad news the sam we loved was gone they were keeping a fragile shell of her alive
6600662 it was the hardest most heartbreaking decision ive ever had to make to tell the doctors to let my beautiful sam slip away into her long sleep i wept like a child

6600666 no conforme con eso usan el frente francisco de miranda para colocar como coordinadores de los centros electorales a militantes de psuv a esto se le suma la presencia de las milicias que tambi n son afectos del oficialismo tenemos una situaci n donde debemos estar alertas
6600667 estamos en una escalada donde el actual gobierno mediante maniobras de toda naturaleza busca controlar el proceso electoral se les ha dado orden a los activistas del psuv para que traten de controlar las presidencias de las mesas electorales
6600668 tratamos de averiguar el trasfondo de estas acciones y del inter s por controlar los cuadernos de votaci n les pido a las fuerzas opositoras permanecer con los ojos bien abiertos les hago un llamado a todas aquellas personas que han sido preseleccionadas como miembros de mesa a cumplir con este deber no renuncien a esta posibilidad

6600673 i havent seen the movie and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
6600674 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r ard is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word

6600686 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6600687 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6600688 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6600689 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6600690 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6600691 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6600692 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6600693 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6600694 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6600695 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6600696 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6600697 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6600698 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6600699 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6600700 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6600701 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6600702 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6600703 oh and also a pair of those nice board shorts for my friend here
6600704 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6600705 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6600706 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6600707 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6600708 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6600709 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6600710 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6600711 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6600712 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6600713 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6600714 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6600715 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6600716 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6600717 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6600718 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6600719 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6600720 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6600721 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6600722 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6600723 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6600724 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6600725 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6600726 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6600727 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6600728 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6600729 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6600730 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6600731 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6600732 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6600733 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6600734 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6600735 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6600736 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6600737 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6600738 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6600739 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6600740 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6600741 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6600742 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6600743 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6600744 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6600745 the gtr is the corvette for enthusiasts who want an exclusive distinctive automobile
6600746 its an uncompromising combination of great looks and racetrack capable performance
6600747 americans are not willing to risk this relationship with china
6600748 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp
6600749 i think the one thing i want to make clear at the camp is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year
6600750 we have three massive test series in the next year
6600751 we invited them to see a practical demonstration of the security during two exhibition matches for which we have given the dates of august 22 and 30 but we have not received any reply
6600752 we are still pressing for that to happen so that doubts can be removed
6600753 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6600754 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6600755 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6600756 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6600757 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6600758 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6600759 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6600760 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6600761 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6600762 if the icc shifts the champions trophy to any other venue pakistan will pull out from the event
6600763 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6600764 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6600765 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6600766 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

6600788 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6600789 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6600790 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6600791 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6600793 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6600794 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students

6600797 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion

6600803 you know its kind of weird that the idiotic american dietetic association has us eating a 65 to 70 percent carbohydrate diet the one thing we actually dont even need

6600805 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
6600806 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
6600807 the courts ruling monday sends a clear message that all health care consumers must be treated fairly and equally and that doctors cannot pick and choose when to provide medical treatment based on a persons sexual orientation or any other irrelevant characteristic
6600808 many lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people are afraid to seek out medical care because they are fearful of being treated badly by doctors and other health care providers the courts decision strongly affirms that california will not tolerate harmful discrimination in the health care arena
6600809 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
6600810 this case was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
6600811 the physicians in this case had determined to only provide reproductive services to married patients thats hardly a novel or extreme ethical position physicians of course must treat all patients with compassion and respect regardless of the belief systems or sexual norms of the patients but tolerance is a two way street we must also respect the right of healthcare professionals to make decisions based on ethical standards
6600812 it is more surprising that clear channel communications which owns 94 1 and six other radio stations in town would miss the point that exclusionary promotions are unwise

6600850 as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
6600851 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
6600852 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses
6600853 when the law gives a couple responsibilities without equality the law must be changed

6600857 he has a very radical view of whats a family
6600858 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
6600859 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
6600860 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
6600861 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about

6600868 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6600869 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6600870 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6600871 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6600872 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said

6600903 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6600904 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6600905 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6600906 the other project you are referring to is in no way connected to the eurovision song contest and i do not see any possibilities for us to get involved
6600907 we are used to other parties commercial political special interests etc trying to take advantage of our well renown event for their own purposes
6600908 thats why we need to draw a clear line of our responsibilities regarding the gay issue we recognise this situation from earlier this year where there also were some rumours on planned attacks on gays during the esc in belgrade and as then we will not next year start to divide our fans into groups based upon their religion color of the skin or sexual preferences we will again seek necessary guarantees from the authorities that they guarantee the security for all our fans

6600912 i am now sitting in the office and try to get hold of family and friends
6600913 it is not so easy for me to make clear points so obviously i need to stop writing and go back to why i came to office to back up all our workfiles in case office is bombed i thank you for thinking of us and i wish peace to all of you no matter where you are by the way we are out and publicly visible you can see that in our magazine as well

6600921 on nov 4 about three months from now if we do not stop the drive to legalize marriage between homosexuals that battle will be lost
6600922 for the sake of your children and the future of our nation
6600923 im counting on you to underwrite production and distribution costs of this documentary
6600924 i have been struck by how much more immediate unearned credibility and respect i get as a completely average looking man than i did as a visibly masculine appearing woman the difference is stark whether it is service in a restaurant or on a plane or appearing in court
6600925 i would be a fabulous gay man because im funny and i love to decorate
6600926 my sister was gay my best friends were gay so i figured i had to be gay so i did everything they did i tried kissing girls but it didnt feel right for me and eventually i was forced to come out as a heterosexual
6600927 when i hear people like george bush talk about the gay community being anti american it makes my blood boil the guy who saved the white house one of the heroes who crashed that plane on 9 11 was gay the rugby player mark bingham who died on united 93 and does bush ever mention that that gay guy saved his lousy ass
6600928 the numbers of gays and lesbians far outweigh those of trans and gays and lesbians pay for our communitys struggles as volunteers and donators and weve still got a lot to do trans issues are also important and perhaps they should be included in the overall agenda though it seems this has become an assumption of our leaders without there first being a genuine debate about it meanwhile any organization that buys into the idiotic and insulting concept of hierarchies of oppression is not getting a donation from me
6600929 i have already said that it was slander and lies
6600930 i was born in a small logging town on the olympic peninsula of washington state at olympic memorial hospital my family and i enjoyed spending vacations at olympic national park where our favorite spot was the olympic hot springs i was able to finish high school one year early due to credits earned through olympic community college in bremerton i then attended college in olympia the capital of washington state since 1889 where i belonged to a club that spent weekends hiking in the olympic mountains i earned my way through college by working at the olympic boat center knowing more about boats than cars due to my upbringing in this olympic environment upon graduation i moved to the community of bellingham where i lived on olympic drive until i moved near seattle where i enjoy having guests stay at its premier hotel the olympic four seasons
6600931 and who are not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press
6600932 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6600933 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6600934 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6600935 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6600936 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6600937 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6600938 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6600939 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6600940 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6600941 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6600942 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6600943 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6600944 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6600945 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6600946 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6600947 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6600948 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6600949 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6600950 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6600951 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6600952 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6600953 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6600954 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6600955 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6600956 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6600957 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6600958 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6600959 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6600960 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6600961 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6600962 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6600963 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6600964 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6600965 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6600966 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6600967 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6600968 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6600969 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6600970 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6600971 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6600972 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6600973 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6600974 ele ficava resmungando o tempo todo dizendo que a escola era uma perda de tempo
6600975 please god give me consumption and take away these sticky dreams
6600976 im an aunt for the second time and i dont even know how it happens
6600977 its the bitch of living with nothing but your hand just the bitch of living as someone you cant stand
6600978 i wouldnt be so excited about that if i was you
6600979 the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how she is treated
6600980 if i call you a stinkweed does that make you a stinkweed
6600981 i had really wild dreams when i was a kid of being a rock star
6600982 now what i thought that meant though was i would just make records and sing and be loved by everyone and never have a problem again in my life i didnt actually realize that i would have to live a life while i was being a rock star
6600983 and some just amazing things have happened to me the oscar was just over the top and singing with bruce springsteen its just been so many wonderful things that have happened its hard to say which one is the best
6600984 the whole focus of my life the perception of what life is was changed by my diagnosis and subsequent treatment the treatment was the part that really got me because its a hideous thing they do all the chemotherapy and it takes you so close to death
6600985 and it really opened my eyes because when my body was in this state of near death i discovered my soul i started to see that there was a lot more to us than the television and the clothes we wear and the cars we drive its what my whole new album is about
6600986 oh my gosh i have four children oh my god
6600987 its the best thing i do its the greatest thing i do is to be a mom its the most important thing i do its my ultimate joy and happiness is being a wife and mother i try to be my best at my professional world so i can go home and do my best at home
6600988 it really does require an awesome amount of patience and understanding of life and living in the now they really bring you right into but i want it now and you have to take charge of whats happening right this moment
6600989 i dont consciously go and use my celebrity for this but what ive noticed is being a celebrity the opportunities are wide open
6600990 i am constantly asked every day if i can do this or do that and i have to say no to a lot of things
6600991 yet there are the causes that are near and dear to me because they are part of me gay rights youre talking about my life there of course i am going to be involved in that it would be hypocritical of me not to and then the cancer issues and the family issues and children the things that i am are the things that i feel called to
6600992 thats the thing that i do by myself all alone in my little room and i try to translate what comes into my subconscious my higher conscious and i try to bring it into this realm of understanding with music and thats my craft thats my challenge
6600993 see what comes along and what i want to do is keep making my music that makes me very happy
6600994 its called the revival tour because there are a lot of spiritual themes not only in the album the awakening but in this tour
6600995 and i wanted people to know theres a little bit of extra sprinkles on top of this you can come and rock out were going to sing im the only one at the top of our lungs and were going to talk about life
6600996 the way that the show is structured its actually my life story from kansas on out and through the cancer its a way to put all of these songs together in a cohesive manner so i called it the revival tour and i try not to get too preachy but i try to inspire and entertain thats my hope

6601017 i could eat a lot of different foods using this sauce
6601018 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6601019 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6601020 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6601021 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6601022 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6601023 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6601024 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care

6601036 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6601037 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6601038 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6601039 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6601040 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6601041 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6601042 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6601043 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6601044 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6601045 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6601046 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6601047 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6601048 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6601049 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6601050 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6601051 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6601052 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6601053 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6601054 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6601055 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6601056 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6601057 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6601058 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6601059 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6601060 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6601061 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6601062 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6601063 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6601064 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6601065 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6601066 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6601067 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6601068 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6601069 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6601070 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6601071 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6601072 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark

6601088 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6601089 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6601090 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6601091 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6601092 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6601093 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6601094 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6601095 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6601096 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6601097 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6601098 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6601099 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6601100 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6601101 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6601102 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6601103 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6601104 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6601105 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6601106 its a bit like if you have got a family pet when the vet says to you there is nothing more we can do and the animal is suffering ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6601107 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6601108 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6601109 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6601110 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6601111 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6601112 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6601113 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6601114 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6601115 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6601116 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6601117 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6601118 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6601119 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6601120 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6601204 these results suggest that youth drinking could be reduced if parents and family members better understood the risk of harm to youth that alcohol presents as well as ways to prevent youth from accessing alcohol kept in the home
6601205 the reasons for substitution may have to do with cigarette price increases and or smoking prohibition in public places such as schools malls and restaurants

6601219 st george and the dragon as the a puppet theater in paris 1963

6601221 explain things we dont understand using stories that cannot be proven
6601222 cant you see im busy dont you have stuff you should be doing like counting bullets or terrorizing the new recruits
6601223 i make the newbies count the bullets and i leave the terrorizing to ronon you know good cop bad cop sort of thing
6601224 i thought id come down here and see if you needed any help testing that polymer
6601225 yes well about that it looks like were going to need some time to process the chemical analysis of that material before were prepared to do any more testing on its um physical properties
6601226 ive got other people working on it now but its likely to take weeks
6601227 im surprised you did not correct the colonel on his pronunciation of the word polymer
6601228 um yeah about that sorry i couldnt make it there was a last minute thing
6601229 i am sure there was something important that you needed to address last night john it is of no matter rodney and i had a pleasant evening together
6601230 troy was the greeks but since the romans stole everything from them youre close enough
6601231 you cant possibly allow him to think that there was anything remotely the same about the greeks and the romans not to mention dismissing one of the greatest cultures in western civilization well on earth anyway by boiling it down to centurions and gladiators
6601232 do you mind im trying to have breakfast here can you two twelve year olds possibly hold your discussion of roman history at a more appropriate time
6601233 it took place in the city of rome hence the title
6601234 it was you know that when that movie came out probably half the women who saw it ran out and had all their hair whacked off whether it suited them or not and let me tell you not many women can get away with that gamine look
6601235 a slender young girl usually described as waiflike or elfin in nature
6601236 it would be more appropriate to use the term elfin to describe a persons appearance and elfish to describe something being elven in origin like weapons or armor
6601237 you do know there arent really any elves right mckay
6601238 the movie was about someone who chose duty over love it was ultimately very sad
6601239 anything youd like to tell us unofficially about the people were meeting today the whosits the beltans
6601240 you were charged with the important duty of acting as a guide to our new friends and leading them to the ruins that dr mckay wished to inspect it was rude of you to abandon them before your duty was complete
6601241 and dr mckay kept nagging me about keeping up with my studies
6601242 when i said i wanted to learn how to use weapons and fight the colonel agreed with dr mckay
6601243 what til i tell sheppard he lost major cool points by taking mckays side
6601244 you must forgive me for my sons thoughtlessness i will make him apologize to the colonel and dr mckay on their return
6601245 you did warn them against trying to come back across the shadowlands didnt you
6601246 well i mean everyone knows not to cross the shadowlands in the spring
6601247 glare before turning back to teyla and ronon with a stiff smile on his face
6601248 theyll be fine im sure after all how much trouble can two grown men get into yes
6601249 nekko has returned here without you timor informs me that there are some local conditions of which you might not be aware and should know about before you make the return journey to the village
6601250 timor suggests that you avoid crossing the shadowlands on your return
6601251 the ground itself is treacherous at this time of year with many deadly bogs the weather too is unpredictable with highly variable extremes in temperature and unexpected storms as well as heavy fogs
6601252 timor suggests that you pick up something to use as a walking stick and test the ground in front of you as you move he also says to avoid walking across any ground where the vegetation is excessively bright green in color that often indicates a bog underneath
6601253 he says that the fog can roll in without warning and in addition to making it impossible to safely see your way it can cause death through hypothermia if you see a weather front coming in you should seek shelter right away he has also suggested that the two of you wait at your current location and he will send someone to guide you in
6601254 well be fine well check in every fifteen though sheppard out
6601255 well lets not stand around waiting for it to get colder
6601256 hello deadly bogs remember or did you sleep through the part when we discovered we were actually standing in the middle of the local equivalent of the fire swamp
6601257 ah cmon rodney theyre probably all scared off by the bogs
6601258 but when i was a child i was taken to see lawrence of arabia did you ever see it i dont remember much about it aside from the fact that it was incredibly long except for the scene where the little arab boy gets sucked into the quicksand it happened so fast and lawrence tried to save him and he couldnt and the look on peter otooles face when the boy goes under was just awful
6601259 did you ever see a movie or read a book that didnt traumatize you as a child
6601260 if you can still see the ridge timor suggests following that to where a hunters hut is located you can seek shelter from the storm there it should be stocked with food and wood to make a fire
6601261 food and warmth are good things how long do these storms usually last
6601262 timor says that the weather is very unpredictable in the early spring here sometimes a few hours sometimes a few days he says at the very least you will probably be stranded overnight which is why it is imperative that you locate shelter as soon as possible i will notify elizabeth of the delay in our return colonel
6601263 of all the possible ways in which we could bite the dust here in pegasus dying from exposure didnt even make the top twenty five
6601264 enough wood and peat moss for fuel to last us a few days dried meat and fruit some containers of water a couple of pots and pans a covered hole in the ground for a privy definitely not the ritz but it will do
6601265 first things first a fire and then out of these wet clothes right and then something to eat to keep our strength up
6601266 well god knows weve been through it often enough crap its really cold in here
6601267 and some power bars that should help with the food situation
6601268 with two sticks and a piece of string and several hours and lots of determination however i would like to get warm and have something hot to eat sometime this evening so if you could just step aside
6601269 hello canadian man offering to start a fire for you here
6601270 what are you still doing wearing those wet things you need to take those off right now do you want hypothermia
6601271 i have another jacket in the pack if you like
6601272 you certainly packed enough crap no wonder your back hurts all the time all this and the equip
6601273 thats the one theres probably another pair of socks as well though next time it would seem i need to bring an entire change of clothing
6601274 i hate wet feet and the blisters that go with them
6601275 the cot disintegrated on me and dont you say a fucking word you hear me sheppard not one word
6601276 if you dont need any help uh extricating yourself theres plenty of room here on the floor
6601277 no im freezing to death over here youre blocking all the heat can we just i dont know rotate or something
6601278 you put out heat like a nuclear reactor you probably burn something like 300 calories an hour just sitting still no wonder everyone wants to sleep next to you
6601279 i mean that is to say off world you know when its really cold
6601280 sorry sorry i was just cold thats all it wont happen again sorry
6601281 youre going to make me eat not porridge arent you
6601282 im not going to make you do anything youre not comfortable with
6601283 i just thought hot cereal would stick with us longer on the way back this morning
6601284 the weathers lifted eat up and get dressed we should head out soon
6601285 i am never going off world again without at least a packet of instant coffee on me
6601286 im not that far from the edge i just need to turn around here
6601287 ronon teyla this is rodney we have an emergency sheppards in a bog and going down fast i need you
6601288 timor is bringing assistance it is only necessary that you keep the colonels head above the surface until we get there do you understand me rodney do not attempt to pull him out on your own
6601289 were not all that far from the tree line i mean we can see it from here just hurry okay only be careful because this bog stuff could be anywhere
6601290 well keep the channel open teyla so you can track our signal
6601291 you need to be as still as possible everything will be fine
6601292 just for like two seconds i would like to live in teylas world
6601293 im not saying i dont want her to say these things ive come to depend on her saying them just like ive come to depend on ronon to provide brute force or some lightening fast lethality just like i need you to look at me when were in a terrible situation and assure me that no matter how bleak things look we will get out of it okay
6601294 just like you guys need me to point out all the really obviously bad things in any given situation because im right of course as usual but this gives you all the opportunity to pull some sort of crazy heroic stunt and dont think i dont know that youre making it up as you go along colonel just to prove me wrong
6601295 look be careful okay you dont want to get too close here
6601296 look you need to lie back maximize your surface area here ive got you itll be okay
6601297 ive lost too many people on this expedition to stupid senseless stuff
6601298 killer viruses suicide being in the wrong place at the wrong time not picking the short straw for gods sake you you i expect to lose almost every day know it deep down that some day it will happen and ill be powerless to prevent it but not because of a stupid fucking bog
6601299 i prayed for the strength of ten grinches plus two
6601300 admit it its not like you havent thought it before
6601301 i just suddenly have this mental image of radek wearing an antler tied to his head
6601302 we believe we have a visual on your position we should be there within minutes is everything alright
6601303 were good teyla take your time rodney got me out of the bog were just taking a little breather thats all
6601304 we thought perhaps it is good to know that the two of you are alright
6601305 i wouldnt touch that one with a thirty nine and a half foot pole
6601306 yes yes do come in by all means make yourself at home
6601307 thats my fault i havent exactly been clear have i
6601308 um no a guy could get whiplash trying to keep up here
6601309 look im sorry okay i just had second thoughts alright
6601310 it didnt have anything to do with you well not directly anyway i mean it wasnt a rejection of the idea of you if you follow what im saying it was just me thinking that yeah right not to mention the whole surprise factor when i realized that it was even a remote possibility and then not wanting to screw up what was probably the best relationship ive ever had i mean in a working sense and besides
6601311 i just couldnt see me giving you what you wanted i mean look at you
6601312 you are like hotness personified and could have your pick of anyone and i mean anyone here in atlantis or even pegasus for that matter so it was a stretch to presume that you could well want me
6601313 so what youre saying rodney is that you made an offer but chickened out because of my looks
6601314 my looks yeah lets talk about that people have been telling me my whole life that im a good looking guy and ill admit ive taken advantage of that fact whenever i could but im well aware of how impermanent a trait that is being good looking is an accident of genetics like the ata gene it has nothing to do with me as a person and let me tell you being attractive
6601315 hasnt stopped people from leaving me hanging out to dry my entire life
6601316 no matter what else is or is not happening between us you cant stand there and tell me that we havent had your back every single time since weve been here even when you were stuck in the time dilation field you might have thought wed abandoned you but we hadnt as you well know and not just us as in your team but this whole entire expedition were behind you 100
6601317 where do you want it to leave us that is what exactly do you mrmph
6601318 yeah i have a problem with the way theyre wanting to look at my feet
6601319 tenemos que pensar en ello pero no me gustar a adelantar detalles de la trama
6601320 esta vez hemos pasado mucho tiempo trabajando en la historia hemos trabajado con guionistas de hollywood para asegurarnos que lo hacemos bien y creo que esto es algo inusual en la industria de modo que creo que la gente se sorprender bastante del resultado
6601321 i cant even believe the pressure this guys gonna be under hes gotta carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and lead the entire nation millions will look up to him while others will look down on him under close scrutiny
6601322 it was late at night and my eyes were getting kind of blurry and i noticed florida all the way to the bottom tip of texas on my globe looked like they followed obamas hairline on his side profile i sketched out obama on the computer and put a map of the u s around his head and it fit perfectly america with all its ills and beauty with all its economic racial religious and political problems weighing heavy on obamas mind but for the first time in a very long time there seems like theres hope
6601323 from now on my lawyer will explain my georgia policy to you mrs merkel
6601324 in much of europes public debate the true meaning of human rights has degenerated into a tool that gives anti americanism an aura of legitimacy the real horrendous human rights violations in the middle east north korea china cuba etc are largely ignored or relegated to news blurs on the back pages for front page coverage you need an american angle
6601325 i discovered that european social democracy too was a kind of fundamentalism rigid and doctrinaire yielding what swedish writer johan norberg calls
6601326 in the european media as well as on the public stage prizes and publicity go overwhelmingly to americans who serve as witnesses against their own government and nation
6601327 after all they are saying this too so how can we be accused of anti americanism
6601328 the point is to be aware that for many of the foreigners issuing what they claim to be
6601329 to get an impression take a look at davids medienkritik a web log in english dedicated among other things to exposing biased reporting on the united states in the german media be it stories about the war in iraq the conduct of u s soldiers abroad american reservations regarding the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court or even the katrina disaster more often than not the german public is presented with a distorted picture there are laudable exceptions but generally the blows are low and the public is left to form its opinion base on half truths and false analyses
6601330 negative sentiments and views have been driven not only or even primarily by what the united states does but rather by an animus against what europeans have believed that america is while the politics style and discourse of the bush terms and of president bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone its disappearance
6601331 the protests against nuclear weapons for instance concentrated on american weapons the anti war rallies were against american led wars the anti death penalty campaign focused on texas a pattern was emerging and has never seriously been altered a pattern of willingness to condemn america for the tiniest indiscretion or to magnify those indiscretions while leaving the murderers dictators and thieves who run other nations oddly untouched
6601332 a fundamental problem in european media is the disproportionately high levels of attention coverage interview time and credibility granted to american anti americans and representatives of the american left as opposed to americans representing other viewpoints whether moderate libertarian conservative etc the result is a skewed understanding of what the united states really is
6601333 in five years there will be a different president and iraq will likely be pacified that would naturally have impacts on the strength of the resentments that have fixed themselves onto certain individuals in the present situation but beneath the surface smolder the long burning embers of latent anti americanism it has a long tradition and will remain also when president bush is no longer in office and palestine is peaceful
6601334 yet the tensions between american and european worldviews ultimately have little to do with specific policies europe is an increasingly pacifist continent which is an improvement upon its bloody history but a source of inevitable tension with a superpower that must occasionally enforce world order european governments generally view international institutions as a way to constrain american power any future american president will continue to view those institutions as a way to amplify our influence in keeping the peace
6601335 the best web guide to the german media is davids medienkritik
6601336 davids medienkritik is an essential read for a perspective on the european media
6601337 without a doubt the best thing they have done since the black album destroys anything from the last three albums
6601338 i just listened to it full volume 3 times in a row it takes a while but then turns on the after burners good stuff looking forward to the new album sounds like rick rubin got them back on track
6601339 i give them an a for effort and a b in execution this is definitely a huge improvement from

6601342 there are people like dick lugar a republican who id listen to on foreign policy
6601343 do you agree with senator lieberman that senator obama has not put the country first
6601344 no i think that was clearly a partisan statement at a rally i respect everybody their opinions in a political campaign but thats all that was
6601345 well they better pick lynsay and i dont care if she is the only canadian that should not go against her

6601371 maybe i have more opportunities as a designer over there but im making a bigger statement over here
6601372 in the same way that italy i want aschobi to stand for african fashion
6601373 everybody thinks i should be in paris london or new york
6601374 ive given up a lot to be here and i miss paris and the fashion life in america but this is really important to me
6601375 this is my only job this is my life actually
6601376 we have a lot who are returning who are very successful with the experience and skills the country needs but of course the salary is not there
6601377 a lot of them are even leaving family behind but theyre making these sacrifices to come back and help the development of the country
6601378 i do not like to talk about politics all that i like to do is business business and business all over the world we talk about gender equality and one way to promote this is to help women entrepreneurs
6601379 many people here have this resistance factor to returnees because they feel that unlike those in the diaspora they themselves stayed here throughout the war and suffered and now they should get all the jobs
6601380 they see it in your face you look fresh and wholesome and they hear it in my accent i probably have to be living here five years before people accept me

6601386 the cover photo alone enraged me with the pastor wearing baggy jeans and untucked button up shirt with flip flops and an ear microphone later the same guy is shown out front of a church holding a paper starbucks like cup of coffee could he try any harder to be lame id have liked to have taken that cup of coffee and dumped it on his head but its nothing personal against that guy or his beliefs or sincerity its an anger at something else
6601387 it is interesting however how one can judge and cateragize a person and a church with no more evidence than just a picture
6601388 its nothing personal against that guy or his beliefs or sincerity its an anger at something else
6601389 yeah julie i agree with you youre awesome i think we should dress up in suits and ties for church

6601402 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6601403 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6601404 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6601405 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6601406 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6601407 the man shot to death at 11 35 p m tuesday outside his apartment in the bavaria complex at 4501 packard drive is identified as
6601408 martin and a friend had just arrived in the complex and were walking to martins apartment when they were approached by a man near the parking lot who asked to use a phone
6601409 the suspect is described as a young black man approximately 59
6601410 anyone with information on the suspect is urged to call crime stoppers at 74 crime or south precinct investigations at 862 7763
6601411 i wonder if we have clipped the wings of the wild goose and settled for something less much less than what god originally intended for us
6601412 i dont know a single christ follower who hasnt gotten stressed out over trying to figure out the will of god we want to solve the mystery of the will of god the way we solve a sudoku or crossword puzzle but in my experience intellectual analysis usually results in spiritual paralysis
6601413 we try to make god fit within the confines of our cerebral cortex we try to reduce the will of god to the logical limits of our left brain but the will of god is neither logical nor linear it is downright confusing and complicated
6601414 if you would describe your relationship with god as anything less than adventurous then maybe you think youre following the spirit but have actually settled for something less something i call inverted christianity
6601415 i wonder if churches do to people what zoos do to animals
6601416 do angels yawn i know it seems like an inane theological question but i seriously wonder if angels have the capacity to get bored more important i wonder if some of us are living such safe lives that not only are we bored but so are our guardian angels if they could would our guardian angels coax us out of our cage and beg us to give them something dangerous to do
6601417 many if not most christians are bored with their faith
6601418 abba rocks anyone who says otherwise is probably mourning too deeply over the loss of george carlin and needs to be kicked while theyre down
6601419 i told you that id know nothing and that is the truth
6601420 time flies like an arrow fruit flies like a banana
6601421 that excessive emotions require some adjustments but what about the lack of emotions when and where they are surely appropriate such as the tears i shed that one night you guys thought it was inappropriate when i teared up over the music it seems to have made you uncomfortable what about not emoting at all
6601422 is it inappropriate to cry in grief over the memory of one whose life is now from memories only is it inappropriate to shout for joy when a older person climbs our hill
6601423 we acknowledge that an excess of anger is destructive but what about the absence of anger altogether say someone deliberately denigrates you and you dont react to it you passively allow such indignities but of course you dont you seethe within you repress your anger and it may be appropriate to moderate it to rein some of it in but if youve been unjustly denigrated do you just allow it lest your just indignation be deemed inappropriate is it inappropriate for a man to tear up over music and lyrics to feel a momentary grief joy loss and all the other feelings
6601424 the hell with this its another but then i was saved praise jesus thing
6601425 lay your sins before god accept jesus into thy heart and you shall be saved
6601426 but not that kind of baptist our pastor is an out lesbian and the head of our new membership committee is pagan
6601427 he was and now i am at a church where the lords prayer starts off with
6601428 god and i are not on speaking terms at the moment
6601429 just be good and youll enter the pearly gates as a reward now back to toiling
6601430 oh i feel so much better having peace of mind
6601431 the feeling of stillness and peace in a life that has not seen much of it
6601432 connecticut is a lot like holland with more hills trees and cows and less flowers
6601433 an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6601434 despite the efforts of centre staff prolonged detention was having a detrimental effect on the welfare and behaviour of children whose fear and distress was strongly reflected in our childrens interviews
6601435 children should be detained only in exceptional circumstances and then only for the shortest time necessary length of cumulative detention should be clearly and accurately recorded
6601436 significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate
6601437 even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs
6601438 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6601439 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system
6601440 those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6601441 yet again there is scathing criticism of the detention of children
6601442 how much more evidence does the government need of the harm detaining children causes before it puts a stop to it once and for all
6601443 the impact on their well being as evidenced by their fear and distress noted by inspectors is simply unacceptable and the legacy of this experience will last well beyond their period of incarceration
6601444 we call for an immediate end to the deplorable practice of detaining children which we believe can never be justified
6601445 er werd mij gisteren verteld waar mijn achternaam vandaan komt
6601446 dont it always seem to go that you dont know what youve got till its gone
6601447 no matter what they do to try to tailor the game to brett they still cant recreate green bay
6601448 so were going to see brett favre play a little different style and im really excited about it
6601449 im hoping its more play action i hope hes holding the ball more dropping deeper i want to see him throw it down the field more because everyone says gunslinger great arm but green bay led the league in short passes
6601450 as a coach you try to decide where that line is and where do we go before we endanger brett favre

6601454 when you go from one playbook to another its like learning a completely different language its not going to be easy im just trying to temper everyones enthusiasm he has a lot to learn and cant go out there and just fling it
6601455 the mental side is going to be tough but i think he can go out there and just fling it he is the best at just flinging it since you boomer
6601456 i think he is one of the five best throwers of the football ever in the history of the nfl he played in green bay all those years i think he can deal with the meadowlands
6601457 as far as adapting to terminology and plays if theres anybody in the league who can do it its him because of the experience hes had
6601458 characterize in the best way the competition among countries displaying clearly the country code
6601459 the sponsors and especially the technical sponsors can show in the best way their brand which is important to maintain a high level prize money

6601567 canada has once again reclaimed its role as the true north strong and free after more than a decade of liberal government rule canadas reputation abroad floundered and even our capacity to patrol our own borders was significantly diminished
6601568 tax relief certainly matters to canadas seniors who are on a fixed income and need to make every penny count
6601569 we will accelerate the plans we first announced two weeks ago for purchasing auction rate securities

6601590 die beste weise euren kameraden die treue zu halten ist es weiter zu machen den kopf zu heben professionell zu handeln
6601591 warum sind wir hier weil es hier um einen teil der freiheit in der welt geht
6601592 alles zur richtigen zeit es gibt eine zeit f r mitgef hl f r solidarit t wir werden die lehren ziehen aus diesem event
6601593 anfang der wochen wurden in afghanistan zehn franz sische soldaten get tet die lage am hindukusch hat sich zugespitzt sind die deutschen soldaten sicher
6601594 hintergrund ist dass die terroristischen aktivit ten immer st rker von pakistan auf afghanistan ausstrahlen und die taliban dort ihr aufmarsch und r ckzugsgebiet haben das bereitet mir gro e sorgen vor allem mit blick auf die grenze afghanistan pakistan dort gehen in bestimmten regionen t glich 60 000 menschen unkontrolliert ber die grenze
6601595 es zeichnet sich ab dass die usa ihren kampf gegen den internationalen terrorismus deshalb nach pakistan verlagern wollen ziehen sie dabei mit
6601596 wir m ssen pakistans grenzen respektieren aber entschieden auf eine l sung des grenzproblems dringen pakistan muss den anti terror kampf st rker unterst tzen
6601597 halten sie einen isaf einsatz in pakistan f r notwendig
6601598 das steht nicht zur diskussion aber abgesehen davon ginge das nicht ohne zustimmung pakistans und ein mandat der vereinten nationen
6601599 unterst tzen sie den einsatz von awacs aufkl rungsflugzeugen ber afghanistan
6601600 erwarten sie widerstand im bundestag f r ein neues isaf mandat
6601601 ich hoffe dass wir ber die mehrheit der gro en koalition hinaus daf r zustimmung finden dem letzten isaf mandat haben auch gr ne und fdp abgeordnete zugestimmt
6601602 themenwechsel kaukasus bundeskanzlerin angela merkel hat die aufnahme georgiens in die nato zugesagt stehen sie dazu
6601603 ich denke es ist gut dass wir neben der seit jahren bestehenden nato ukraine kommission jetzt auch rasch eine nato georgien kommission einrichten
6601604 afghanistan wird ein unkontrollierbarer saustall und wir haben kein interesse uns mehr einzubringen

6601612 the three essential elements every successful business needs productive workspace powerful connections and effective ideas
6601613 seventy three percent of women business owners work by themselves so community is very important
6601614 an awful lot of women worry about being defined by not having a nice space
6601615 the focus has got to be about growth not just i want to go and hang out with other people or i need to get out of the house so the kids are not climbing all over the place
6601616 whether there has been reduced long term precipitation there the jury is out on that but i think we have to be proactive and take a precautionary approach to this
6601617 the unique part of this experiment is that were putting a tracing element indium sesquioxide with the silver iodide as a tracing element so that we can determine using very fundamental science the extent of addition of snow and therefore water that has been accumulated due to the clouding program
6601618 there is certainly great interest in it from overseas who are looking at cloud seeding to augment their water availability
6601619 i just dont understand with all the emphasis on water why the scientific entities are not advocating at least some level of further research in australia so we can catch up with the rest of the world
6601620 cloud seeding is difficult because of these variabilities and its not as though it works everywhere all the time
6601621 conditions just have to be right in the atmosphere for cloud seeding to work and then it becomes difficult even to detect the signals
6601622 cred ca georgia trebuie sa gasesca formule sa inceapa negocieri directe cu federatia rusa este o parere a noastra un punct de vedere si mai mult nu comentam negocierile cu privire la integritatea teritoriala a georgiei sint esentiale si in opinia noastra ele trebuie facute si de partile de care acest lucru depinde in mod direct
6601623 este foarte clar ca in documentul prin care se stabilea incetarea focului se permite raminerea unor trupe a federatiei ruse pe teritoriul georgiei intr o zona tampon din intrepretarile publice pe care le am auzit practic acordul de incetare a focului nu stabileste o revenire pe pozitiile anterioare ale trupelor celor doua state cred ca este obligatia negociatorilor sa clarifice interpretarea documentului semnat
6601624 ori se da o citire diferita a acordului de incetare a focului la tbilisi fata de moscova si la moscova fata de tbilisi ori parca avem de a face cu doua documente usor diferite in forma in care au fost semnate
6601625 noi avem in ambulatoriul integrat un cabinet cu aceasta specialitate unde lucreaza doi medici insa acestia nu au corespondent in spital pacientii trebuie trimisi spre internare in alta institutie oricum este o adresabilitate foarte mare pe acest domeniu
6601626 avind in vedere ca ati fost initiatoare a legii lustratiei adoptata de senatul romaniei in aprilie 2006 ati fost deconspirata ca informator al securitatii in august 2006 si ati avut demnitatea sa va autolustrati dindu va imediat demisia din parlament ati fost exclusa din societatea timisoara care v a retras premiul pe care vi l a acordat pentru promovarea legii lustratiei si a proclamatiei de la timisoara conform legii lustratiei pe care ati initiat o si pentru a nu transforma intr o farsa imorala demersurile dumneavoastra in urmatorii 8 ani nu aveti dreptul moral de a candida la alegerile parlamentare
6601627 in 1999 cind a fost infiintat cnsas l ati propus in cunostinta de cauza din partea pnl pe domnul gheorghe onisoru ca presedinte al colegiului pentru un mandat de 6 ani adica stiind dinainte ca misiunea acestuia va fi sa impiedice din interiorul cnsas deconspirarea securistilor precum c v tudor si altii in primul rind poate chiar a dumneavoastra
6601628 romania risca sa si piarda credibilitatea in fata comisiei europene
6601629 in opinia mea romania risca nu atit sa piarda fonduri cit sa si piarda credibilitatea in fata comisiei
6601630 responsabilitatea mea era sa ne asiguram ca se reiau platile cit mai repede
6601631 sper sa nu ne prinda sfirsitul lui septembrie inceputul lui octombrie fara ca situatia sa fie rezolvata

6601635 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children

6601642 gardutul va fi pus in jurul unei balti din apropiere ca semn de protectie a mediului a biosistemului albastrul este culoarea mea preferata si va reprezenta apa si cerul
6601643 jugul este tot un simbol al rabdarii caracteristica a spatiului moldovean uneori inutila dar datorita careia am supravietuit ca popor
6601644 am ales un proiect pentru culoarea verde doua cabine de telefon una care reprezinta mediul rural cu o casa taraneasca in interior si o alta care reprezinta mediul urban cu niste blocuri iar duminica vom realiza niste interviuri intre cele doua cabine vrem sa aratam cum afecteaza incalzirea globala urbanul si ruralul este un proiect ecologist o sa mai ridicam si o casa de aproximativ 1 70 de cm un proiect pe care il vom realiza cu copiii
6601645 sint lucrari de sine statatoare sau parti componente din alte lucrari pe care trebuie sa le asezam ele vor sta in cuptor vreo opt ore dar apoi trebuie sa mai asteptam pina se raceste de doua ori mai mult fata de cit a durat sa l incingem
6601646 a fost foarte greu sa centralizam toate datele le am spus primarilor ca daca nu aduc necesarul de investitii din comunele lor nu vor mai primi nici un ban pentru investitii anul viitor pina la urma au venit toti la timp
6601647 este nevoie de 1 5 milioane euro pentru infrastructura de mediu 912 milioane euro pentru infrastructura rutiera 304 milioane euro pentru alte investitii in reteaua de transport 109 milioane euro in infrastructura scolara 54 milioane euro pentru domeniul sanatate 2 milioane de euro pentru sistemul judiciar si 220 milioane euro pentru alte tipuri de lucrari
6601648 o parte sint lucrari in continuare iar altele sint lucrari care trebuie realizate in viitor mi a fost greu sa tai ceva din ce am primit de la comune sa nu renunt la un lucru foarte important s au cerut bani si pentru extinderea retelelor de gaz refacerea de biserici construirea unui gard la sediul primariei osoi cu 14 131 euro este foarte bine ca s au prins si extinderi de retele de alimentare cu energie electrica avem case construite de 20 de ani dar care nu au energie electrica
6601649 stiu ca la ipatele s au cerut 13 milioane de euro pentru drumuri
6601650 acest lucru nu este normal sint convins ca asa se intimpla doar 57 60 la suta dintre pacienti primesc medicamente din spital
6601651 medicii din spital spun ca nu le ajung fondurile pentru a cumpara aceste medicamente insa nici fundamentarea listelor de medicamente la spitale nu este facuta cum trebuie trebuie sa reducem cit mai mult acest procent pentru ca de eliminat ma indoiesc ca il vom elimina prea curind
6601652 in ceea ce ne priveste medicii nostri nu dau retete compensate in timpul internarii ci doar la externare au fost informati de catre conducere despre aceasta reglemenater si ei se conformeaza
6601653 poate ca aceste valori ar putea fi valabile in cazul celorlalte spitale dar nu pentru urgente spitalul nostru asigura toata medicatia fara nici o exceptie nu exista reteta compensata in timpul spitalizarii
6601654 de cind sint eu la parhon nici un pacient nu a cumparat vreun medicament
6601655 sint de o saptamina internata in spital ma duc sa caut niste pastile pentru alergie aici in spital nu au
6601656 cred ca acest fenomen trebuie analizat punctual si nu global este posibil sa fi existat si infirmiere care nu au avut un comportament normal sau pe placul pacientilor daca astfel de cazuri exista conducerea spitalului ar dori sa fie informata pentru a lua masuri atunci cind se dovedeste vinovatia persoanei in cauza probabil ca aici mai este de lucrat si vor exista poate chiar si cursuri care sa imbunatateasca comunicarea dintre personalul de ingrijire si pacienti
6601657 facem si noi chestionare iar astfel de nemultumiri sint sporadice nu am primit pina acum plingeri din partea pacientilor oricum depinde si ce inteleg ei prin comportament neadecvat sint pacienti si pacienti
6601658 fiecare salon are televizor dus cu gresie si faianta nu stiu ce este in alte parti dar din punctul meu de vedere la noi infirmierele se poarta exemplar cred totusi ca ar fi alte lucruri pe care sa le studiem cum ar fi faptul ca sintem platiti cu mult prea putin pentru ce facem
6601659 im a wandering spirit no escape and no parole lookin for a place to call my home
6601660 the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun

6601664 dupa sapte luni din acest an piata autoturismelor noi nu va mai fi caracterizata de cresterile cu care ne a obisnuit in anii precedenti nici macar pe aproape o scadere de 1 8 nu este usor de recuperat mai ales daca avem in vedere ca luna august este prin traditie una mai slaba din punct de vedere al vinzarilor iar in ultimele trei luni s au inregistrat scaderi fata de aceeasi perioada din 2007
6601665 de obicei merg cu cel putin trei persoane cu care convin sa imi platesca impreuna cazarea si masa dupa ce studiem ofertele de la auto house uri merg cu un roman care e stabilit in germania de 14 ani la negocierea pretului unei masini el cunoscind foarte bine limba cautarile nu dureaza mai mult de doua zile daca nici clientul nu e foarte pretentios
6601666 pentru asigurarea masinii numerele rosii pe o luna si combustibilul pentru intoarcere mai este nevoie de aproximativ 300 350 de euro
6601667 in march health care stocks were neck and neck with financial stocks for worst performance

6601675 i am really beginning to like reading the mad pigeon i like his take on topics
6601676 this blog instantly caught my eye not because he had a fancy design but because i really liked the content
6601677 its time for a new blog of the time period todays candidate is the mad pigeon im not going to tell you anything about it but trust me youll like it
6601678 i for one regard your blog as one of my daily must reads
6601679 ive yet to read a post of yours that hasnt made me smile think or at least amuse me
6601680 thanks again for keeping us all up to date on popular culture
6601681 you seriously have to be the funniest pigeon ive ever seen flying feathers mad pigeon rules the coop
6601682 just in case i havent mentioned it i think you are bloody brilliant i love your site and i really love your take on things even when i may not agree
6601683 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
6601684 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
6601685 why didnt team barry simply produce the document for the media from the start
6601686 this having fun thing is a lot of hard work
6601687 even though the chinese government has banned the importation of e waste the stuff continues to find its way in
6601688 the list of fisheries and authorized gear does not in any way alter or supersede any definitions or regulations contained elsewhere in this chapter
6601689 i am absolutely delighted to have joined the hilton family and feel privileged to be working with such a recognized brand i look forward to working with them over the coming months off track whilst i continue to work hard on track
6601690 it is fantastic that hilton hotels have had such a passion for motorsport and i look forward to sharing my race experiences with hiltonracing com s thousands of members
6601691 im about 15 pounds heavier ive got highlights in my hair
6601692 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6601693 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6601694 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6601695 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6601696 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6601697 i thought of you when i have this burden to set this program up
6601698 are small and could have occurred as a result of chance
6601699 we believe that the findings in seas on cancer are likely to be an anomaly
6601700 we dont believe in light of all the data that theres an association of cancer with vytorin
6601701 early communication about an ongoing safety review of ezetimibe simvastatin marketed as vytorin simvastatin marketed as zocor and ezetimibe marketed as zetia fda investigates a report from the seas trial
6601702 were having discussions with the business council about the data they used the model they used we will take all that on board when we make our decisions in the national interest
6601703 the question really is is this a string of bad luck or is it indicating a real change in behaviour and the safety culture of the airline
6601704 qantas paid more money to have that plane repaired then it would have cost them to buy a new plane so they could continue to say they have never lost a plane
6601705 when the business travellers desert qantas because of safety fears is when they will be in trouble
6601706 we do find that many flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
6601707 effectively this is not a media beat up but unbelievable exposure of an airline that is the tenth largest in the world i dont think any airline in the world is under as much scrutiny as qantas is in australia
6601708 i havent seen people making the switch but i am sure some people have it is having an impact now but we are 88 years old remarkably resilient and we will come back from this
6601709 we are not blaming them but it has been a big part of the problem we should have those 737 400s back in the air within three or four days though
6601710 hes still in a critical conditon of course hes not out of the woods yet but theyre working on it and they feel there will be a total recovery well theyre hoping so
6601711 im hoping that means not only will he survive but theyll have all of his bodily functions restored he wont be in a wheelchair or anything
6601712 theyd just taken the tube out of his throat and hes still got an oxygen mask on and they put the phone to his ear and he was able to try and talk to me
6601713 i couldnt understand a word he said of course because the tube in the voice box had upset his throat but that was the most thrilling piece of news wed had
6601714 im thrilled that hayden has got such a fighting spirit and that gives me a lot of confidence
6601715 if hed dropped his bundle or something like that that would have been hard to bear
6601716 we heard about it this morning it appears to have been clubbed to death
6601717 that didnt really alarm us at all because we see them all the time from dog attacks
6601718 but they were butchered off a really clean cut maybe with an axe or a surgical instrument
6601719 we dont have any evidence that these two cases are linked
6601720 delaying will only cost the people of nsw more more in the terms of us dollars and more in the sense that more time passes before weve secured our future electricity supplies
6601721 i believe the leader of the opposition has got a unique opportunity here to put the day to day cut and thrust of politics aside and actually do something of value
6601722 early life environments can affect if you are a snorer or not later in life
6601723 perhaps these things like dogs infection might increase the size of the tonsils
6601724 its not clear how the dog and the large family is associated with snoring
6601725 certainly individuals who are exposed to severe airway episodes have recurrent ear infections live in large families where infection is common and have a dog may be more likely to develop an immunologic response in the airways leading to tonsillar and or adenoid enlargement and narrowing of the airway leading to snoring
6601726 i think we should do more studies before we take the dogs away
6601727 were very pleased to see one more tool that we can use to have whats a nutritious good product become even safer
6601728 but were hearing on the order of three to five cents per pound which is not all that much to guarantee safety
6601729 it will be a business decision basically to see if customers are willing to purchase this or not
6601730 i see this probably starting off small to see how consumers will react to it and then perhaps grow to some point
6601731 may not be the futuristic cure all the fda is looking for
6601732 we still think that good agricultural practices good sanitation practices good manufacturing practices are all absolutely essential and actually should be mandated in addition to providing for this choice of irradiation
6601733 irradiation in the production processing and handling of food final rule
6601734 i dont know how hes alive and neither does anybody else
6601735 this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6601736 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
6601737 even with our current extremely high vaccination rates we could have significant pockets of people in outbreaks and if vaccine coverage levels fall we risk many more outbreaks we are concerned
6601738 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6601739 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6601740 cresterea economica nu a mai atins acest nivel din perioada comunista insa nu putem face o comparatie cu cifrele de atunci deoarece se foloseau alti indicatori
6601741 pina in 2012 romania va intra in prima jumatate a tarilor europene ca dimensiune a produsului intern brut pina in 2020 vrem sa ajungem la un pib de 440 450 miliarde euro fiind in primele 9 10 tari din ue
6601742 am primit 4 2 miliarde euro investitii straine directe in conditiile in care nu am avut decit o singura privatizare notabila a electrica muntenia sud
6601743 daca lucrurile continua asa vom putea depasi un prag psihologic de 10 miliarde euro investitii straine directe pe acest an
6601744 ohhhhh in pure delight at a strike no one was ready for
6601745 its certainly a big blow hes been a very significant player for us
6601746 it highlights just how serious this issue is for people with these diseases
6601747 theres still a significant amount of cars that are being sold
6601748 theres definitely been a dramatic shift in the last six to 12 months and the car industry needs longer than that to plan for the future
6601749 we are making the right decisions and bringing the focus in 2011 is the right decision
6601750 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined
6601751 we will assess what more needs to be done to help researchers achieve their goals
6601752 a complex investigation of the hendra disease cases and their causes is already being carried out by an expert veterinary epidemiologist team
6601753 but we will work to identify what needs to be done to accelerate hendra research
6601754 australia needs to increase funding to research emerging diseases such as hendra the center for disease control and prevention in the us is an excellent example
6601755 otherwise an outbreak of a zoonotic disease like hendra that infects australians on a wide scale is a real possibility
6601756 they conducted their response in a thoroughly professional manner i am proud of their efforts
6601757 the real focus of the research really needs to be to better understand how it gets out of bats into horses
6601758 we will now be more aware of the clinical signs of hendra
6601759 when you turn off front end controls word gets out
6601760 nobody knew what it was for who is responsible for that
6601761 it appears to me that some of these decisions almost rise to the level of being criminal
6601762 and looking at this report is almost like looking at crime scene photos
6601763 at evan moor an e book and a paper and ink book cost the same
6601764 lets not change our pricing one iota despite taking 30 40 out of our cost base and not adding any value to the content
6601765 these are incredibly difficult clients and we struggle every day to take care of them
6601766 they want shock value sensationalism and knit pick analysis of religious text in order to satisfy an inference
6601767 responsibility for the success or failure of a nonprofit like the autism society rests dually with management and with the board of directors
6601768 in this case the board did not appear to be engaged to the point of asking appropriate questions and following up on issues related to the societys financial condition
6601769 as your review notes one of the major causes of the deficit was providing services that were not funded but were consistent with the mission of the organization
6601770 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew that believed in the mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with the technical knowledge that they generously used to assist the mission in helping the people of kandahar province sergeant shawn eades was respected by his subordinates his peers and his superiors for his outstanding professionalism and his operational experience and his competence he was a veteran soldier and this was his third tour in afghanistan he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and his friends
6601771 au incercat sa ne ceara cu 2 mai mult decit au avut si noi am refuzat sa le acordam sporul de comision deoarece numarul de roviniete a crescut si afacerea a devenit profitabila
6601772 education is not filling a bucket but lighting a fire
6601773 in conditiile in care anul acesta au finalizat studiile de diploma sau de licenta doua generatii de studenti ultima generatie prebologna si prima generatie bologna ministerul ar fi trebuit sa puna la dispozitia candidatilor de doua ori mai multe locuri subventionate pentru studiile de masterat pentru a oferi acestei generatii aceleasi sanse ca si celor care au absolvit anii trecuti acest lucru nu s a intimplat iar acesta este doar unul dintre aspectele la care ministerul nu s a gindit cind a organizat bugetul universitatilor
6601774 masteratul generatiilor anterioare este incadrat conform legii drept studiu postuniversitar si urmareste aprofundarea unor cunostinte dobindite intr un domeniu la alegerea celui care doreste sa urmeze un masterat pe cind masteratul bologna se face doar pe domeniul de licenta conform legii ministerul trebuie sa ofere minim 50 locuri la masterat pentru absolventii bologna si minim 33 la studiile postuniversitare adica acelea care includ masteratul generatiilor prebologna
6601775 masteratul va deveni obligatoriu pentru studentii care aspira la mai mult decit o functie de executie in doi trei ani cei care si au finalizat studiile universitare inainte de adoptarea prevederilor de la bologna si nu au mai urmat cursuri de masterat vor fi categoric dezavantajati
6601776 am accesat acest program de voluntariat si in urma unei evaluari din partea celor de la corpul pacii am fost acceptati noi trebuie sa punem la dispozitia profesorului voluntar o garsoniera si sa i platim chiria scopul lui elisabeth nu este doar acela de a preda ci de a se si implica in comunitate acesta este motivul pentru care una dintre conditiile organizatiei a fost sa ii punem la dipozitie o locuinta alta decit in internatul scolii

6601779 fata de milioanele de snobi care platesc ani in sir rate la banca pentru a si petrece viata in intersectii

6601791 contra niciunuia dintre ei clubul nu a avut un comportament atit de dur chelsea a facut un control antidoping inopinat si l a dat afara pe adrian dupa numai doua zile niciodata nu a incercat sa atenueze daunele produse ci au vrut sa obtina o compensatie cit mai mare
6601792 chelsea a luat o decizie unilaterala fara sa astepte finalul suspendarii de sapte luni in schimb a ales sa l concedieze si sa ceara daune exorbitante
6601793 am stat de vorba individual cu fiecare jucatoare si am aflat ce pretentii au o sa discutam saptamina viitoare pe aceasta tema cert este ca in acest moment fondul de salarii nu acopera necesarul
6601794 am facut o solicitare la fsi pentru suplimentarea sumelor si asteptam un raspuns mai trebuie sa gasim si sponsori pentru a completa suma necesara
6601795 chiar daca de obicei mergem in control in scoli in timpul activitatii lor am inceput acum vizitele pentru a putea termina pina pe 15 septembrie acum nu putem lua masuri insa daca pina la 1 septembrie nu se rezolva nimic aceasta lipsa de interes a directorilor poate fi sanctionata cu amenda de 4 000 lei
6601796 multi au gasit scuza ca sint noi in functie si inca nu stiu ce au de facut insa asa ceva este inacceptabil dupa inceperea scolii se va trece la sanctiuni si amenzile vor fi pe numele directorilor pentru ca inseamna ca nu au nici un interes sa intre in legalitate daca nu cer autorizatiile
6601797 in urma radiografiilor efectuate se poate confirma ca nu exista o leziune osoasa la cot in urma accidentarii de acum doua zile este prezenta insa o leziune care afecteaza ligamentele colaterale si articulatia
6601798 se arata intr un comunicat al formatiei italiene despre accidentarea lui adrian mutu
6601799 l am cumparat definitiv pe robert neagoe de la steaua am dat multi bani pe el dar nu spun pentru ca e confidentiala suma pe linga neagoe vreau sa il luam si pe vali badea sintem in negocieri avansate
6601800 victor hanescu mi a spus ca ar vrea sa vina sa participe si el la acest turneu dar evolutiile foarte bune din ultimul timp si faptul ca va lua parte la o competitiei in sua face prezenta lui incerta sa speram ca va reusi sa vina pina la urma la brasov
6601801 starea sa de sanatate nu s a ameliorat david se afla inca internat la sectia terapie intensiva

6601803 isj iasi a achizitionat deja cele 49 143 pachete de rechizite gratuite aceste pachete au o valoare de 1 211 009 lei elevii isi vor putea depune dosarele la secretariatele scolilor pentru a putea fi beneficiarii acestui program in perioada 1 19 septembrie 2008
6601804 noul post care va emite de la 1 octombrie va fi cu siguranta si cel mai vesel
6601805 doresc foarte mult sa ne auzim si la iasi nu neaparat pentru ca este orasul meu natal ci pentru ca este al doilea oras ca valoare dupa bucuresti foarte multe radiouri din capitala au incasari bune din publicitate de la iasi
6601806 din fericire vom avea emisiunea din nou in prime time adica dimineata avem noroc de aglomeratia din oras asa putem fi ascultati pina mai tirziu de conducatorii auto blocati in trafic bine ca nu sintem la amsterdam pentru ca olandezii merg la serviciu pe biciclete
6601807 am fost la nisa si la florenta nu am ascuns nicaieri in italia ca sint din romania am intrat in vorba cu un sofer de autobuz care atunci cind a auzit ca sintem in vacanta ne a indicat cele mai frumoase locuri de vizitat din zona apoi in avion si in aeroport ne am intilnit cu foarte multi romani ei mi au spus ca acum nu mai este rentabil sa pleci din romania in italia pentru ca se pot face aceiasi bani si in tara
6601808 era undeva la 40 de kilometri de florenta pe drumul spre abruzzo il tineau secret si de ce nu ar fi facut o daca preturile la firme renumite erau ca in bucuresti insa calitatea nu se compara
6601809 we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams

6601812 doamna ewing cautata cu ciini politisti o clarvazatoare a anuntat o pe miss ellie ca nora sa a fost ingropata intr o padure de sonde fosta sotie a bodyguardului lui j r va rupe tacerea peste citeva minute
6601813 un asemenea razboi poate scapa de sub control foarte usor
6601814 de aproximativ zece zile in strada prof a sesan fosta uranus iluminatul public nu functioneaza au venit intr o zi niste lucratori si au lucrat ceva la un stilp dar problema nu este rezolvata nici acum
6601815 sint atit de suparat si nu inteleg ce se intimpla pot doar sa spun ca tadici nu si a indeplinit obiectivul iar eu nu am motive sa ii prelungesc intelegerea eu si acum dupa trei infringeri consecutive spun cu riscul sa rida lumea de mine ca romania la inceputul acestui turneu avea dreptul si valoare pentru aur
6601816 am plins am fost suparati nu stiu de ce totusi fetele nu se aduna nu am aratat nimic cu ungaria la fel si cu franta daca dupa meciul din sferturi nu am vrut sa ma bag intre antrenor si echipa acum vreau sa discut numai cu fetele vreau sa aflu de la ele ce se intimpla
6601817 au trecut trei ani si jumatate de cind am preluat echipa o formatie care a facut rezultate deosebite la doua campionate mondiale si a reusit si calificarea la olimpiada imi pare rau ca am calificat echipa la jocurile olimpice pentru ca acum cei care nu au facut o au parte de liniste
6601818 de la plecare am spus si sustin si acum ca echipa romaniei poate sa cistige cu orice echipa din lume si poate sa piarda cu orice formatie sintem foarte afectati dupa ultimele rezultate mult mai afectati decit jucatoarele imi asum raspunderea pentru selectie si pentru pregatire dar atit antrenorul duce jucatoarele pina la margine de acolo ele sint principalii actori
6601819 meciul cu suedia este ultimul nu vreau sa mai aud de handbal ma voi dedica familiei am plins ca o proasta tot timpul si am muncit atit de mult ca sa ajung sa nu fac nimic la aceasta olimpiada am stat atitia ani mi am tocit nervii si acum la final nu am nici o satisfactie

6601821 not everyone that saith to me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
6601822 i believe this beautiful structure signifies the confidence held by business leaders throughout the nation in the people of st louis here we have an outstanding example of the companys recognition of the economic possibilities to be developed in st louis
6601823 we wanted something simple and performance driven but with lots of pyro just fire everywhere
6601824 and by all accounts that is exactly what we will be getting this weekend
6601825 europe uses 6 5 litres per person per 10 km
6601826 if they like it and it keeps them quiet i like it
6601827 the interesting thing to me about the show is sort of the shocked reaction of most of my haters who are saying oh my god shes a real person shes a nice normal person and im trying to figure out why you didnt think i was that
6601828 im never going to think of myself as the star ever i got into this to be behind the scenes and provide a service i got pulled involuntarily in the front
6601829 i am very pro eating i am really a jewish mother at heart if you ask anyone in my personal life anyone in my professional life im really like a food pusher im very in support of healthy women and healthy bodies
6601830 why not disclose what kind of toilet paper he uses where do you stop
6601831 then all theyve got to do is form a subsidiary and you can conceal anything
6601832 i hope the local democrats are doing more research than just reading the pot smokers magazine
6601833 in the last 14 months the ddn has run 9 articles based on misrepresentation and innuendo attacking my business even though i meet the highest standards for public disclosure and accountability its shameful
6601834 and because mrs turners business is that of communications and her web site is so complete in listing clients and core competencies i find it interesting that this subsidiary is never mentioned
6601835 it seems to represent at best a very serious error in judgment and quite possibly more than that
6601836 these projects have helped create jobs improve neighborhoods and build new roads
6601837 perhaps my opponent should identify the federal dollars she would like to give back
6601838 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
6601839 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
6601840 if you dont stand behind our troops and support them feel free to stand in front of them
6601841 oil stocks had fallen quite sharply during the decline so theres a bit of a relief rally going on right now
6601842 those stocks have been pounded when they consolidated i think you had a lot of shorts that were willing to cover
6601843 talk of a possible lehman takeover was one of the catalysts for the turnaround it looks like there is some bottom fishing going on
6601844 another nail in the coffin for stocks in the near term
6601845 mccain staffers reported that they had received an envelope containing white powder in mccains campaign office in centennial
6601846 the staff has been quarantined and the building has been evacuated
6601847 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6601848 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6601849 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6601850 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6601851 a call of a suspicious package containing an unknown powder that was delivered
6601852 at this time the scene has been secured and several people who may have been exposed to the substance are being examined by medical personnel
6601853 the substance is being examined to determine if it is hazardous
6601854 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting
6601855 inflation has picked up but some of the underlying components of inflation have moderated particularly oil what can he say
6601856 hes going to have let people understand what his logic is on the trade offs between inflation and the risks of recession
6601857 he will provide an outlook and describe what weve been through in the last year
6601858 the fed remains quite concerned about growth all options are on the table
6601859 i hope we get more clarity from bernanke about the coordination between monetary and fiscal policy
6601860 the feds done yeomans work but there are limits to what the fed can deliver
6601861 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6601862 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives

6602108 but if you erased insert band here then all your favorite bands wouldnt exist
6602109 when i came in here this time last year i just wasnt a complete quarterback
6602110 i didnt quite know how to read and follow all the defenses i didnt know how to read their schemes know where people were coming from i just learned a lot from the quarterbacks and quarterbacks coach david yost who i really owe a lot to
6602111 im competing every day and im putting all that i can into it
6602112 im just trying to get better every day thats one thing ive done a lot better since last year at this time i wouldnt say im 100 percent better but im still competing and getting better every day
6602113 hes definitely a student of the game and he definitely knows everything about it
6602114 he knows where to go with the football thats the main thing
6602115 hes one of those guys who walked onto our program and continues to get better im really pleased with him
6602116 they blitz a lot more you get a few more looks with what theyre doing coverage wise but overall its pretty much the same looks you get with the second and third string defense
6602117 they were afraid he was going to burst on it so team trainer rex sharp calls that shot
6602118 i was ready to come out here and have fun and improve upon what ive done so far this camp
6602119 theres always things i can improve upon making decisions and throwing the ball you always take the positives out of it and thats what im trying to do now

6602128 there needs to be codified criteria what kind of advertising how many years et cetera

6602130 it is the first time the leaders have condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honor his undertakings made to the leaders last year to have election in march 2009
6602131 for the region to speak with a unified voice is a significant step as fijian politics has been a hard nut to crack in our neighborhood region and back yard
6602132 this guy who has been given 18 months to have an election and what hes done is gone back on that commitment
6602133 we need to tell him that the mood of this family of democracy in the region is unanimous
6602134 this is a development of what is called earlier the biketawa declaration that is opposed to the non acceptability of undemocratic practices
6602135 i mean it has never happened before so where do you base the forum if fiji is suspended this will have a lot of implications
6602136 this is a huge crisis for the forum and we must understand the decision to suspend fiji was just a consideration by the leaders at this stage
6602137 i have not got my head around it to think beyond the decision
6602138 the eu has been following the forums lead as mentioned by new zealand prime minister helen clark
6602139 that is an issue fiji should be worried about rather than the forums proposed suspension
6602140 the countries are worried about the signal that is sent if the forum does nothing about the coup in fiji
6602141 i cannot see in my wildest dreams australia or new zealand doing anything on the ground in fiji
6602142 we have issued a strong statement so commodore voreqe bainimarama and he must understand the leaders feel very strongly about what he is doing
6602143 we are not talking about immediate suspension but we certainly want fiji to maintain contact and return to democratic elections
6602144 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6602145 one of the key transmissions of monetary policy is the announcement effect people expect their mortgage rates to fall whenever the reserve bank of australia cuts official rates if they are left wondering if or by how much interest rates will fall in the wake of reserve bank of australia then the blunt instrument of monetary policy becomes well more blunt
6602146 it was very difficult playing the two roles somehow i sailed through
6602147 i was paired opposite akashdeep sehgal and i used to feel quite lost considering his popularity and personality but we really worked hard to establish the chemistry between us slowly we started working as a popular pair on screen
6602148 this has been one of the biggest shocks in my life most of us are clueless as to why the show is going off air even akashdeep is very sad about this
6602149 the trps for the serial had taken a beating recently but that cannot be the reason for suddenly closing this down we were initially told that october 2 would be the last day but later it was preponed to august 21
6602150 in the next seven days all i want to do is sleep throughout the day believe me in the last year i have taken only four days off i want to make up for that after that i am sure ekta has something in mind for me
6602151 i had worked for seven days continuously without sleeping and thus could not take it any more and i had learned those steps at 4 am that day but just could not execute it
6602152 though people think 25 years is a long time in my case i feel it is a short one there has been so much of enjoyment enthusiasm and good feeling when somebody says its 25 years i say oh really i did jagadeka veerudu athiloka sundari 13 years ago but i still remember every shot every incident in between the shots i can recollect as if i did it yesterday
6602153 if we retain bitter things in the memory we will develop a grievance against the person then we will become enemies basically enmity is not good if anybody did something bad i think about what i did that they might have felt bad through self analysis i try to look at how they reacted that way i attempt to wash off the bitterness

6602162 its one of the reasons why i love pastoring a church as well cause there are a lot of people at the church that arent a part of here or football i go to them to be preprared for that part of my life as well i get home on a friday night and i have to start preparing and thinking about what im going to be preaching about on sunday morning it refocuses me instantly or you get a call from someone whos had a baby or someone whos had a life threatening disease come up and you realize that scoreboard isnt anywhere near significant as an issue like this so that probably is something that helps me in my struggle to maintain that balance
6602163 youve got parents that and trust me im not talking about all of them beause it doesnt take but one or two out of 120 sets of parents and everybodys got them they wanna complain my thing is you can complain in the stands all you want if you pay to buy a ticket you got a right to it doenst bother me if you holler at me and stuff just dont holler at my kids and dont holler at my family

6602167 the same evidentiary burden that the district court placed on astra
6602168 the presence of an inert subcoating and a drug core having a micro ph of not less than 7
6602169 found that a person of skill in the art would not have seen a reason to insert a subcoating in the prior art formulation
6602170 was based on apotexs failure to demonstrate that a person of skill in the art would conclude that a negative interaction would take place between the enteric coating and the drug core

6602190 when we started eliminating schools kentucky was in the top 10
6602191 we then eliminated a few more schools then got down to six kentucky was on that list we then just kept a few schools including purdue and indiana because half his school goes to purdue and the other half indiana on the list
6602192 kentucky kept making the cut it was close to home something we considered but did not put a lot of emphasis on we felt if we could get there in two to three hours driving or by plane it was fine thats how florida stayed on the list
6602193 i am a processor of information and my wife is more of a gut person morgan is a combination of both of us
6602194 we listed things we thought we wanted in a school after he got his list down to 19 schools we listed what we wanted and then listed the schools does this school have that
6602195 he wanted to play in the sec he wanted a pro style offense that is progressive he wanted to go south coaching is a big part of it those are the big things and the ability to go to the next level when he finishes his college career
6602196 morgan is 17 years old as a family we have made a lot of decisions until he is 18 or 21 or when he is not in my pocket he can make decisions
6602197 we do talk about things as a family we get advice from all over he has been lucky enough to have mentors around to contribute to what he is doing and to be around some good people
6602198 we visited him when we went to see florida we talked to him several times he gave us a lot of input
6602199 we visited 12 major universities we picked up a little here a little there every time we talked to a coach and found some consistency across the board about information we wanted hes had enough information to feel comfortable about his decision
6602200 peyton gave a quick thumbs up to randy sanders we asked him about coach sanders and he gave a lot of props to randy the fact he worked with peyton and we can see how peyton turned out is a huge plus it was a big deal for morgan to get to talk to peyton and hear what he had to say
6602201 we like chuck a lot hes good at his job and stayed right with us
6602202 we like joker a bunch especially in his position as receiver coach you want an offensive coordinator who will put good receivers in there to help the quarterback
6602203 then there is randy sanders he coached peyton manning he did a great job with andre woodson we really researched this thing kentucky was one two with florida in the sec all year with offense last year that impressed us
6602204 he has been exposed to a lot of competition on a very high level
6602205 there is no question he is smart hes intelligent in class and on the football field as well
6602206 i have a hard time believing there is a better athlete in the country right now than he is he is a good quarterback too that is where hell play in college i dont know what is out there quarterback wise but athletic wise he would be hard to beat hes just in another world athletically from everybody else kentucky is getting a great player

6602210 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6602211 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently i was interested because these were documents that no one could find if theres information to be found on the internet im a citizen journalist it was a challenge
6602212 the listing in there quite clearly is he kexins birth date january 1 1994
6602213 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6602214 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6602215 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age
6602216 the conventions the idea that theyre not news thats baloney
6602217 what is more exciting than electing the president of the united states
6602218 many of the best journalists i know are driven in large part by ego they claim an independent streak but theyll do anything to please a boss who talks their language and challenges them to be great they are energized by top editors wholl stop by their desk and talk about stories not to fulfill an mbo but passionately and informally they want to be empowered to find the best story not told what the story is by a manager who hasnt reported on the street in years
6602219 author robin goldstein was curious about how wine spectator magazine determines its awards of excellence for the worlds best wine restaurants so he submitted a nomination for a fake restaurant along with a menu and wine list that he dreamed up and paid the 250 fee the result his imaginary restaurant osteria lintrepido won the award of excellence as noted in the august 2008 issue of wine spectator

6602226 as a child my father and i followed closely behind by my mother made annual visits to the minnesota state fair dressed in my shawl and dark ankle length dresses these remain happy memories for me memories of a time when families visited the fair without fear of pornographic assault it was a warm golden time when america was reassured by the moral strength projected by richard nixons white house a time when families were buttressed against cheap hollywood vulgarity by spiritually anchored programming such as hee haw and the rev jimmy swaggarts camp meeting hour which my father ordered on lps and played for us sunday nights on the victrola

6602247 just one year ago there was no such thing as a netbook the word simply didnt exist today however everyone and their contract manufacturer seems to have at least one of a new breed of diminutive portables available for sale or looming just over the horizon this explosion of interest in what was formerly the budget subnotebook space all started with asus eee pc an unlikely hero saddled with a low resolution 7
6602248 just when we thought we would no longer receive any more 9600 gts because we figured wed reviewed just about every single one on the market asus has decided to run around and release a new one the particular card were looking at today is part of the republic of gamers collection which is something we tend to see more in the motherboard department it makes a lot of sense though that asus are going to expand this popular naming scheme out to more than just motherboards this new card comes to us as the en9600gt matrix matrix is also something we havent heard of from asus before so it will be interesting to see if theyre going to start creating some new lines

6602259 whats so great about the top line up from asus is that they dont get a card and just add an extra 10mhz to the core and 20mhz to the memory the top line up of cards are really well overclocked cards that stand out from the competition that latest card to carry the top name comes from the amd team the hd 4870 has quickly become a hot product for so many people thanks to the aggressive performance and even more aggressive price tag today well be checking out how the asus overclocked version goes against a stock clocked offering and see if its worth paying the premium that the top cards carry to get the larger out of the box clocks

6602281 unlike sony vizio is not going to endorse tru2way unless the cable industry can convince us that it will save our customers money and not just increase cables profitability

6602317 id always said id never write a book like this
6602318 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6602319 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6602320 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6602321 and he and about four other people would read that
6602322 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6602323 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6602324 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6602325 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6602326 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6602327 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6602328 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6602329 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6602330 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6602331 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6602332 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here

6602339 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6602340 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6602341 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6602342 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6602343 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6602344 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6602345 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6602346 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6602347 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6602348 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6602349 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6602350 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6602351 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6602352 well do an autposy on the whale to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6602353 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6602354 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6602355 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6602356 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6602357 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
6602358 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6602359 i just hope that he will present this and somehow well get results that will preserve this species for the future
6602360 the amount of sharks killed every year is simply devastating
6602361 its neat now that shes doing this petition because its a purpose to her passion
6602362 theyre just really graceful big and powerful animals that are kind of feared and revered at the same time
6602363 id love to see one it would make my day make my year
6602364 they were brought to their knees by people and hopefully people can bring them back too
6602365 probably every colonial spanish shipwreck that has ever been discovered has had coins that originated in peru
6602366 so it will be interesting to see how successful they are in getting other governments and shipwreck explorers to recognize their interest
6602367 theres a surprising dearth of law on high seas salvage
6602368 while he was cleaning the fish tank in his house he was holding a fish in his hand and went to the toilet for passing urine
6602369 when he was passing urine the fish slipped from his hand and entered his urethra and then he developed all these symptoms
6602370 mentally he was sound and clinically he was absolutely a normal person with no previous history of any psychiatric illness
6602371 these foreign bodies were inserted or applied for autoerotic psychiatric therapeutic or no definite reasons by the patient
6602372 most patients were too ashamed to admit they had inserted or applied any object and usually presented when a complication had occurred from the foreign body such as difficulty in voiding hematuria pain or swelling extravasations or abscess formation our case is a peculiar one
6602373 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond kabir said
6602374 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6602375 as a preservation site for soft bodied creatures it is as good as it comes and is recognised by palaeontologists the world over what we dont yet know what triggered the preservation it may be that there was a build up of phosphorous in the sediment and when the creatures died and sank into it the chemical structure was changed
6602376 switch and that did not work either however my syntax may be incorrect here too
6602377 she probably has another five years in there at most
6602378 lolita will remain at seaquarium surrounded by people who love and protect her
6602379 to define the named destinations at the correct place you first need to set the page layout to single page continuous works for displaying but not for defining then you resize the height of the window displaying your pdf inside acrobat not the acrobat main window so that it can display the place near the bottom of the page where you want the destination to be without jumping to the next page make sure you didnt scroll to that view but navigated there via keyboard keys or scroll bar otherwise acrobat wont catch the right position if you did scroll there click into the page once now create a named destination and link to it the link should now point to the correct position in continuous page layout too unfortunately this doesnt solve the problem entirely since text positioning and scroll raster dont allow for exactly the same distance from the top of the window to a given text you can work around this too by toying with the window size but that is a very annoying task
6602380 we have grant applications for projects in next season and i will also apply for more grants as they come available one as early as september so we can strive to have a steady stream of grant generated funds
6602381 a big misconception about grant monies is that there is a lot of it around and its easy to get in fact most of the funds available to performing arts organizations are focused and narrow in scope project specific and not applicable to operating expenses we will still need to continue to fundraise and offer educational programs to augment our coffers which we are geared up to do we will never be in this position again

6602386 by burning the garbage instead of putting it into landfill you reduce the methane mr sherger said
6602387 survival from cancer is now 13 percent higher than it was 15 years ago and rates continue to improve with advances in treatment and earlier detection ms stringer said
6602388 our increase in cancer knowledge is a direct result of research
6602389 events such as daffodil day are instrumental in raising the funds needed to support our life saving research ongoing investment in research is paramount if we are to continue making discoveries she said

6602397 police are convinced that trimming the branches will confine the four protestors to a single tree and will make it impossible for others to join the protest

6602403 how did you break out from being a local artist doing flyers in amsterdam to reach the level you are at today this art director literally picked a flyer i had done up off the street and tracked me down amsterdam is really small so he found me in a day back then everybody was into design and everything was nice and straight and i had done this weird flyer with hand written fonts so it stood out for that period he was looking for an illustrator to do a campaign for a sneaker store he dragged me in and that really gave me a push so i just started drawing more and more and began to be able to live off my work after i had a solo art show in london i got picked up by the agency big active and everything went easier from there
6602404 really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6602405 i read a lot of parts that i thought were essential

6602415 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win economic development institution building and the rule of law promoting internal reconciliation good governance providing basic services to the people training and equipping indigenous military and police forces strategic communications and more these along with security are essential ingredients for long term success
6602416 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
6602417 well wherever we go there is a real level of depression brought on by the added stress the drought has put on people
6602418 so thats quite hard to take actually its been quite a shock to the panel to hear the stories particularly the level of distress thats there
6602419 our rural communities arent dead but theyre on the way and certainly the family farm situation is at risk
6602420 a lot of places are being bought out by bigger places and corporates and if it continues to operate like this there will not be a family farm operation unless they are extremely large

6602423 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
6602424 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
6602425 once you get into the routine its really fun for a coach anyway youre doing football everyday your meals are regulated and youre on a real good schedule in some ways you dont look forward to the end of it
6602426 all youre doing all day is football of course the regular season is like that to a great degree also
6602427 st john fisher has just been tremendous to us and they are every year they do whatever they can to really make this the best training camp or as good a training camp as ive been around
6602428 the fans have been outstanding in their support and of course always have been its been good and well continue camp obviously back in orchard park right up until that last exhibition game ends and then well get into our regular season mode
6602429 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6602430 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again
6602431 many of us in the clinton camp hope that he would select sen clinton it would help bring parts of the democratic party together

6602441 the debt is selling right now because the bond market thinks the government is going to step in and take over
6602442 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6602443 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6602444 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6602445 we expect the total industry to soften for the second half of this year
6602446 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6602447 for example 911 centers will soon have to maintain handle and correlate domestic violence petitions for law enforcement who would have thought 911 centers would have to do that we have to hire people to do that
6602448 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices said john dingell a michigan democrat in the house of representatives
6602449 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader to acquire such a large oil inventory
6602450 the vitol groups net crude futures position on the main international exchanges on 6th of june was in fact short 11 million barrels said company spokeswoman victoria dix
6602451 this short position reflects the groups extensive use of the exchanges for managing price risk on the physical oil it supplies as is standard practice throughout the oil industry
6602452 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6602453 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6602454 the australian market for transport fuels and convenience retailing will continue to grow and caltex is well positioned to capture future market opportunities
6602455 refiner margins are expected to be volatile but remain robust overall
6602456 continued strength in diesel and jet fuel margins will likely compensate for the expected weakening in petrol demand
6602457 caltex recognised early in 2008 the possible negative impact of rising crude oil prices and reduced petrol demand caused by the us economic slowdown and took measures to respond to these challenges
6602458 sales of regular petrol eased in line with the overall market but caltex outstripped the market in growth of diesel jet fuel and higher margin premium petrol sales
6602459 lubricants sales volumes and margins increased as did margins for specialties
6602460 caltex remains committed to a conservative balance sheet and will continue its focus on good cash management
6602461 tenemos el bono de 240 d lares de reembolso por el uso de facturas de agroqu micos y fertilizantes tambi n creo en un tema muy importante que es la capacitaci n que reciben los agricultores por el uso de los qu micos y todo aquello que requieran
6602462 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6602463 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6602464 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6602465 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead
6602466 over 44 percent of the bankers reported that consumers as a result of higher energy prices were encouraged to shop locally slightly less than 12 percent disagreed with this linkage
6602467 performance share fees are volatile largely in line with absolute investment returns
6602468 performance share fees are earned in the calendar year and with half of that passed and with absolute performance for the first six months being minus nine per cent it is difficult to foresee given current market conditions any performance fees being earned for 2008 09
6602469 for an investment management company such as platinum to forecast earnings requires view of the future dependent on a number of unknown variables
6602470 additionally it requires us to fund flows for which we have no sound methodology on which to base a prediction
6602471 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
6602472 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewellers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms
6602473 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyones has seen for a long period of time
6602474 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of six per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6602475 what weve decided to do is to reduce the distribution payment policy to 75 per cent of operating income for the 08 09 financial year and well also change the frequency of the distributions as well to six monthly
6602476 so were going to retain 25 per cent of the earnings and they will go into long term and shareholders growth and obviously very sensible capital management
6602477 awe has completed the 2007 08 financial year in excellent financial shape and with a number of growth opportunities still ahead
6602478 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6602479 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6602480 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6602481 i should be home gettin my life together man up boy you are a disgrace to the state of la and that is hard to do go check yourself in at pineville with the other crazies go on the m amp m plan medicate and m sturbate
6602482 i think that in back of my mind i was hoping that one day i would feel well enough to see if the place was here
6602483 tighter regulation of the financial markets is almost certainly in the cards but reregulation could have unintended consequences bolstering the power of well organized interest groups reducing access to capital and undermining americas competitive position
6602484 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
6602485 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
6602486 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
6602487 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
6602488 especially at night it can be deeper than it looks
6602489 jobs were real hard to get in those days this was back in 1934 the depression was at a time when they were having a lot of trouble in san francisco a lot of union trouble with the stevedores union as i look back now i guess it was sort of a turning point in the economy of the whole bay area i didnt know it at the time but reading about it later those stevedores were only getting 50 cents an hour they went on strike harry bridges was their president they went on two strikes one in 1934 and another in 1936 the one in 1934 was real bad
6602490 being new in san francisco someone told me to go down to the waterfront to get a job helping unload ships i just had to go down and shop around because they
6602491 i was 21 years old and i hadnt had any experience with any labor difficulties so someone suggested i go down to the united fruit company in the china basin in san francisco so i inquired how to get there on the streetcar this was in an area around pier 50
6602492 i saw a bunch of men standing around so i went over
6602493 as soon as i told them they all gathered around me and started asking me questions i could see that something was wrong i didnt know exactly what
6602494 one fellow stepped up and he says do you think anything of your life
6602495 they the strikers saw this so here they come they jumped in a car and started over that way so i run and jumped on the first streetcar that came along i didnt know where it was going but they rode along beside the streetcar in their car this bunch of stevedores really had me surrounded and they were really a pretty tough looking bunch
6602496 two or three of them got on the street car and come over sat down beside me and started to talk to me i didnt tell them where i was staying or anything but they said i was going to be watched from then on and advised me to get out of the state i told them i didnt know if i would do that but i wouldnt be back down there anymore

6602500 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6602501 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6602502 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression in fact the study found that quality of life was actually lower in the women taking hormone therapy in the first few months of commencing treatment

6602510 secretary rice was scheduled to lead a delegation to the closing ceremonies of the olympics in beijing this coming weekend because of ongoing events around the world she is no longer going to be leading that delegation
6602511 through your political and national security committee your parliament and ramadan falls early this year what will you do if you cant get this done by december 31st
6602512 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6602513 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6602514 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6602515 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6602516 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will
6602517 we advise the arab leaders that iraq should return to the arab group the return of iraq is an essential goal
6602518 saad hariri the leader of lebanons parliamentary majority visited iraq last month lebanon named an ambassador to iraq two years ago but he died and a replacement has not yet been chosen there is an iraqi embassy in beirut the capital of lebanon
6602519 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6602520 we expect the total industry to soften for the second half of this year
6602521 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6602522 what weve said previously is that to cater for that well have to hire approximately 300 staff but unfortunately the action we have to take now is to manage the business in the interim
6602523 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6602524 what were seeing here is the legacy of neglect from the previous government
6602525 this industry has been left on automatic pilot pretty much since 2002

6602596 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost

6602643 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6602644 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters

6602716 not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
6602717 ask any agency principal what he or she dislikes and avoids the most and the answer will almost always be the same cold calling new business prospects not only is this the most dreaded activity among c level agency executives its also among the least effective cold calling has always produced only modest results and todays avoidance enabling technology only makes it easier for prospects to hide from your phone calls and ignore your e mails i routinely hear from agency principals how traditional new business prospecting methods are becoming less and less effective
6602718 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6602719 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6602720 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6602721 ever seen a atkinson movie lately it is pretty violent stuff
6602722 phils wife asked me yesterday to make sense of it all well i cant there is no sense to be made of this we just have to get through it one day at a time
6602723 the green olympics the peoples olympics and the hi tech olympics
6602724 yeah it was a good race full credit to the opposition
6602725 youd think it would be a popular sport in china
6602726 similar to beach volleyball they want the female competitors to wear skimpy shirts err skirts and probably skimpy shirts as well apparently now they wear dowdy polo shirts
6602727 which medal won by new zealands athletes at the beijing olympics rates as the more valuable metal
6602728 did you know that the distribution of olympic swimming medalists against the tropical astrological zodiac signs can be almost exactly mapped by a polynomial function of the third degree
6602729 as pleased as a primary school teacher who has just seen one of the kids take a tinkle in the lego box

6602736 we are expecting the sample to look similar to previous samples
6602737 one of the things well be looking for is an oxygen release indicative of perchlorate
6602738 while we are disappointed that nasa terminated our contract we believe in their process and support their decision we are pleased the gao has dismissed the protest we look forward to submitting a limited final proposal revision as required by nasa and to a timely contract award
6602739 we remain confident our offering will continue to be judged as the best value to the government our world class and highly experienced contractor team offered an innovative and comprehensive solution to develop and produce the next spacesuit for nasa we remain fully committed and prepared to meet all requirements of the constellation spacesuit program
6602740 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6602741 this is a major milestone event for inmarsat ils is proud to be a part of the construction of their global service with the successful proton launch of inmarsat 4 f3 today
6602742 congratulations to ils on another successful proton launch the f3 launch has been highly anticipated this satellite will enable inmarsat to complete its bgan services to subscribers across the globe
6602743 we thank ils for its due diligence in returning to flight successfully
6602744 its a bit of an art learning how to drive across dry lake beds at great speed
6602745 the good thing about having it attached to the truck is that if you miss the dust devil you can quickly pick up the instruments and chase it down again
6602746 but chasing just gives you more information about dust devils
6602747 the big thing about this project is were not just going in and measuring dust devils
6602748 we want to be measuring the ambient meteorology at the same time so having two different test areas gives us two different climatic regions to study
6602749 my clear favorites are the two tools that make the stis or space
6602750 we humans control the evolution of our tools and the goddard space flight center has stepped up the pace of that evolution for this last hubble repair mission we have created many tools to make never before repairs to instruments

6602765 staff are taking all necessary precautions including checking in with medical professionals
6602766 really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6602767 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat
6602768 its perfect affirmative action and because of all this guilt and the historic nature of things nobody had the guts to say well wait a minute do we really want to do this
6602769 i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy

6602772 unfortunately chris has advised the club that he did not want a send off or any farewell whilst he did agree to have a farewell on friday night he decided that it was not appropriate as the dogs were coming into a finals campaign
6602773 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
6602774 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake

6602777 i dont know what the problem with the apocryha is i think it is just as much part of the bible as some of the minor prophets
6602778 i think they milf are partly to blame really why this mindset of our government happened with all the violence that are happening
6602779 they should look at the problem internally as in any other ordinary simple organization maybe they should have some type of hierarchal discipline that should be one of the pre conditions i think
6602780 its impeachment one way to uncover truths and that is a constitutional process that maybe we should push
6602781 as whether this will succeed or not from what we have observed before and in the way the executive office is handling the congress i doubt it
6602782 the situation of the nation 25 years ago for which he gladly offered his life is not essentially different from what we have now credibility is low corruption is high poverty is widespread skepticism is deep
6602783 ninoy challenges us to make fidelity a prime value of our lives as filipinos it is the opposite of complacency and the enemy of mediocrity faithfulness refuses to cut corners as gold glows under fire and hammer so must we all take courage and stand up for what is right even if nobody will do it
6602784 we have been spending every day up in the little studio in our house trying to write music my favorite part so far is just seeing the guys every day and hanging out we have so much fun together the songwriting part is a bit slow on my part i think it has something to do with the baby in my belly but im sure it is all of the process and i really believe this could be the most inspired no doubt record so far cant wait to see what happens

6602787 obviously his strategists met on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use
6602788 seven months of job losses for americans seven houses for mccain
6602789 ive said this before i would never have my campaign engage in a concerted effort to make cindy mccain an issue and i would not expect the democratic national committee or people who were allied with me to do it
6602790 because essentially spouses are civilians they didnt sign up for this theyre supporting their spouse
6602791 i thought it was just going to be a couple of girls from the gym
6602792 im taking it one step at a time and enjoying the moment but its not out of the question
6602793 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
6602794 unfortunately with oil still nearly 50 higher than just six months ago we had to review the current structure and revise elements that will afford our ability to remain both customer friendly and cost conscious

6602797 the wave of patriotism hitting the airlines lately would be heart warming if not for the fact that all that seems to be motivating them is a desire to avoid any more bad pr
6602798 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
6602799 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers

6602803 whether any community should be expected to have examples of every architecutral period is not somethinng im convinced of cr hull said
6602804 i was amazed at how well it blended in and i was told by the mayor and staff at st kilda that the community are extremely happy with the building cr hull said

6602809 researchers are investigating potential solutions to this issue and will update customers as soon as we have more information to provide
6602810 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp stay silent only when telling the truth might get us fired or earn us a broken nose we need moral courage to be honest all the time
6602811 throughout the primary election we saw john mccain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics and this will not change as he prepares to run head to head against the democratic nominee
6602812 quadrennial republican scum festival that begins in august of every presidential election year
6602813 would rather lose a war that we are winning than lose an election
6602814 weve got two wars an energy crisis an economy teetering on the edge of real serious trouble and this is the campaign john mccain wants to run
6602815 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope

6602820 the first speaker was wearing glasses let us for the sake of argument say that a powerful microscope type lens replaced the glass on the right side of his spectacle the marxist speaker would then see with his right eye only electrons and subatomic particles moving at incredible speeds and the table the chairs people etc would vanish while with his left eye he would see no change what then would he say about illusion which eye of his was giving him the illusion
6602821 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6602822 will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution
6602823 furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure the government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6602824 why do we have such an elaborate chain with all living beings at the entire micro level to the macro level existing and ultimately perishing either as food for someone or by natural degeneration and death of the body due to age as applicable to each species
6602825 atulyaratna the indonesian youngman had held the audience in london spellbound with his story of the extraordinary change that came over the old man in surabaya
6602826 for a start according to the old man there are powerful centers on earth that control all living beings all humans at the time of death lose their bodily identity as well as the attributes of name and form to pass through
6602827 do you know or remember who you were when you died
6602828 physical movement which is a part of travel as understood by men and women with bodies is different from the awareness of travel that happened to me in my after death stage i just knew
6602829 it was a unique and a highly guarded secret meeting of eminent mystics of the world
6602830 what about their background did they indeed forget their strong sectarian hang ups
6602831 though born into hindu islamic jewish christian sikh jain buddhist zoroastrian or other traditions they had over the years evolved universally applicable thought processes and physical activities that had in their own wise way good heartedly countered the ritualism of theologically organized religions
6602832 please tell me about how the masses see the different sects and your own view of them
6602833 the mainly jewish kabbalah came into its own when the king of spain had banished its members strangely the sultan of turkey had given them shelter the yogis and mahatmas of india the ahl al haqiqah saints of sufi islam the ascended masters of the kabbalah the medicis and mystics of christianity the bodhisattvas of buddhist lore and many others like the munis of jainism were all rebels that were shunned by the priests and scholars they established the fact that erudition and intellectual brilliance do not always lead to divine experience or vision of the kingdom of god within oneself
6602834 great prophets and messiahs had gathered simple folk such as fishermen shepherds or farmers as disciples and gave them power and made them great whom did jesus choose into his inner circle not the intellectuals or the priests it was the same with buddha who had upali a barber leading the sangha mahavira and nanak had done likewise
6602835 tell me were you excited to be at the conclave with the grand masters and masters
6602836 i cannot even convey a hundredth of what i felt it was exhilarating to see the manner in which the masters set about the task instant and effective empowerment was sought to be implemented without considering the tradition the masters evolved themselves from hinduism islam christianity buddhism jainism and all other backgrounds held no importance a sufi saint would gladly empower a christian cabala priest to levitate a hindu mahatma would gladly empower a zoroastrian master to dematerialize and rematerialize to facilitate instant change of location for perhaps the first time since humans came into existence there was this phenomenal bonding of all spiritual masters for a common purpose of ensuring the well being of humanity and the world at the end of the day the most important aspect of the bonding was the creation of a super league of young intelligent men and women drawn from different backgrounds for countering the renegades the league had definite goals and the emphasis was on utilizing the right means with no trace of hatred except the highest degree of commitment to restore spiritual ideals and values back into the society to this end several contingents of young men and women members of the league were initiated by the grand masters into many supra human capabilities
6602837 such as the power to disappear and remain invisible the power to fly the power to immobilize a body or object from a distance the power to visualize a situation and read the minds of others at will and the power to create weapons instantly to be used against a person or object
6602838 i would say a lot is going to happen and the empowered men and women are set to transform the so called cleansers by their superior strategy of confronting and proving a few things
6602839 the utter uselessness of the cleansers temporal powers namely the power of money weapons or networking power
6602840 complete transformation of those who at this point in time oppose spirituality into convinced supporters of all that is spiritual
6602841 i would say less than a decade for us in the western hemisphere
6602842 however there is something sinister that the renegades are trying to do to discredit the spiritual masters
6602843 propagating stories of sexual misbehavior on trumped up charges or of corruption both very potent instruments to discredit the masters and grand masters and others men and women are being recruited as mercenaries on a grand scale for use as decoys and false accusers for this sinister purpose
6602844 the renegades are zeroing in on entry into kamandala the forbidden zone they have identified the procedure and the person that has the power to stop them they are trying to kill him or perhaps have killed him already
6602845 the renegades it appears have roped in a spiritual grand master of great power to help them
6602846 no one is prepared to reveal it is their top secret
6602847 it is so unfortunate history tells us of many such spiritual grand masters they fall prey to jealousy and egoism despite their exalted stature even the great buddha had to contend with his own cousin deavadatta that tried to get him killed
6602848 lets hope we will be able to get over the hassle
6602849 bravo you pulled it off all right i acknowledge you as a genius of our time now tell me as to how you had come up with this idea and about the next step
6602850 as you know i had come up with a theory that could explain the phenomenon of electrical dysfunction in respect of a terrestrial disturbance that occurred close to the location where the team was proceeding to at the time you remember i had said that i stumbled upon the theory that there could be a spot roughly around three to five kilometers in radius on the surface of the earth which could be running deep down to a central circular core area which may be termed the force center of all electrical impulses of planet earths mass molecular structure well its something like this the electrical forces of our planet earth are presently believed to be held in perfect balance thus producing no resultant reaction i had said that the electrical and nuclear forces in nature were enormously greater than the gravitational forces even so since these electrical and nuclear forces were both held in check by being in a state of perpetual and perfect balance the gravitational forces though comparatively much smaller were presently dominating the inter planetary force field system even a comparatively small force such as say the force produced by electro magnetic repulsion if it be of the required magnitude when applied at that particular electrical center of our planet earth could artificially create an electrical imbalance to trigger an enormous electrical reaction producing unknown quanta of energy this could perhaps even result in making the earth take off at great speed into space and run astray overcoming its own gravitation as well as the orbital influence of the pulls exerted by other planets of our solar system i had also said that this was bound to lead to unpredictable chaos and possible destruction on a colossal scale far exceeding that of any nuclear disaster robin was still skeptical and had countered ok doc now tell me for gods sake what do you really feel about all this is it just one of those crazy theoretical conjectures or is it in the realm of possibility however remote well im pretty certain i could be right it is an area that has not been explored up to now and needs deep study and experimentation including the simulation and application of these intended corrective charges electrical theory as now taught ignores these twisters and im pretty sure no one yet has an idea of the electrical center of the planet earth as even a remote possibility
6602851 we will have to build the worlds largest and most powerful charge generator and put it in the right place and start manipulation
6602852 you have seen me obtain repulsive reaction from instantaneous charges simultaneously applied circumventing the presently held theory that work needs to be done to introduce a polarized entity next to or near an electrical or electro magnetic body for which purpose the amount of work required to be expended is calculated on the basis of the field strength of that body the main sphere we are talking about namely the earth would be of a mind boggling potential field strength and this kind of calculation to place another body next to its electrical center would give the amount of work needed as something which would be far far beyond any human capability if we follow the traditional mode of calculation i have formulated my course of action based on the required work on the basis of adopting an instantaneous charging technique for both bodies simultaneously with identical quanta of charge thus producing a force of repulsion sufficient to destabilize the electrical balance of the main sphere and prepare it for finer manipulation once this is achieved there is no stopping of the enormous and mind boggling energies and force factors we could expect the world as we know it wouldnt be the same again
6602853 the main parts could be built in the u s and the others at other locations including some in india where it would be easy to maintain secrecy as no one would bother to know what goes on next door and also perhaps in japan
6602854 i will guide and instruct your man at every stage to erect the machinery i somehow visualize that the center that your man will identify under my guidance would be close to where we have installed the power plant with enough foresight
6602855 promise me that you will not hold anything back but will tell me what you know as i keep seeking answers
6602856 i promise as i said im not a nava sadhu and has no reason to mislead you
6602857 i consider you as my master and hope to experience truth whatever that may be
6602858 fine please go ahead let me make it clear that im going to convey to you what my master told me there will be nothing of my own in this
6602859 i believe all things and events including birth growth decline and death of humans are pre ordained do you know who pre ordains them
6602860 while there are as many theories as there are strands of hair on my head each is often claimed by its protagonists to have emanated from the supreme being
6602861 please go ahead while many such theories are proclaimed true by the faithful others the so called non believers pick flaws declaring their own to be true
6602862 my master says that the control mechanism of a living human which is called the individual frequency or consciousness is outside the persons physical body he visualizes this to be connected in some manner to the brain circuit at one end and to a matrix far away from it at the other this would explain he says of ones out of body experiences seeing ones own gross body from outside which happens when the brains connections to the individual consciousness and to the matrix undergo transformation a temporary removal of the ego and the memory bank of thoughts
6602863 the master said that death is nothing but an out of body experience of a longer duration of earth time a condition when the connection of the individual consciousness to the brain circuit is severed while its connection to the matrix remains death happens to all not only to the living entities but to particles of matter and all other substances in the universe without exception the only difference is the time frame of death reincarnation cycle which is different starting with a trillionth of a second for atoms or particles to billions of years to planets among those considered as living beings it could be a thousand years for a tortoise in this cycle man appears to be in the 100 to 150 year range death happens when a combination of influences make it happen we will come to that as we go along
6602864 unless a special condition arises when the individual consciousness is severed from both the brain circuit and the matrix resulting in non existence of that individual consciousness a human or for that matter any entity has rebirth
6602865 strongly believed that no human can ever know the truth which is in a dimension unknown to him or her and utterly impossible to fathom given the limitations of a humans potential to perceive through the triangle of sense organs intellect and intuition your master would certainly know that
6602866 hey permit me to go on with my masters concept the next major question is about this connection between the brain the individual consciousness and the so called matrix how are these connections made how are the connection between the brain and the so called individual consciousness maintained or severed how did the matrix happen and who or what made it happen you will be impressed by my masters answers whether right or wrong he is most consistent he says birth and growth are related to seed programming that selectively determines ones evolution the elements of male and female energy yin and yang of tibet and china known as shiva and shakti in india get activated when fertilization happens according to him the human body is an entity continuously connected through its porous transparency to various other bodies in the cosmos and is under their constant and continuous control and itself controls other bodies through a series of unique vibrations all bodies are inter dependent and their connection is through a medium not apparent or discernable by any human intellect or intuition the trigger or stimulating agent of consciousness of a living body or prana as mentioned in sanskrit lore is connected to the matrix of universality encompassing all consciousnesses the matrix particularly its core is called by different names by theorists one such being realm of god this matrix contains the male and female attributes that enter into each individual consciousness to control and sustain activity prana has within it chaitanya or liveliness which in simpler terms could relate to vibration all these taken together may enable the matrix to perform and hence they form its component parts
6602867 it seems pretty simple more like what we learn in science fiction
6602868 my master says that life is a miracle with living bodies floating in a continuous envelope of air and other gases which again are a conglomeration of elemental particles on our planet earth that is spinning and rotating at great speed with rays of energy entering and leaving through spaces and through pores of skins affecting each of the three main sheaths a living entity has such as the gross body of outer skin and other astral bodies that are in the realm of individual consciousness the entities unaware of this fact carry on merrily believing in physical attributes of shape form and environment
6602869 let me be quite frank i am very skeptical i somehow feel that all this as propounded by your master could be mere idle imagination within the limited parameters of a humans mental activity which is basically chemical in nature therefore i insist that the real thing cannot be and will never be known to your master or to you or me or to any human being
6602870 let me continue i contend that the master has defined the components of a workable system one cannot say the system is true since our capabilities and senses as humans are severely restricted and our vision is blemished to an extent that one may say that it is impossible to know the truth perhaps that is why the master says that we humans had to put in place concepts of a universal father or mother or a combination of both creating and ruling over their creation the idea was to make one believe that a father god or a mother goddess or a combination of both gods or other similar deity figures created this universe of all things seen and unseen and who at every millisecond or less of earth time monitor every sin we commit and love us and forgive us our sins provided we pray and sing their glory and live and act according to their commandments and follow the guidance so lovingly given by them over thousands of years through their angels prophets and messengers or by themselves directly taking birth on this unique planet called earth which as we all know is but a tiny and insignificant sphere shaped object in space one of many such objects that are like specs of dust or dots in a vast boundless cosmos this rather simplistic but widely held belief of the one god or many gods might ultimately turn out to be the absolute truth who are we to say yes or no the fact is that we humans cannot be sure of anything that lies beyond our capacity to perceive or understand the master said it could be that a very simple answer exists and that god could be a man like figure of immense power that controls everything in some mysterious way or perhaps we as part of the matrix ourselves create the world and sustain it by our free will
6602871 thank s the fact is that no human normally wants to make sacrifices to know the truth unless it is for his glory and for his unlimited happiness here and now or in another world of which he has no real knowledge except what has been given to him through channels he considers holy the human also wants to be free of pain physical disability poverty sexual impotence or infertility and illness apart from worry and stress all of which are the ills one encounters in life in this world anyone who removes his or her pain in a jiffy or removes ones stress or poverty or sexual malaise becomes a savior worthy of elevation to the status of a miracle performing super being and the religion or the path of action laid out by this super being or by his followers becomes a sacred belief to be nurtured and spread this commitment becomes so potent that one would be willing to kill those who oppose or contradict this sacred belief in any way it is a fact that a large percentage of people follow and fight for this or that religion more out of a strange fear rather than because of any conviction arrived through a process of self inquiry which may be the case with only an enlightened few says my master
6602872 i agree there is the fear of infamy fear of deprivation fear of being left out fear of so many other factors and the ultimate fear of punishment in a horrendous zone called hell for many life is a routine a continuation of ones family traditions beliefs and rituals providing a comfort zone already in existence at the time of ones birth and nurturing him or her till death however tell me more about the masters theory
6602873 my master asked me one day to imagine a person an earthling describing a scene so bizarre that in all probability i would attribute it to that persons hallucination or to a dream sequence of some unidentified origin my master went on to repeat to me the persons actual words as follows
6602874 what i saw was exceedingly strange and awe inspiring i do not know if it was a dream or if it was real i saw an enormous stretch of terrain between two huge distant snow capped mountain ranges there was no access through the mountain ranges making it impossible to reach there unless one flew over the glaciers i was there but did not know how i got there in this relatively vast flatland there was a huge area glowing with light one could notice an unending screen of light as long as the eye could focus apparently closing in on itself as it spread over to the left and to the right in all directions its vertical height seemingly disappearing into outer space millions of small dots crosses circles asterisks and other unfathomable symbols were flashing on to this unending screen at random they were going off the screen and reappearing at speeds that could be described as unimaginable by human intelligence positioned on lines passing through the center of this complex matrix of glowing color screens were rows of huge spatial cylinders each cylinder made up of clusters of colored sparks that shone like diamonds rubies sapphires emeralds and other gems of rare brilliance these cylinders of light that seemingly disappeared into the sky were constantly rotating on their axes at considerable speeds flashing symbols on to the screens all around the whole scenario was inconceivably bizarre and mind blowing
6602875 the master said he spoke to the person who saw or dreamed up the above scene he said he spoke slowly and clearly
6602876 im glad you saw this mind blowing spectacle which is beyond description by words known to you or me or to any fellow human i say that there is a logical explanation of what you saw what you saw was one of the control centers of human life which for some reason is separated from the life of all other species there are such control centers at inaccessible physical locations in certain parts of the earth and on other planets as well it is a self contained system that is similar to an administrative hierarchy as we know it controlled by a number of main cores of the matrix each responsible to monitor one of the directions for ensuring the working of the total system each symbol has a role to play in controlling the activity of one single human and in registering continuously on the screen at a dedicated space every action from the first breath at birth to the last breath at death monitoring all activity recording merit demerit and the resultant gain or loss of the glow factor specific to that human the control center is constantly bombarded with sparks of light from planets and spheres around its axes hitting the glow spots of each individual symbol methodically affecting the glow quotient which in turn adjusts the individuals action at all times throughout life because of its connection to the individual consciousness of the person in other words planetary influence is also a factor
6602877 the master said that the person was keen to know who created the matrix configurations the master had to explain thus
6602878 the core of each matrix is a part of the universal consciousness or the supreme being capable of drawing unto it all the loose and floating individual consciousnesses under the divine laws of relationships between the individual and the universal consciousness
6602879 i am speechless i now realize that we you and i are actually physically in sight of the matrix how did we get here is this what the supreme power is all about is it so easy to de materialize and re materialize our physical atoms what is destiny who decides it who programs the minds of sentient beings questions aplenty indeed i know i also know that you will provide me the answers in a manner that will make me understand and that you will later safely get me out of here even though it matters little whether or not i get out once i know the secret of these things
6602880 just remember that you have forced me by your genuine quest to bring you here it is a great risk i have taken and i may have to pay for it in the only way i know yet i promise to show you the ultimate secret as i know it and i shall do so come what may however ive to first put you through a long story covering many years you have to carefully visualize the scenes you will then understand how i finally got here for the first time quite recently just a few earth years ago there are many other masters and grand masters that will figure in it the fact as to how i came to acquire the crucial knowledge to reach this secret place is a story that starts with the yacht named la solaris which your father had owned you are now empowered to see the things as they happened by looking at the time continuum
6602881 any discussion on spirituality has to take off from a point that shows that it is some thing that is capable of being felt or experienced for a start it could be a traditional belief about inner space named the kingdom of god that is within us as declared by jesus if you have faith in jesus you will naturally consider this to be true and all further action to explore that kingdom becomes easy as you have no doubt about its presence within you it does not matter to you whether this inner space is there or not in other humans or in non human species inhabiting our world
6602882 what about god and our concept of him or her
6602883 our himalayan seers from the east declare that one can experience god when ones ego is obliterated leading to a merger of ones self with the universal self which is called god the self becoming a sub part of that god
6602884 what about those god men who though illiterate and or uneducated had risen to the very pinnacle of spiritual greatness without ever studying the scriptures or philosophy
6602885 it is a very valid question man is only said to be discovering whatever there already is and knowledge is one of the things that already exist and can be tapped into by anyone who through his mind attains a state of receptivity it then becomes a matter of switching the brain to the right frequency that could be done either by meditation or by some other technique these great men perhaps know an alternate way of switching
6602886 sister uma may i request you to please join me here
6602887 it will be an honor far beyond what i deserve
6602888 sister uma is a person that has attained a position in the realm of spirituality that you may call mind blowing
6602889 please explain to them the meaning of de materialization of the five sheathed human body
6602890 i am indeed grateful to the master for his kind words of introduction i owe my spiritual progress to the masters kind guidance and instruction let me now give you an over view of what the human body comprises of ones gross body sheathed in skin is the form with a given name that one normally identifies with his or her personality the fact is that this gross body is called as the food nurtured sheath there are four other finer and subtler sheaths that shroud the body which are called the mind nurtured sheath the life nurtured sheath the mind nurtured sheath the knowledge nurtured sheath and finally the joy or bliss nurtured sheath sometimes two or three of the sheaths are considered as one namely the mind life and the knowledge related ones thus reducing the sheaths to three they are not visible to the human eye yoga teaches us the way to access these sheaths to transport one to wherever one wishes in one of these sheaths each sheath has a corresponding mind stuff that comes into play as we access the sheaths
6602891 how does the mind work as one goes into meditation does one experience each of these minds associated with the five sheaths one after the other
6602892 yes indeed that is the purpose of their presence as one progresses away from the first mind associated with the gross body the other minds take over at each stage and the final stage is bliss or ananda a person returns to the gross mind when the bliss stage is consciously ended
6602893 the scientists tell us that we humans normally use only a very little portion of our brain
6602894 let us prepare our minds to accept a fact that defies physical laws as we understand them uma wanted to show us as to how it is possible for one to de materialize ones body stuff to disappear from view uma is very much here but in a different dimension from the dimension in which we exist she cannot communicate with any of us except through the mind she has the power however to create whatever she wishes in our dimension before materializing herself back to be with us
6602895 i know how unreal all this will look to most of you the master is yet to reveal some other important detail about my disappearance i now request him to speak to us about it
6602896 uma is right there are various ways in which true yogis can act if they wish to physical disappearance is the first and basic act of leaving our dimension as demonstrated by sister uma a yogi who attains the power called swa drisya can stay in his body while at the same time manifest himself in any manner or form in a place of his choice using one of the sheaths other than his food nurtured sheath namely his body he can then be in more than one place at any given time
6602897 more speed and quickness generally than weve had in the past and i think the skill level is maybe a litle bit higher
6602898 i like this job and i am grateful for this job
6602899 i knew from the start this would be a bumpy road
6602900 you dont know how youll feel about moving away from your family until you actually do it
6602901 i thought it would be more comfortable for me to be closer to them and that is why i am leaving

6602905 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
6602906 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6602907 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6602908 did you expect to do a whole pregnancy without putting on any weight
6602909 its funny everybody else loses weight breastfeeding but i havent at all
6602910 do you know it actually upsets production of the enzyme that regulates appetite
6602911 a second violation would be if the gall was marketed on the black market
6602912 we were the first ones on foot close enough to see what was going on
6602913 he was lying flat on his back as if he was on an operating table
6602914 right now its a needle in a haystack because we dont have any witnesses or vehicle description
6602915 yes hes behind even if hes 10 points ahead thats like being behind hes the underdog insurgent and john mccain is the press adored topdog establishment candidate
6602916 and giordano is completely correct that in terms of groundgame and turnout and new voters the perception of a close race will help your actual numbers far more than the perception that your guy has it sewn up even if you stay home
6602917 ive come to a place in my life where there are songs that want to be written
6602918 and that i really want to sing we didnt think the record would be ready until next year but the music weve been making is so inspiring weve been on a real creative jag
6602919 i mean if you believe the fuel and wast cant safely be transported then you pretty much want to rule out the use of nuclear energy
6602920 the field can now report based on an unnamed source
6602921 he was claiming there was the cardoza 40 40 clinton delegates who were going to en masse jump to obama in may of this year never happened
6602922 ideally what you want as a candidate is to stay slightly behind your opponent until what two weeks out or so and then snuff him at the last minute
6602923 also at this point in the election in 1992 clinton was ahead by 20 points so if al wants to come up with one hypothetical to make his point we can find another hypothetical to show he isnt right
6602924 on what issue is hilary so perfect and obama so egregiously wrong that a mccain presidency would be preferable
6602925 do we still have work to do with folks who supported hillary clinton absolutely but weve been able to make great strides
6602926 theyve already voted once against barack obama and right now after three months of 20 20 hindsight theyre still not voting for barack obama
6602927 i support the things she is working for as a politician
6602928 who are white and whose answers to at least two questions suggest that race is important to them the vast majority of these people are reliable republicans in the mccain camp he said
6602929 hillary has the same number of years in elected office as obama
6602930 in fact in my political memory i cant recall having a serious discussion about the merits of a candidates
6602931 bottom line is that hillary is widely perceived as meeting the experience threshold josh whether you or i might agree with that or not were talking about what motivates other people after all not what motivates us
6602932 if x seems to be a good move cant we also play it in student ys line
6602933 i like this position better than the one we had before because moves g and h are included
6602934 i just try to get a little bit better each time
6602935 i love the fact that it is a never ending puzzle there is always something more to learn even in this camp people have found things that caused my jaw to drop we are not even close to solving chesss mysteries despite computers i also love that chess is a pure meritocracy its pretty cool that in this day and age a seventeen year old is fifth in the world there are few areas where a seventeen year old can beat a forty year old
6602936 going in i was white in a grunfeld and ftacnik has written books on this opening going in i had some preparation but i didnt know precisely which line he played i am happy with the game because i felt my play was very positional accurate at some point he made a mistake and allowed me an interesting exchange sac although i think by that time i was already somewhat better so i had an endgame with two bishops and a rook against two rooks and a bishop but i also had a secure passed pawn on a6 and was able to win its probably the only game i ever played where i felt like i really outplayed a gm
6602937 not letting them just sit back and do what they want
6602938 it was in the new jersey futurity last year and was my first win against a grandmaster i built up a good attack my opponent wasnt necessarily worse but the position was very unclear and he couldnt figure out how to solve all of the problems i set for him the game finished with a nice tactical blow
6602939 before this i had not had good results against ims
6602940 but these wins marked a new level for my chess
6602941 but i dont see chess as a profession i do think however that i will always play
6602942 its a beautiful game with so many possibilities i love the thrill of playing not necessarily winning but the thrill of competition i also play a lot of sports but the feeling of competition is different there perhaps because chess is a mental game
6602943 tennis is a very strategic game sometimes you play one way and it isnt working so you have to adapt change your strategy find your opponents weakness also like chess you have to work very hard to improve at tennis
6602944 i like the philosophical questions science fiction raises and the different ways of viewing the world it can suggest
6602945 but i like positions where i have at least some counterplay i prefer when i have a clear plan but can set my opponent some difficult choices
6602946 gets a lot of satisfaction from playing to the best of my ability
6602947 i definitely play for like a hobby but before tournaments i try to study at least an hour a day i do think i will play chess all my life but im not sure ill study all my life i wont try to be a chess professional
6602948 if you are playing a really big game in the last round the feeling of adrenalin and focusing to achieve a result is very cool it can be also very relaxing sometimes if you are stressed out its like a release of emotion it helps you chill
6602949 yeah of course what i really hate is that so many people immediately assume girls suck even when im on top board people always think im the lower rated player i remember one experience visiting a chess club in san diego and everyone immediately presumed i was a beginner my first opponent barely even looked at the board when he played me he talked to other people read the newspaper
6602950 but only because he wasnt paying attention though right if he had been he would have crushed you easily
6602951 in my game against shabalov i checkmated a very strong player whom i have a lot of respect for the erenburg game was completely opposite a positional crunch
6602952 it came to me when playing that the conventional plan of f4 f5 g4 g5 g6 in the kings indian attack is very different when black has fianchettoed his king bishop i understood then that i should play h4 h5 which both saves time and keeps the g4 square open for the white queen
6602953 because of all the girls obviously no seriously i like to attack people and rip their kings apart
6602954 ill maneuver around for a while and then about move 35 when i have six minutes and my opponent has three ill open the position up and hope for the best i think its important to stay about three minutes ahead on the clock
6602955 spent a lot of time working on chess with my partners in crime josh friedel david pruess and vinay bhat
6602956 i want to conquer the world no seriously i want to improve myself both as a player and a person
6602957 perhaps just i want to be less outwardly competitive since being competitive is an important part of who i am as a person but ive definitely been working on this lately
6602958 the world has so many problems global warming the oil crisis pollution poverty these are so much bigger than chess and i want to do my part to help
6602959 actually id like to be a spy id have the perfect cover i could travel around playing in chess tournaments id be one of the top players who would suspect me
6602960 except i guess if the people i was spying on knew how to use google then theyd read this interview and figure it out
6602961 even when i get worse or losing positions i never give up ive won an amazing number of lost positions because i set a lot of obstacles for my opponents
6602962 partially im too lazy to study them but i also do think that kids get fewer endgames than other people
6602963 people seem to assume that kids are good at tactics but i dont think thats always the case
6602964 when you win everything else in the world seems unimportant for about ten minutes
6602965 i dont really think i hate losing that much ive had a couple bad losses but i get over it losing is not a disaster for me
6602966 it was a sharp opening very tense and then i sacked a pawn for an attack i felt like i had really great pressure throughout i won nicely in the end but he only made one mistake the entire game
6602967 id like to make international master although i dont know if thats possible before college
6602968 it was an up and down game plus it was high stakes with a win either of us would have taken a big lead in the tournament
6602969 i went in trying to win each game i was up a pawn for nothing in one game but in the others i didnt have much of a chance before the match i would have thought id do better but now i would expect to score only about 95 against joel although id think id do better in 3 0 and probably id do better on icc also because i could pre move
6602970 in tactical games you can get overwhelmed theyre just riskier one mistake in a tactical game and youre dead
6602971 i know tactics are very helpful ive found if i do tactics before tournaments i do really well
6602972 i dont see myself as a chess professional but i think i will play chess for most of my life school is also very important to me id like to be like vinay bhat he didnt focus on chess much while he was in school but now he has a good job and is also a gm
6602973 i wasnt expecting to do so well i didnt think i could compete with players like daniel yeager who was rated 2350 and tyler hughes who id heard was very underrated but when i tied for first i realized for the first time how well i could actually play i started off 3 0 beating yeager this inspired me and allowed me to be myself when i was playing the remaining games not doing anything crazy or playing scared like ive done before when playing up
6602974 daniel was rated a hundred points higher than me and the game was complicated i had to make a lot of decisions in one key position i had won a pawn and both queens were attacked yeager then used his queen to take my bishop so then i had a pawn for a bishop i had two options one i could take a piece and equalize material but he would have all the play my other choice was to accept a rook and pawn for two pieces it was extremely complicated i looked at a couple lines and they seemed ok but i couldnt figure the whole thing out still i felt i had to go for it daniel ended up making a critical error i managed to whip up a decisive attack and ended up winning nicely
6602975 when you solve puzzles you only focus on two skills calculation and planning but games show you many more general ideas for example in one of daniel yeagers games that we analyzed he had a serious space disadvantage and consequently his pieces were not so good i kept trying to find ways for him to play actively but couldnt make anything work benjamin showed us that sometimes you have to accept a structural disadvantage in exchange for activity i really learned a lot from that in addition benjamin focuses a lot on openings and its allowed me to see how complex opening ideas can be
6602976 you practice in similar ways training specific skills but in basketball the skills are even more specific than in chess when you practice tactics youre never doing it with the expectation that you will get exactly that position but shooting free throws its pretty much the same each time
6602977 i dont think for me in either sport its about being competitive as much as it is about loving the game when i love something i want to do it well
6602978 so yes glenn this type of progress in the racial realm is not easy you wanted a guarantee that it would be painless of course a black presidential candidate will bring out some ugly stuff but thats a feature not a bug
6602979 so i wont bother arguing that a denzel or a tiger is neither a ball player
6602980 the problem is that the original story was that mccain stole it from solzhenitsyn and then it was debunked and that solzhenitsyn never said such a thing
6602981 if you want to start throwing down with the geekery you need to talk about chainmail and empire of the petal throne or tell us what gurps really stands for
6602982 solzhenitsyn never said that and heres his biographer proving it
6602983 now that d amp d players everywhere have been avenged can we get back to the inconvenient fact that the people who are attacking mccains cross story are simply political hacks who have no evidence or reason to call the story into question
6602984 ive got a box full of medals that demonstrate my service to my country what have you done besides being a street agitator in chicago
6602985 while you were smoking dope on waikiki i was serving my country in the navy you havent earned the right to run for president
6602986 to be fair its not quite as useful for mccain to lay the hammer on someone who doesnt want endless war
6602987 dont worry though mccain is too classy to drop the hammer on obama like that
6602988 to one up the nerdiness of you id disagree that the horde is necessarily the bad guys the allies certainly have done their fair share of evil over time
6602989 mccain is just like you and obama is a liberal elitist
6602990 my approach to gun control is that you control your gun and ill control my gun
6602991 do you want to vote for someone who cant even remember how many homes he owns
6602992 do you want to vote for someone who owns expensive shoes
6602993 the obamas 4 million they made it the old fashioned way they earned it
6602994 more you scratch my back and ill scratch yours with the publics money sorry middle america i hope your back doesnt itch
6602995 i know that as a consequence of my fund raising i became more like the wealthy donors i met in the very particular sense that i spent more of my time above the fray outside the world of immediate hunger disappointment fear irrationality and frequent hardship of 99 percent of the population that is the very people that id entered public life to serve the longer you are a senator the narrower the scope of your interactions you may fight it with town hall meetings and listening tours and stops by the old neighborhood but your schedule dictates that you move in a different orbit than the people you represent
6602996 obama is only a few points ahead which is the same as losing can he come from behind or will mccain cruise to victory
6602997 a move so brilliant the candidate moves up 10 points in the polls
6602998 a move so idiotic the candidate moves down 5 points in the polls while the other guy manages not to screw up
6602999 uhm maybe your just on some captain save a ho shit
6603000 whats the deal with you hitting on chicks in relationships
6603001 man have you ever noticed how different men and women get treated for doing the same things and its like i notice it happening all over the place now whats the deal with that maybe we should i dont know do something about it
6603002 the shallowness of men is yawn inducing the shallowness of women is a national crisis
6603003 they want to be the bad boys to some extent to cut loose be irresponsible take risks and stop worrying about what everybody else thinks
6603004 i was nice to you why wont you put out
6603005 we need a woman for president but not that woman
6603006 sebelius no because if hes decided to go with a woman why not hillary
6603007 i love the distinction between hillaryism and feminism i never saw hillary as much of a feminist she has remained in an abusive marriage with her philandering husband for decades and whatever power she had in her life until she was elected to the senate was directly derived from being a beneficiary of the white male patriarchy i just dont see her as an icon of feminism hillaryism on the other hand is completely about the promotion of hillary
6603008 id love to see a woman president just not hillary clinton
6603009 id love to see a black president just not obama
6603010 id love to see a woman president just not hillary clinton
6603011 id love to see a black president just not obama
6603012 for a certain subset of hillary supporters middle aged women this is the ultimate sin
6603013 first her personal life is her business many feminists have made choices about men in their lives that are similar sometimes regrettably and sometimes not so feminism is not about women leaving men
6603014 second you claim hillary clinton is all about the promotion of herself yes she is that is feminism especially in politics how do elections work there is one winner how do you win you promote yourself
6603015 too eager to prove shes not afraid to use force
6603016 i notice you skipped over janet napolitano jeanne shaheen christine gregoire barbara boxer barbara mikulski etc there are plenty of female democratic governors and congresscritters who are smart and capable women in their own right
6603017 the entrance of women to the u s congress the widow effect
6603018 id love to see a woman president just not hillary clinton
6603019 id love to see a black president just not obama
6603020 but when do we ever dismiss male politicians because they werent
6603021 id love to see a woman in position x a woman has never held but i dont like sarah palin nancy pelosi libby dole hillary clinton s policies so id prefer the other candidate
6603022 shes a woman you 20 and 30 somethings isnt that enough
6603023 and when i say id love a woman but not hillary i mean that a her two instances of executive experience health care and managing this campaign are negative endorsements
6603024 however i think to non feminist hrc primary supporters especially white men in swing states a pick of sebelius will be disaster i think a woman not named hillary clinton will appear like affirmative action to a white male swing voter living in ohio or pennsylvania
6603025 please spare us your armchair psychology joe i am glad you understand women voters so well
6603026 my problem is that hillary clinton is held to a double standard
6603027 i consider myself a strong feminist and i really dont understand the support of hillary just because she is a woman i thought feminism was supposed to free us from gender bias
6603028 this management stuff is hidden sexism its reaching for a reason not to vote for her because you dont want to and cant figure out why or how
6603029 you couldnt see the knife it just looked like he punched him
6603030 he just likes to hang out and get his rent paid
6603031 nahnah bro you go too far by a mile on this one rc belongs in the same over hyped underachieving class as ryan leaf
6603032 1 it is a shame vick is such an idiot he had even more potential a combination of sanders and marino and even less expression of that potential
6603033 the perfect counterpoint to that look of exasperation from carl banks after randall denies him the sack in that super human move is the clip of lawrence taylor who was miked for nfl films at the time sitting on top of randall after a play shaking his head and saying
6603034 i think that when i first started working with bill walsh
6603035 it was a pleasant surprise for him that i was ahead of the game for a rookie
6603036 then he said if you see something thats not in the plan do it anyway always remember to do something against the trend against the down and distance conditions youll be surprised how successful youll be because everyones always working off tendencies
6603037 everything he did was based on setting someone up for future meetings hed hold stuff back hed go against tendencies i loved his system
6603038 his philosophy was based on stretching the field which would force the linebackers deeper and open things up underneath
6603039 it was never a take what they give us philosophy it was make them take what we give them and it gave me a feeling of invincibility i felt i could make any throw he wanted me to make
6603040 it would have started with the deep strike and everything would have played off that it would have set records that never would be broken
6603041 but those things brains accuracy can be learned and improved with time so i think he had the potential to have been great quite possibly better and more explosive than either of them obviously he didnt take that advantage so this is purely speculation and well never know
6603042 rc is an early example of black players who insist on being a qbs despite being manifestly better suited to rb all because of an ancient prejudice against black qbs its a counterproductive cultural imperative
6603043 unfortunately intelligence seems to be required to be a really good quarterback and vick doesnt seem to have ever had much of it

6603088 i have watch pickens commercials and interviews on cnbc and c span for weeks urging americans to support his energy plan on his website pickens has created a social network where the goal is to get a million members
6603089 i like the energy plan that pickens wants us to support and i want to support it i noticed however that over 90 of the members are of caucasian descent as a professional african american and partner of a marketing agency where most of our clients use us to reach the high end urban and african american professional i wanted to volunteer our agency services to increase the awareness of pickens energy plan within the high end urban and african american community

6603144 the performances are naturalistic with emphasis given to believability of character as opposed to showiness of acting
6603145 the film is shot largely in handheld super 35mm to both give a documentary feel to the story allowing the audience to inhabit more closely the dilemmas faced by the characters and also to take full advantage of the extraordinary widescreen panorama that is rwanda
6603146 the production cameras are usually hand held lights kept to a minimum
6603147 as 70 of the story takes place in the school compound it was a privilege to be able to film at the school where genocide took place as it lends a remarkable integrity to the film
6603148 x2 roles are aaron stanford as fire manipulator pyro and daniel cudmore as colossus who can change his flesh into organic steel
6603149 itll get you worked up and it should it has an intriguing hook that gets you involved immediately and emotionally with the characters
6603150 its an issue ive struggled with my entire life when i was a child i felt that if only i could change myself my life would be better as ive gotten older ive come to terms with what utter nonsense that is and this movie adds light to that dark subject
6603151 magneto says to his followers nobody is going to cure us we are the cure
6603152 its abhorrent to me as it would be if a person said i need curing of my sexuality or if someone said that black people could take a pill that would cure them of being black
6603153 look at rogue for example her abilities to absorb the powers of other mutants which can result in death are amazing yet she lives a very lonely life she can never touch anyone have a physical relationship or have children as politically abhorrent as the cure is its also understandable that someone like her would consider taking it
6603154 so its not surprising that he may explore however briefly the idea of being a regular guy he realizes of course that being regular is not his destiny hes a very brave soul because true bravery means seizing your fate and doing good with it and thats exactly what beast does
6603155 nobody had really tried to bring a significant level of emotion to comics before the x men comics in the seventies
6603156 we owed it to the franchise to recapture that kind of strong emotion the only way to do that is to make the audience feel that this universe is real to let them know that both good and bad things can happen
6603157 one of the most important things about the comics was that readers became emotionally attached to the characters from issue to issue they didnt come back just for the stories they returned for the characters
6603158 bryan singers x men films were a blueprint for me
6603159 i wanted to maintain the tone and story arcs that bryan and the actors had created the audiences care about these characters and it was important to me to stay true to who they are my goal was to take what worked in the first two films but make it more emotional and resolve some character arcs
6603160 brett is respectful of and staying true to the vision of x men and x2 but at the same time hes taking the franchise to a new level adding more emotion and deepening the relationships
6603161 hes really been a supporter of finding a consistent voice for storm it wasnt about giving me more dialogue but when im onscreen i want it to matter
6603162 in the first two films wolverine debated joining the x men or staying true to his nature and remaining a loner in x men the last stand the question becomes more of whether he will play a leadership role in the x men it makes the stakes much higher which was essential because my feeling is if youre going to reprise a role you want to do it better and take it further this film allowed me to do that
6603163 i wanted to give the x men interesting personalities and make them empathetic and believable
6603164 when we started marvel we always tried to get characters that were relatable they had to seem like real people even though they had incredible powers we thought that extra depth was important
6603165 that someday these little stories we were doing could become such magnificent movies
6603166 it was key to the story and character relationships and important to the fans who love these films
6603167 all these actors coming back says a lot about their love of the script and the x men films
6603168 the cast made these movies what they are and it was critical to get them back for this film
6603169 what jean does in this film is very different from what she does in the first two films
6603170 its a big change that comics fans have long been anticipating and which the films audiences will be shocked by
6603171 in the first films there are inklings that something is wrong with jean moments where her powers seem more than she can handle
6603172 this is taken further in x2 in which shes having headaches and difficulties in controlling her powers
6603173 hes lost his focus in life the person he loved the most
6603174 the meaning of the x men what they stand for has lost its value to him now that jean is gone in fact the whole team is suffering
6603175 she can either be cured and change her life forever or accept who she is and continue living with the feelings of isolation that accompany her mutation
6603176 rogue has the worst power in the entire mutant universe period
6603177 she cant touch or express love what is she going to do this film answers the question
6603178 bobbys powers to radiate intense cold come into their own just as he faces major challenges in his relationship with rogue
6603179 things get even more complicated when he starts to feel a connection with kitty pryde a young mutant who can phase through solid matter played by ellen page he is ready to become a full member of the x men
6603180 my character has become magnetos right hand man more confident in his powers and more powerful and capable of inflicting major damage
6603181 but shes about to get a hard lesson in the strength of his outrage over the cure and hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
6603182 everyone had ideas as to who should play the role
6603183 the most difficult thing about beast wasnt writing the character but casting it to me the great casting genius of the film is kelsey grammer he inhabits beast with his voice demeanor physicality and eyes
6603184 and hes very slow to fight but when he does fight he is magnificent so i thought okay id like to play that
6603185 when i signed on for the job i realized that i would be doing my first full prosthetic foray and i must say i had mixed emotions
6603186 its very effective in playing the character and at the same time its a bit stilting you have to work a bit harder to get that mask to take on some of your energy on the plus side the prosthetic has helped me realize the dynamic power of stillness in a performance i made a decision to not bring in too much facial energy and instead to rely more on my eyes its through his eyes that we see beasts intellect shine
6603187 there are five pieces that comprise beasts head theres a neck the skullcap with ears one big piece for the cheeks and jaw the forehead and the lower lip then theres the body suit gloves and feet and six hairpieces the nature of the character required the makeup to be very flexible
6603188 angels actions point out how much young people want to fit in to be liked and to be like everyone else
6603189 in a way it sums up what the x men are all about that we all feel like were different and that the only course is to accept those differences if we dont the results can be ruinous
6603190 we had to design angels clothes to accommodate three different versions of his wings
6603191 one set is to accommodate prosthetic wings that are attached to his back in scenes where he appears bare chested another set is for his closed wings that are attached to a harness which have to fit over the wings and conceal them a third normal set of clothes is for use when the wings are entirely computer generated
6603192 hes a member of the brotherhood but doesnt necessarily share magnetos intense interest in abolishing the cure he just lives for battles
6603193 wolverines fighting style in the first two films was great but for the new film we wanted to explore the comics fighting style
6603194 most of the time wolverines fighting only for wolverine here hes fighting for something bigger and therefore he fights harder fiercer were going to see a wolverine whos really angry
6603195 in x men and x2 my fighting style was slicing and dicing but for this film i wanted to go back to the comics which had brilliantly conceived fight scenes
6603196 i know it seems like a little thing but ive been saying since the first movie i just want to fly
6603197 its such a spectacular stunt that nobodys going to believe halle did it but she did
6603198 the golden gate bridge sequence is magneto at his most intense
6603199 its been attempted before in short doses on other films but we used it for the first four minutes of the movie what weve done is take professor x and magneto back 20 years in time and make them younger
6603200 the final effect is that everything looks natural and beautiful
6603201 what happens in the movie is fantastic so i felt and brett ratner agreed that the sets should be grounded in reality
6603202 we wanted to stay true to the look of the two earlier x men movies
6603203 the mandate is that were in a world thats already been established but we want to embellish on that look make it more interesting and compelling were aided in this by the story arc which ultimately leads us to a sort of apocalyptic landscape
6603204 its not about religion but about a relationship with the god

6603246 its definitely something that we think about all the time

6603521 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore

6603576 why should a bunch of atoms have thinking ability why should i even as i write now be able to reflect on what i am doing and why should you even as you read now be able to ponder my points agreeing or disagreeing no one seems to have any answer to this the point is that there is no scientific answer

6603582 how can mere matter originate consciousness consciousness seems like a radical novelty in the universe not prefigured by the aftereffects of the big bang so how did it contrive to spring into being from what preceded it

6603661 the initiative opens up a range of substantial policy options for the government to energise the teaching profession to reward the most outstanding practitioners and keep them in the profession
6603662 the first step is to make sure we can recognise the best teachers who improve student learning
6603663 to make sure that schools and school systems can begin to consider the methods of ensuring that these teachers are appropriately rewarded
6603664 were having a broad ranging discussion with a lot of people out there were doing our own modelling we will be looking seriously at their work

6603703 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6603704 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more

6603724 if there are malaysians who want to take up the idea that came from the pro opposition blogger they are insulting this important national symbol flag
6603725 its all in the blog only he can do a good job hes simply creating trouble by coming up with dubious stories
6603726 it is internationally accepted that raising the flag upside down is a mark of a state in distress it is never a mark of disrespect

6603737 la sciocca e inutile trovata di rilevare le impronte digitali ai bambini rom
6603738 poniamo che arrestino un tizio uno sconosciuto che non e vip e non ha amici vip con laccusa di aver rubato 6 milioni di euro alla collettivita rapinando una banca o rubando nelle ville e che poi lo scarcerino dopo 28 giorni giornali e tg sarebbero pieni di commenti indignati di politici e opinionisti contro lennesima scarcerazione facile rubo 6 milioni gia a casa la polizia li mette dentro i giudici li mettono fuori alfano ispettori contro le toghe buoniste pdl e pd uniti tolleranza zero contro ladri e rapinatori difficilmente a qualcuno verrebbe in mente che il tizio e solo un sospetto rapinatore e che in italia vige la presunzione di non colpevolezza poniamo invece che il tizio accusato di aver sottratto 6 milioni al prossimo sia un politico sospettato di mazzette sulla sanita piu precisamente un governatore magari dellabruzzo ieri ha ottenuto i domiciliari dopo 28 giorni di carcere per cessato pericolo di inquinamento probatorio ma non di reiterazione del reato a nessuno e venuto in mente di gridare alla scarcerazione facile di protestare perche e uscito dopo appena 28 giorni anzi qui facili erano le manette quei 28 giorni sono parsi eccessivi a chiunque si sia espresso sul caso parve eccessivo anche il primo giorno di custodia tante che un minuto dopo lo scattare delle manette era gia tutto un coro era proprio necessario arrestarlo eppure per la costituzione e la legge tra il tizio e del turco non ce alcuna differenza entrambi sono sospettati di aver derubato la cittadinanza della stessa somma entrambi devono restare in cella per un po onde evitare che concordino versioni di comodo con testimoni e coindagati possibile allora che politici e media li trattino in modi cosi diversi anzi opposti lunica spiegazione e il razzismo sociale che e venuto montando in italia creando una costituzione materiale che ritiene intoccabili a prescindere i membri della casta in barba al principio di eguaglianza di tutti i cittadini di fronte alla legge se il tizio accusato di aver rubato 6 milioni avesse ricevuto in carcere decine di visite di parlamentari e membri o ex del governo di destra e di sinistra alcuni dei quali latori di pizzini inviati da altri politici compreso il premier tutti graniticamente convinti della sua innocenza e della colpevolezza dei giudici la notizia avrebbe destato enorme scalpore tutti si sarebbero domandati a che titolo tanti politici ammesso e non concesso che li avessero fatti entrare solidarizzassero in cella con un signore sospettato di reati tanto gravi e cosavessero da spartire con uno cosi invece il pellegrinaggio di amici e colleghi nella cella di del turco ufficialmente in isolamento e passata come una normale quasi doverosa testimonianza di solidarieta allillustre recluso anzi e bastato che veltroni manifestasse la sua fiducia nella magistratura evitando di emettere sentenze che non gli competono per esser bollato di ipocrisia e antisocialismo ieri sul corriere pigi battista ha fornito un catalogo completo del razzismo sociale applicato alla giustizia in un memorabile commento dal titolo e se del turco fosse innocente il prode pigi lacrima perche del turco fu prelevato dalla sua casa allalba come il peggiore dei malfattori frase rivelatrice quantaltre mai del doppiopesismo classista di cui sopra se non ne ricorrono i presupposti di legge non si arresta ne allalba ne al tramonto ne prima ne dopo i pasti ma se i presupposti ci sono lorario e le modalita dellarresto sono del tutto secondari rispetto ai fatti che lhanno originato invece per tutti i battista ditalia i signori se proprio si vuole arrestarli meritano le manette di prima classe quelle di velluto possibilmente precedute da una telefonata di cortesia infatti pigi chiede addirittura un risarcimento per del turco scarcerato a suo dire con 48 ore di ritardo causa introvabilita del gip rientrato ieri dalle ferie per esaminare lok dato sabato dalla procura ai domiciliari in realta non ce stato alcun ritardo visto che il gip aveva 5 giorni di tempo per rispondere ai pm e ne ha impiegati solo 2 seguono le solite giaculatorie sulla presunzione di innocenza che non centra nulla la custodia cautelare riguarda sempre i presunti non colpevoli altrimenti non sarebbe cautelare ma definitiva in carcere ci sono 30 mila persone nelle condizioni di del turco ma naturalmente battista si muove solo per del turco e lo paragona addirittura a enzo tortora sol perche non se ancora scoperto dove sono andati a finire i proventi delle presunte mazzette ci sarebbe pure la possibilita sostenuta dai pm che i soldi siano finiti in alcuni immobili e o in qualche conto cifrato nei paradisi fiscali ma lo sherlock holmes di via solferino non sente ragioni se uno puta caso nasconde bene la refurtiva vuol dire che e innocente attendiamo con ansia un editoriale dal titolo rovesciato e se del turco fosse colpevole cioe se fosse come craxi come contrada come mambro e fioravanti per citare solo alcuni dei condannati definitivi che battista e il corriere continuano a trattare da innocenti come pure i 18 pregiudicati da dellutri in giu che popolano il parlamento ecco se del turco fosse colpevole sarebbe innocente lo stesso

6603762 general grant addressed the room and reported there was classified research taking place within the mountain complex that he was not at liberty to discuss he said several members of the city were involved in this research and knew of it i saw several city council members glance at each other nodding in fact the general continued they recruited heavily from the city itself for people to be involved in the project due to the unique training each of them had been given before being granted citizenship
6603763 again there were several nods around the room and i was able to tell that none of this was new to the members of the city council
6603764 then the general categorically denied that the classified project had anything at all to do with the lake or what had happened there the military complex in the mountain had nothing to do with rogue attacks on clansmen and the village had nothing to fear from them he was deeply hurt at the unfounded allegations and hoped improved communication would prevent further misunderstandings
6603765 i asked why we had been ordered to keep crow and his group from the village and what made the general think they had the right to order us to do anything the general reddened and said a mistake had been made we were civilians and should not have been ordered to do anything like that they should have sent a military unit
6603766 when the city council asked why it had been so important to keep crow and the others away from the village the general said it had been considered important to preserve the integrity of the training itself and not compromise the intent of the requirements of citizenship open communication with the village would jeopardize the quality of the training the apprentices were receiving and complicate the duties of the medics
6603767 the general went on to assure the room there had been no bad intent and the interests of the city had been foremost in all of these activities the mayor seemed content with this and asked the city council and any of the circle members if they had anything to add before adjourning i was furious at the generals denial of military involvement and the city councils apparent acceptance of his explanation but i knew when i was outclassed there was simply nothing more that i could do
6603768 the mayor was about to adjourn the meeting when something impossible happened howling wolf appeared in the middle of the room out of nowhere he simply appeared out of thin air and addressed all of us
6603769 he told us that general grant was telling lies then he said he would tell us the true story he said that thirty years ago ron and rachel kane were citizens of heliopolis and involved in the creation of the social experiment we are all familiar with called sanctuary their main circle and gathering spot for the apprentice degree was located at the lake by the waterfall the journeyman and the master locations are the same today as they were then
6603770 howling wolf said the social experiment was funded by the federation and closely monitored within the mountain complex its commanding officer was lieutenant colonel harry kane brother to ron kane ron and rachel kane were the parents of tobal kane who is now soon to enter journeyman status there were whispers around the room at this as several city council members looked at each other
6603771 then howling wolf explained the sanctuary program was just a front for a type of much more advanced research namely time travel some gasps filled the room and i noticed there were several white faces including the generals
6603772 he said ron and rachel kane created a machine capable of sending a person forward in time into the future or backward into the past the problem was ron and rachel were the only ones that could use it it wouldnt work for anyone else and no one knew why
6603773 ron and rachel continued travelling forward and backward into time the scientists continued to think of way to improve the machine ron and rachel believed it was a human problem and not a machine problem and worked in secret with a small handful of trusted friends they developed techniques that would prepare an individual for time travel the most important was the technique of bi location
6603774 howling wolf told us that he appeared in the room using bi location techniques he learned from ron and rachel kane and has been teaching to his own students since that time there were gasps and hard looks on the faces of some of the city council members
6603775 he said the bi location process does not require a machine time travel does not require a machine either there was a small handful of people taught to how to time travel by linking with ron and rachel and then they were able to do it on their own without help he said he knew of several others still living that were now doing this and teaching others how to do it
6603776 howling wolf said the group was time traveling when the massacre at the gathering spot occurred his wife and children were murdered and so was sarah gardners mother sarah is another apprentice that is now teaching her second newbie to solo fortunately two of his grandchildren were not at the gathering spot and are alive today they are also currently enrolled in the sanctuary program he told how stunned the group was when they arrived back at the gathering spot and found everyone murdered
6603777 he then told how ron and rachel told them to flee they were going to talk with rons brother and find out what had happened they agreed to meet at a specific location in history where they often met up before the entire group fled and later tried meeting but ron and rachel never came howling wolf got very angry and said his son and wife were hunted down and executed he found out later that ron and rachel had been declared dead by his brother harry and their son tobal was taken by his uncle to be raised

6603779 kuzkin proved to be a major threat at both ends of the ice playing stellar defense in his own zone and then turning up ice to attack scoring an impressive 70 goals in 530 career games with his club team
6603780 viktor never lost his cool in tough situation and had a knack for rallying the team its no coincidence that he captained the army and national squads for so many years an exemplary sportsman and very courageous on the ice kuzkin was generous and unassuming in everyday life
6603781 i can tell you that ive never been approached or had any discussions with vancouver regarding brendan
6603782 weve only been having discussions with one team and thats the new york rangers
6603783 brendan still feels he has a job that he wants to finish with the rangers and he knows he has some good hockey left in him he fully intends on playing next year and at the moment his intention is to play with the rangers

6603789 we have 125 security guards and about 40 police if it gets close some will come from other areas to the ground so if he gets to 98 or 99 goals we will have more security on hand on the ground to make sure everyone is safe
6603790 we are telling people not to run out but if they do in large numbers we have procedures in place to ensure everyone is safe everyone knows where to go and what to do if it happens
6603791 it depends if its safer to leave him there or take him off he will be surrounded by his teammates and then police and security
6603792 west coast have been briefed and they know where to mingle if he kicks it the umpires and some of the hawthorn players and the eagles down the other end will have their own separate security guards
6603793 im a big fan of michael phelps hes like the young jeezy of the swim world

6603821 it has been a little bit of a struggle again its hot weather were in august but yeah we have to start swinging the bats better than we have here lately
6603822 man if was qb sf would have recovered mannings fumble
6603823 we had a pretty good run through april may june and july
6603824 if you really look at it two weeks before the all star break we hit a bad spell
6603825 in fact people thought we were going to be in a spell all year looking back at it but we think we pitched well all year other than that time
6603826 the bottom line is the pitching staff has worked so hard that it has put us in a great position it has to surprise everyone with what theyve done
6603827 the bottom line is that there were so many question marks coming in and they stood up well to this date and we need them to stand up the rest of the season
6603828 do you still count of course youre diabetic youre fat i hate it every doctor since i was in highschool when i was a whole 56
6603829 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6603830 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capital and is proud of it
6603831 the use of 9 11 imagery links ayers and obama to the american conflict with islamic terror
6603832 which is the subject of many viral e mails attacking obama the groups spokesman christian pinkston called the suggestion that the group is making any link with islam unfair
6603833 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6603834 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6603835 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6603836 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6603837 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6603838 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6603839 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6603840 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6603841 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6603842 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6603843 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6603844 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6603845 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6603846 you dont want to have a setback this late in the process well just see how it is

6603869 the biggest reason why this race remains close in this dem leaning political environment is because of obamas inability to close the deal with some of clintons supporters

6603873 after fighting density at public meetings throughout the year even nimbys need a vacation when the weather is right and they feel like escaping their one dwelling unit per acre suburban subdivisions for some rest and relaxation these neighborhood activists often head for places like the jersey shore
6603874 a good deal of the vibrancy in resort towns like those at the shore may be attributed to something that many visitors would claim revulsion to in their hometowns density
6603875 where even the quietest blocks have a typical residential density of around 12 dwelling units per acre
6603876 parents who fight ordinances permitting dangerous alleys at home let their children ride bikes alone through them at the shore every block has a sidewalk used for short walks to shops schools churches and of course the ocean single family homes sit snugly next to each other or next to townhomes which often sit close to lowrise hotels sandwich shops without dedicated parking spaces are full of patrons all day most homes have porches and families wind down the day by sitting in them and waving to anyone who walks by they are things that planners struggle to convince towns to allow yet are often denied by citizen groups who protest citing concerns including reduced quality of life

6604032 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6604033 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6604034 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6604035 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6604036 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6604037 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building

6604056 utilizing selective arrests and prosecutions the federal government has sought to sabotage californias reasoned approach to medical marijuana use
6604057 for the first time a court has recognized that a calculated plan by the federal government to undercut state medical marijuana laws is patently unconstitutional todays decision forecasts an end to any organized federal effort to sabotage state medical marijuana laws
6604058 it is obvious to anyone paying attention that federal officials have gone to great lengths to sabotage state efforts to allow for appropriate medical marijuana use

6604060 the federal government has purposely set out to systematically subvert californias medical marijuana program
6604061 let us hope that this ruling leads to the merciful end of the federal governments cruel war on sick and dying medical marijuana patients

6604068 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6604069 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6604070 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6604071 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6604072 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6604073 much of the debate about the improvement of systems of educational assessment focus on binaries is reliability more important than validity are constructed response items better than multiple choice items is teacher assessment better than externally set tests and examinations is continuous assessment through coursework better than terminal examinations in this talk i will argue that as long as the debate is conducted in terms of such either or issues then progress will be slow if not entirely absent rather progress is to be made by mapping out the shades of grey between these extremes understanding how each end of the spectrum is useful in helping us understand the spectrum and the tensions we have to reconcile but lethal as a goal in itself
6604074 frequent feedback is not necessarily formative feedback that causes improvement is not necessarily formative assessment is formative only if the information fed back to the learner is used by the learner in making improvements to be formative assessment must include a recipe for future action

6604112 while the republican convention went on he was picking judges for western massachusetts
6604113 and the lesson was an election can be lost in august
6604114 the candidate usually keeps a low profile during the opposition convention certainly bush did in 2004
6604115 the polls are tightening youre seeing a sharper tone out of barack obama
6604116 we think he recognizes that theres a shift in this race and that the republican party independents and conservative democrats have recognized that john mccain is the candidate and the leadership that we need in the next four years

6604125 it was a mutual agreement we both sat down and talked

6604130 we knew that the install base was growing and people are still buying carnival games so we wanted to build on the success of it but with a different type of gameplay
6604131 we think the market can hold both of these carnival games we were originally going to put carnival games 2
6604132 it wasnt in development but it was definitely in concepting
6604133 we saw the original title was a big success and we had the developers cat daddy thinking down the line for the brand so there will be a carnival games 2 but when that is i cant say that right now we just have to assess the market and see when the right time is to release the title
6604134 many civil servants fly from bonn to berlin to take part in meetings that last only 30 minutes thats unacceptable both from an
6604135 we came to bonn in 1999 specifically because the development ministry and many aid groups were here
6604136 to us it doesnt matter that the government is no longer here
6604137 its a clear advantage that so many firms in our sector are based here its a cluster
6604138 this is not about 9 000 jobs in the ministries
6604139 if they moved it would endanger sectors with large synergies such as research development and the environment
6604140 if the ministries were to move to berlin we would certainly feel the economic effect
6604141 the development ministry is our most important financial partner if it moved we would have to think about following
6604142 berlin is the political centre thats where the future is

6604179 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6604180 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support

6604187 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6604188 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6604189 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6604190 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events

6604192 mother baby and family are all happy and healthy he said in a statement associated press reported
6604193 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6604194 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6604195 staff were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6604196 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6604197 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6604198 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6604199 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6604200 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6604201 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6604202 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6604203 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6604204 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6604205 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6604206 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6604207 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment

6604252 our short to medium term focus will be honing our retail formula for future growth from this base
6604253 this government is going to see significant and extended industrial action for the coming months unless they wake up to themselves and actually make an offer that means that the real wages are maintained over the next couple of years in a high inflation environment
6604254 the reserve bank understands this the federal government understands it inflation is high 3 25 per cent wont fix it
6604255 the state government is trying to force public sector workers in main roads in qbuild in hospitals and in schools across the board to try and cut their wages by only offering 3 25 per cent when inflation is running at 5 per cent
6604256 this is unfortunate that the government wants to basically to cut wages and no one can afford to do that in the present economic climate
6604257 so the government and the minister involved warren pitt main roads minister are going to have to have a reality check

6604271 batsmen a few years ago could have read mendis better if he had been bowling at that time
6604272 the indian batsmen will have to play according to each ball of mendis and would have to observe him while taking him on every bowler has some distinct pattern of bowling either through his shoulder movement or hand action and that is what could be central to tackle mendis

6604298 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6604299 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia

6604322 maccleanse looks like a really neat app that could be very useful
6604323 it surely cleans out all the dirt in my mac for the new year
6604324 look at it this way if we get a new start in 2008 why shouldnt our mac

6604330 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6604331 the real person must be constituted by the almost infinitely complex information bearing pattern carried at any one moment by those ever changing atoms such a concept is difficult to articulate with any degree of precision but the idea is consistent with the growing scientific recognition of the significance of information and it represents a revival in modern dress of the aristotelian thomistic notion of the soul as the form of the body
6604332 een dergelijke zoektocht levert echter niet veel op immers het is evident dat het lichaam volledig vergaat wanneer we sterven
6604333 hoe moeten we dan denken over de ziel en de zin van het bestaan
6604334 om te ontdekken wat de zin van het leven is mag je van de mensen enige inspanning verwachten
6604335 het leven is zonder doel en daarom zijn alle handelingen van de mens ongegrond en willekeurig
6604336 wie een levensbeschouwing propageert die iedere hoop uitsluit maakt het zichzelf onmogelijk om een gewoon menselijk leven te leiden hij propageert immers de zinloosheid van zijn eigen bestaan
6604337 de hoop dat al het lijden en alle verschrikkingen eens mogen worden ingewisseld voor een beter en gelukkiger bestaan kortweg hoop
6604338 verwijs hierbij naar het blog van simon waarbij hoop kennelijk essentieel is voor geloof
6604339 een diep filosofisch inzicht het moet door vele filosofen ontdekt zijn en er zal wel een woord voor zijn ieder menselijk individu treft zichzelf aan in een wereld die hij zelf niet geschapen heeft
6604340 las empresas invierten mucho en recursos t cnicos hardware software maquinarias etc y muy poco en capital humano

6604346 at the door they told me she could not enter i responded as i always do shes a service animal
6604347 i repeated again shes a service animal and he said that doesnt matter shes a health code violation
6604348 we want to resolve those as best we can and we generally do so give us a chance and well give the customer a chance and well move forward
6604349 we had other customers commenting in regards to her service animal
6604350 she was on a leash i dont believe it was very close to her at the time and didnt have any signifying marks that it was a service animal
6604351 ive learned in my experience that anything made by man can be improved upon
6604352 so we can do even better than we are doing today
6604353 we like to be able to track where the employees are going for a host of reasons
6604354 one certainly you want to maximize the efficiency of routing and we want to make sure the vehicles are being used in the way they are intended to be used
6604355 its a recruitment point it also helps us keep neighborhoods safe neighbors like to see a police car parked in the driveways of the neighborhoods
6604356 the aircraft performs totally different at these high altitudes than the low altitudes we usually work with

6604375 strikt genomen heb je onze moderne wetenschap niet nodig om te ontdekken dat het leven nogal willekeurig kan zijn ook in de oudheid en de middeleeuwen valt het de mensen al op dat het leven van een mens door stom toeval lijkt te worden bepaald
6604376 waarschijnlijk doen we de werkelijkheid meer recht als we zeggen dat religies middelen en methoden zijn om het bestaan van de mens betekenis te geven
6604377 het verkrijgen van de onsterfelijkheid is een van de mogelijke manieren om het bestaan van de mens van blijvende waarde te maken
6604378 de naturalist trekt hieruit de conclusie dat de mens geen bijzondere status heeft het bestaan van de mens is volstrekt zonder betekenis
6604379 iemand die zijn eigen leven letterlijk waardeloos vindt kan geen fatsoenlijk bestaan opbouwen
6604380 waar de mens zich bovenal tegen verzet is het idee dat zijn bestaan willekeurig en zinloos is dat is de kern van alle religie en levensbeschouwing
6604381 eerlijk gezegd is dit niet de soort zin waarover ik spreek als iets zinvol is dan moet het universeel zijn
6604382 ga eens op onderzoek misschien vind je iets van je gading heb je een handboek over religie geraadpleegd een goede inleiding is
6604383 if you dont believe in a supreme being who send an angel to a 40 year old bussinessman in mecca and dictated a holy text then you are in trouble
6604384 dan ben je in de praktijk veroordeeld tot het leiden van een leven waarvan je de zin per definitie niet ziet en dat iedere metafysische onderbouwing mist
6604385 bent u bezig met een theologische filosofische of wetenschappelijke fundering van de zin van het leven

6604409 ioc orders investigation into he kexins age by chris chase the international olympic committee has ordered an investigation into the age of chinese gymnast he kexin the times of london reports faced with almost insurmountable evidence which suggests that he is two years younger than the birth date listed on her chinese passport the ioc has launched an inquiry that could result in the stripping of hes gold medals this news comes on the heels of another times report that details the findings of a new york computer security expert who found official chinese documents that list hes age as 14 years and 220 days mike walker used a chinese search engines cache feature to find hes actual date of birth on spreadsheets from a chinese government website the spreadsheets were taken down off the site recently and hes name had been removed assuming the ioc is committed to a real investigation and not some dog and pony show the revelation that the chinese government covered up the ages of gymnasts could end up being the defining moment of these games for the host country officials wanted the olympics to be a coming out party for a new china but while the games have been a huge success there is a legitimate possibility that chinas legacy from beijing 08 will be that of a massive government cover up not the magical opening ceremony or the transformation of beijing or anything else positive all the good work china did to put on these olympics could be forgotten because of an unnecessary arrogant move by the government why risk everything to put a 14 year old in the competition when they could have replaced her with an of age 16 year old gymnast sure he is a better gymnast than the chinese gymnasts who were eligible to compete but with the judges they had at the olympics would it really have mattered

6604462 we did not tackle except for three kicking team plays so some of the stats are skewed
6604463 most of the plays were stopped as soon as the runner was touched we wanted to make sure that georgia southern got as many offensive snaps as georgia did
6604464 we got a good chance to work on all the transitions of the kicking game for instance from third down to punt from touchdown to extra point and from third down to field goal

6604501 labor day is a glorious holiday because your child will be going back to school the next day it would have been called independence day but that name was already taken
6604502 a man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought there is a visible labor and there is an invisible labor
6604503 he who labors diligently need never despair for all things are accomplished by diligence and labor
6604504 all labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence
6604505 no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country by living wages i mean more than a bare subsistence level i mean the wages of decent living
6604506 labor disgraces no man unfortunately you occasionally find men who disgrace labor
6604507 labor day differs in every essential from other holidays of the year in any country all other holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflict and battles of mans prowess over man of strife and discord for greed and power of glories achieved by one nation over another labor day is devoted to no man living or dead to no sect race or nation

6604517 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6604518 what weve decided to do is to reduce the distribution payment policy to 75 of operating income for the 08 09 financial year and well also change the frequency of the distributions to six monthly mr goodman said
6604519 so were going to retain 25 of the earnings and they will go into long term and shareholders growth and obviously very sensible capital management
6604520 theres no need to raise any capital mr goodman said given that the group had about 2 5 billion in liquidity and assets
6604521 there have been some rumours for quite some time about different groups going to the market for capital mr goodman said a corker too dear to drink
6604522 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
6604523 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewellers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms
6604524 while we are looking at god we do not see ourselves blessed riddance the man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering with his soul and looks away to the perfect one while he looks at christ the very thing he has so long been trying to do will be getting done within him
6604525 we cant go home its not there for us anymore
6604526 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyones has seen for a long period of time
6604527 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of six per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6604528 what weve decided to do is to reduce the distribution payment policy to 75 per cent of operating income for the 08 09 financial year and well also change the frequency of the distributions as well to six monthly
6604529 so were going to retain 25 per cent of the earnings and they will go into long term and shareholders growth and obviously very sensible capital management
6604530 awe has completed the 2007 08 financial year in excellent financial shape and with a number of growth opportunities still ahead
6604531 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6604532 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6604533 reception wont be available for some huge number years later
6604534 with these defenses what predator would be able to get through to it
6604535 mr mccain has lost track of how many houses he owns heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain into
6604536 the australian market for transport fuels and convenience retailing will continue to grow and caltex is well positioned to capture future market opportunities
6604537 refiner margins are expected to be volatile but remain robust overall
6604538 continued strength in diesel and jet fuel margins will likely compensate for the expected weakening in petrol demand
6604539 caltex recognised early in 2008 the possible negative impact of rising crude oil prices and reduced petrol demand caused by the us economic slowdown and took measures to respond to these challenges
6604540 sales of regular petrol eased in line with the overall market but caltex outstripped the market in growth of diesel jet fuel and higher margin premium petrol sales
6604541 lubricants sales volumes and margins increased as did margins for specialties
6604542 caltex remains committed to a conservative balance sheet and will continue its focus on good cash management
6604543 i parked my car thinking that my wifes bus must have been delayed by what had happened but it must have been fractionally early
6604544 at virtually the same time the paramedics arrived they were doing their best to help and i was holding a saline drip for them
6604545 then another person who had stopped handed me a handbag and i recognised it i always pick her up so she doesnt have to walk home i couldnt believe it
6604546 its no reassurance to me that i was there at her final moments theres not much reassurance anywhere im devastated
6604547 she had been struck by a car as she crossed the road im being looked after by my family but it is hard my wife was perfect
6604548 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6604549 we dont want to be one of those groups that comes back 15 years later and puts out an album thats not that good its why the beatles never got back together
6604550 made hip hop a true art form doing for rap what bob dylan did for rock in the mid 60s
6604551 essentially an album thats put together like a mix tape
6604552 you cant expect food nutrition directors to be filling up their trunk with produce
6604553 there really could be a positive connection between farms and schools if we can have someone to fill the gaps
6604554 they will make a meaningful contribution to a more nutritious diet for washington school kids and economic opportunity for the states fruit and vegetable growers
6604555 theyre going to see a difference right away in what they can do and provide for their kids
6604556 oddly enough to those of us that are pretty used to buying fruits and vegetables things like snap peas or jicama dont sound so unusual but for many kids its the first time theyve tasted a mango or even a radish
6604557 just like parents struggling at home were having to evaluate all of our purchases
6604558 this wont cover the increases entirely but it will help
6604559 i assumed that once this bill passed wed have some folks calling us but no one has
6604560 so were back to where we were before trying to broker our own relationships
6604561 this will allow kids to have those fresh fruits and vegetables at different times throughout the day
6604562 that way the kids who are high poverty wont go home hungry
6604563 the grant program lets us do some wonderful things at one school
6604564 but were trying to find things that are sustainable for all schools not just some
6604565 the two most important facts about the new investment policy are that it significantly improves the probability the pbgc will be able to meet its obligations and that it does so while taking less short term and long term risk
6604566 if sixth graders in america took finance i could say to you that as every sixth grader knows diversification mitigates risk and this policy is substantially more diversified and that is why it has a lower standard deviation
6604567 diversification does reduce volatility but the risk of a wipeout in the economy can only be hedged by owning treasury bonds
6604568 so the big downside risk that really matters is not reduced by the greater diversification in the new portfolio smaller downdrafts yes lower volatility in normal times yes and much greater upsides yes no argument about the upsides it is the downsides where i do not see where they can say what they say
6604569 if we didnt match our liabilities but just sort of shot for the moon if you will the taxpayer would be providing portfolio insurance for our bets in the market
6604570 obama campaign response to mccains comment that corsis book is funny
6604571 obama campaign response to mccain attack on obama record on afghanistan
6604572 obama campaign response to republican national committee attack on obamas bipartisan record
6604573 mr obama struck back with tough language although his delivery was largely without passion
6604574 the greatest national security judgments of this decade have been iraq and afghanistan
6604575 it will be a massive number id like to get 400 players and i have asked them to bring multiple drums
6604576 this all started with my desire to reach the world with a vibration
6604577 a vibration when it becomes high and strong turns into colors and light and then it can turn into an electrical charge
6604578 i just need the total sound in cleveland i got that vibration whether they were on the beat together or not besides theres a section where the chaos is intentional
6604579 so i wrote out some ideas based on them ive known halim for a long time so it didnt surprise me that hed want to include that element
6604580 isis is the mother and lover while oshun is the water goddess and mayat the goddess of balance
6604581 i was stunned how many people know isis some are in groups that are followers i got a greater response for isis in ohio than in the middle east
6604582 we want them to have the ability to move through the orchestra
6604583 well have middle eastern dancers african dancers and spontaneous dancing from the crowd
6604584 there can be an awakening of humanity we can discover ourselves
6604585 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6604586 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6604587 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6604588 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6604589 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6604590 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6604591 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6604592 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6604593 whether buying or selling the lease option really works for buyers and sellers
6604594 the new name is more representative of our market place and new footprint across the panhandle
6604595 since both banks serve contiguous markets along the gulf coast from the alabama state line to panama city and offer products and services that benefit similar customer needs it was a natural fit to combine their resources under one name
6604596 a new name was selected for the combined bank that we believe better represents its expanded role all across the florida panhandle
6604597 same products and keep the same account numbers it will be a seamless transition
6604598 book bloggers ferret out the most interesting reviews for us and sometimes provide incredibly cogent commentary on them but they consistently rely on print book review sections to get the conversations going
6604599 why dont we as readers give book reviews on blogs as much respect as book reviews in major market papers
6604600 book reviewing bloggers need to move away from opinion in favor of judgement
6604601 this book is so bad id like to shoot it out of a canon
6604602 oiga pero no me dir que toda la sociedad est influida por esos anuncios
6604603 me hace lenta la terapia para que no deje de pagarle nunca
6604604 cada que adelgazo me hace engordar de nuevo para que le siga pagando
6604605 pero los pensamientos las fantas as y los sue os los conocemos
6604606 our short to medium term focus will be honing our retail formula for future growth from this base
6604607 the medicare drug benefit has produced tangible relief for millions of people despite the unusual coverage gap that was created to make the benefit fit within budget constraints
6604608 but if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6604609 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6604610 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6604611 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6604612 unlike a lot of other crimes bias crimes really reverberate through select communities in the city
6604613 one incident in one neighborhood can affect thousands of peoples perceptions of how theyre going to be treated
6604614 in order to address the problem of bias attacks people have to know how often and where they happen our first source is the police department and its critical that police gather that information and report it to public
6604615 police arent going to come up to you and say do you think you were attacked because you were gay that could be construed as bias by the police
6604616 under the law it doesnt matter if the perpetrator is right or wrong all that matters is what was said

6604623 this had been a long term well thought out process
6604624 to see everyone in this fuckin place jumpin to the beat
6604625 theyre a little bit more classy than some of those crazy rainbow cards that are usually available
6604626 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6604627 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6604628 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6604629 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6604630 but its nice to see a big mainstream card company like hallmark responding to this demand
6604631 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6604632 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6604633 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6604634 from this vantage point i can see we are going to have a very difficult budget year
6604635 we all have to ensure that we work as educational institutions in partnership and collaboration starting at pre kindergarten through higher education and technical colleges
6604636 we can not allow anyone to be pitting us against each other because it takes a complete system to be invested in if were truly going to link in a line between what we do in the education system with our workforce development needs
6604637 it is the first step in our saying to the wider world this is what we would like you to do in the way of investing in our kids future and in the states future in the 09 11 biennium
6604638 quality education from pre kindergarten through higher education is really the foundation for all of our workforce development needs in the state of wisconsin so we can fill the jobs we have now and attract the kind of jobs were going to want for a vital economy
6604639 we are in a difficult situation as a state where do you find new revenue for investment into the kinds of things we really need to enhance and expand so thats the debate where do we find new revenue in order to invest in education
6604640 as you can imagine this has been the culmination of oh i dont know how many years of work
6604641 i think we identified the need for a building in 1997 or 1998 and weve been working away at it and identifying what were going to be and how to do it to come this far and have approval i think is dramatic
6604642 we wont have the numbers coming out of the service that we did after world war ii but we will have many more veterans coming out now than we would have had without the ramp up in the war in afghanistan and iraq
6604643 these veterans are by and large mature people whove had responsibilities in the service many of them come back really willing and wanting to learn and we need to find ways to make it relatively simple for them to get into our campuses to get the services they need when theyre there
6604644 we also recognize that there is a lot of diversity among the veterans they are a more diverse group than our current students are now and if we are successful in attracting them we will provide the kind of diversity we seek on many of our campuses
6604645 and we know if we dont get more veterans in we wont reach the number of baccalaureate degree holders we need in wisconsin for a prosperous economy
6604646 if theres demand and they have dont have the ability and resources to do it wed be interested in helping them
6604647 were not certain the nih will want to have this contract renewed
6604648 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6604649 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6604650 but the stock was priced for ongoing perfection and we didnt get perfection
6604651 we are downgrading crm to a neutral rating and lowering our price target to 65 was 81 as we believe there is less upside in the business model
6604652 the street was looking for slightly better growth from q1 to q2
6604653 that has caused some concern about a slowdown in large deals
6604654 the business is changing because salesforce is becoming more strategic for larger buyers
6604655 this trend changes the timing for when the business comes in this doesnt mean there is less revenue just that its signed up later in the year
6604656 more than anything this setback was the result of a high valuation and high expectations
6604657 if the stock was not so pricey say closer to the low 50s then we probably would have just shrugged it off
6604658 while billings are slowing as numbers get larger we think cash flow growth argues for upside in the shares
6604659 wenn mehr als drei von ihnen einer meinung waren habe ich ihre einw nde beachtet wirklich weil ich wusste dies ist eine pr fung die f hrer wussten dies ist eine gewaltige angelegenheit f r die nation
6604660 sie hatten alle einen klaren kopf diese neuen f hrer sind alle hochschulabsolventen mit einem magister oder doktortitel
6604661 the presence of such students would increase gun and knife crime and so require more security
6604662 thought it would be funny to hold up a poster saying bring back slavery
6604663 her brothers name was too foreign sounding to be used in promotional materials
6604664 we do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it
6604665 sorry but you are looking for something that isnt here
6604666 an unforgivable traitor to his country responsible among much else for the assassination by his soviet associates of many brave men all i can say is that in the half of him that i knew the deceitful half of course he was a most enjoyable friend
6604667 this is dynamite two huge stars who everyone assumed were best mates are having a great big spat through the pages of our magazine
6604668 shes in a troubled state and the paparazzi arent helping
6604669 mark is not a celebrity he does not expect to be part of that world he sees his job as just a job i sat next to him for give or take 10 years it was all huge fun
6604670 he created an atmosphere at the magazine where there is no real hierarchy everyones equal it was often those jokey conversations in the office that went into the magazine mark created something that spoke in the same langauge that we would use
6604671 in the modern world of celebrity people know if they go out without their make up on there is probably going to be a picture of them
6604672 this is part of being famous and apart from a couple of major hollywood stars i dont think they recoil from that i dont do the magazine for ewan mcgregor i do it for 550 000 readers
6604673 i think he was a great editor i actually tried to hire him
6604674 i first knew of him when i saw him on sky news in about 1993 talking about celebrities he looked very skittish very nervous talking in his sheffield accent but he went on and became a great editor
6604675 break ing down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6604676 mr laforge have you had any success with your attempts at finding a weakness in the borg and mr data have you been able to access their command pathways
6604677 yes captain in fact we found the answer by searching through our archives on late twentieth century computing technology
6604678 allow me to explain we will send this program for some reason called windows through the borg command pathways once inside their root command unit it will begin consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate
6604679 but the borg have the ability to adapt wont they alter their processing systems to increase their storage capacity
6604680 yes captain but when windows detects this it creates a new version of itself known as an upgrade the use of resources increases exponentially with each iteration the borg will not be able to adapt quickly enough eventually all of their processing ability will be taken over and none will be available for their normal operational functions
6604681 excellent work this is even better than that unsolvable geometric shape idea
6604682 captain we have successfully installed the windows in the command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85 of all resources we however have not received any confirmation of the expected upgrade
6604683 our scanners have picked up an increase in borg storage and cpu capacity to compensate but we still have no indication of an upgrade to compensate for their increase
6604684 data scan the history banks again and determine if their is something we have missed
6604685 sir i believe their is a reason for the failure in the upgrade apparently the borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards
6604686 captain we have no choice requesting permission to begin emergency escape sequence 3f
6604687 wait captain i just detected their cpu capacity has suddenly dropped to 0
6604688 apparently the borg have found the internal windows module named solitaire and it has used up all the cpu capacity
6604689 lets wait and see how long this solitaire can reduce their functionality
6604690 as expected the borg are attempting to re engineer to compensate for increased cpu and storage demands but each time they successfully increase resources i have set up our closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more windows modules from something called the microsoft fun pack
6604691 current borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest time span of 6 more hours
6604692 it appears to have markings very similar to the microsoft logo
6604693 this is admiral bill gates of the microsoft flagship monopoly we have positive confirmation of unregistered software in this sector surrender all assets and we can avoid any trouble you have 10 seconds
6604694 the alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released thousands of humanoid shaped objects
6604695 good god captain those are humans floating straight toward the borg ship with no life support suits how can they survive the tortures of deep space
6604696 i dont believe that those are humans sir if you will look closer i believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by twenty first century man as doe skin leather briefcases and wearing armani suits
6604697 it cant be all the lawyers were rounded up and sent hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the great awakening
6604698 they have surrounded the borg ship and are covering it with all types of papers
6604699 i believe that is known in ancient vernacular as red tape i understand that it often proves fatal
6604700 theres no place id rather be than here with you guys right now
6604701 that was the day i fell in love with him and im still in love with him
6604702 pleading for some kind of intelligence or humanity from the person on the other end of the phone
6604703 organisations seem to imagine that sticking to procedures is in itself a virtue
6604704 the majority of employees are too frightened of getting things wrong to make that effort give them a procedure and theyll follow it blindly
6604705 working to rules with no opportunity to use your initiative must be as depressing for employees as it is for us on the receiving end companies must be calculating that the frustration on both sides matters less than cutting costs
6604706 it will always have its ups and downs and as a growing state we want to have a vital and vibrant housing industry but were going to have to have some other things too and were going to have to work to support those sorts of things
6604707 i believe that arizona should be the persian gulf of solar among other things and that in and of itself is a new industry that will create jobs and all the rest within our beautiful state
6604708 look ah i will take it that the question is a flattering one and all im going to say is i enjoy being the governor of arizona i think this is a great state working together well make it even greater
6604709 id always said id never write a book like this
6604710 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6604711 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6604712 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6604713 and he and about four other people would read that
6604714 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6604715 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6604716 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6604717 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6604718 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6604719 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6604720 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6604721 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6604722 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6604723 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6604724 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here
6604725 when they called it was total bolt out of the blue
6604726 set out to become a nice suburban alcoholic and succeeded
6604727 like a b horror flick that was scheduled to run continuously for days
6604728 it helped me remember helped me look in on the wreckage of my past and i really havent had a thirsty day since i started working on it

6604735 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6604736 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out air strikes in bajaur or swat
6604737 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6604738 this is just barbaric we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6604739 only by putting it down in print can i save myself from madness

6604748 most of the donors are my friends and the majority are other firefighters
6604749 i convinced them that now is the time for them to get involved and they did
6604750 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6604751 why are they going to go back to their country and pay someone to bring them over here again

6604794 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6604795 that was the same way he operated as an executive
6604796 id always said id never write a book like this
6604797 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses

6604799 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6604800 and he and about four other people would read that
6604801 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6604802 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird

6604854 i have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them but for the first time i believe i have found the man who could be that president not just for me but for a new generation of americans
6604855 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6604856 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6604857 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6604858 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6604859 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6604860 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6604861 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6604862 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6604875 based on your request we researched the status of this case we are actively processing this case however we have to perform additional review on this case and this has caused a longer processing time

6604879 the single common factor in their success was a large vocabulary and a precise understanding of the words they knew
6604880 it is of vital importance that the quality of education be revitalized and improved as man is as able as he can learn and know it is urgent that a workable learning technology is available to him

6604882 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6604883 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6604884 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6604885 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6604886 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6604887 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6604888 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6604889 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6604890 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6604892 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6604893 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6604894 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients

6604896 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
6604897 another indication of the inexperience senator obama has in conducting foreign policy and maybe an indication of his inability to do so in a way that would be responsible
6604898 aims at strengthening relations at all levels between the united kingdom and syria it will encourage dialogue between the peoples of the two countries and facilitate better understanding and co operation between them
6604899 none of us thought we were being used or abused but we will see over time
6604900 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6604901 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6604902 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6604903 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6604904 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6604905 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6604906 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6604907 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6604908 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6604909 who are open to doing something on the production side
6604910 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6604911 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6604912 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6604913 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6604914 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6604915 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6604916 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6604917 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6604918 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6604919 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6604920 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6604921 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6604922 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6604923 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6604924 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6604925 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6604926 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6604927 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6604928 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6604929 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6604930 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6604931 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6604932 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6604933 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6604934 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6604935 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6604936 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients

6604938 i received calls from people interested in my new business within hours of paying for a submission
6604939 after more than a month of use extensively testing the ts 409 we were left very favorably impressed especially with the seemingly endless array of features and available configurations the ts 409 pro offered good performance data protection and differentiated themselves from their competition
6604940 the added value comes from the extra disks and raid levels supported and when i say raid im not talking about a simple onboard controller the qnap ts 409 pro surprised me with raid 6 although slightly pointless with only 4 disks and features like online expansion and migration such functionality is usually only found on advanced controllers youd find in high end servers
6604941 2 inches less in diameter than it used to be when we got it
6604942 with all the recent fuss over atis 4870 x2 card its no wonder the green camp are bristling a little
6604943 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6604944 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6604945 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6604946 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6604947 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6604948 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6604949 my job is to make sure cooper knows enough to beat me out but ive also got to be the best that i can be to keep cooper on the bench thats the mentality we need to have in turn if weve got two guys that are equal were going to wear people down thats how its supposed to be it shouldnt be a deal where im the starter im not worried about anybody this is my spot that aint miami
6604950 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6604951 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6604952 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6604953 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6604954 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6604955 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6604956 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation

6604959 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6604960 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6604961 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6604962 there are millions of americans across this country for whom faith is important
6604963 and whether they vote on the basis of their faith or whether they vote about issues that are somehow connected to their faith we should be reaching out to them
6604964 there are shades and gradations of what it means to be a democrat
6604965 were not all los angeles new york birkenstock wearing democrats
6604966 the top issues are no longer just abortion and gay marriage
6604967 we want people of faith to know that barack obama is a viable option and a candidate whos not ashamed to stand up and talk about his values
6604968 democrats have developed a keen awareness of the problem and theyre seriously engaged in trying to narrow the gap

6604973 were trying to target a flat line year on year outcome for our ict costs and possibly a little bit lower so certainly thats caught up in our overall cost improvement program
6604974 but you have to consider that we had some high one off costs its a reasonable it spend
6604975 we moved that out of it into our sales and distribution category because its more fairly represented a cost of distribution and sale than an it cost
6604976 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6604977 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6604978 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6604979 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6604980 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6604981 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6604982 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6604983 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6604984 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6604985 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

6605149 it was a whole lotta fun you didnt find a dead place in town sometimes wed just get together as a group and just do jamming you know sometimes the jam sessions would last four or five hours would show up peetie wheatstraw robert johnson was there for a while and of course robert nighthawk big joe williams and my main man sonny boy st louis was a hot town for blues in those days just like chicago
6605150 her singing style with its particular stresses and choppy exclaimed phrasing was not especially unusual no one however converted it to quite such a mannerism
6605151 she was a real nice girl she was real devoted to her blues singing from my point of it she was pretty well a nice mixer with the public and a fairly intelligent girl they used to call her little alice well she was quite small i think at the time they adopted the name to her as little alice but later i think she defeated that name by getting quite some size she got extra size before she died about ten or twelve years ago henry brown has played for alice moore for a fact i think he started her out and she was a devoted blues singer
6605152 i remember alice moore she was a beautiful person a kind hearted person she was a very nice looking black gal she was almost what you would call a pretty girl she had a beautiful smooth skin like velvet i think that had a lot to do with her death too it sounds kinda off the wall but sometimes a lot of things are against a person that dont have an understanding about how to handle it i think it contributed to her living a little fast alice moore ike rodgers and henry brown was a trio i never worked with them but i was around them quite a bit alice seemed to be slightly my senior but not by no big difference but from maturity she seemed to be a little more mature than i was her black and evil was a hit right away that first one she was a pretty black woman aint no doubt about that but the evil part she wasnt evil i dont think but i never was her man and thats the only way youre ever going to find that out she may have been but she never did show it on the surface she always showed kindness everybody like her i dont know how alice died or why it appears to me like i would have heard about it or somebody would have said something about it as many people that knew her and me im inclined to believe that whenever she died it was one of the times that i was away for some reason a lot of the stuff alice recorded henry brown worked with her but jimmy gordon played piano on one of her sessions
6605153 henry townsend played guitar and little alice sang wed play joints on franklin delmar easton spots in east st louis like the blue flame club
6605154 at times the characteristics of african racial features and color have an ominous significance in the blues which may hint that they are indirectly related to social problems so the state of being blue is associated with alienation and is linked with an evil mind or an inclination to violence both are coupled with the inescapable condition of being black that her hearers identified with her theme was evident in the popularity of the blues which she made four times in different versions
6605155 on 17 november 1930 alice probably recorded for victor under the pseudonym alice melvin although these four songs remain unissued two of the titles lonesome woman blues and trouble blues were to be recorded by alice moore on 24 august 1934

6605166 it was just i had some good momentum going and felt like things were turning around for me

6605189 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6605190 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6605191 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6605192 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us

6605194 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6605195 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6605196 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6605197 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6605198 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6605199 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6605200 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6605201 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6605202 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6605227 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6605228 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6605236 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6605237 what weve said previously is that to cater for that well have to hire approximately 300 staff but unfortunately the action we have to take now is to manage the business in the interim

6605247 fox would rather see watchmen killed instead of collecting a percentage at the box office
6605248 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6605249 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6605250 did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements
6605251 it is particularly noteworthy that nothing on the face of the complaint or the documents supplied to the court establishes that watchmen producer larry gordon the claimed source of warner brothers interest in watchmen ever acquired any rights in watchmen

6605266 in 2001 the new york korean film festival and new york asian film festival started together and split up the following year
6605267 they have an emphasis on cult movies and we want to show more mainstream films
6605268 most americans understand that france is not the same as germany or the u k
6605269 so having an asian festival is not enough to represent films from all different cultures
6605270 they definitely dont view it as a positive because the role is so small and he speaks english in it lost is a better example because the characters speak korean but its still not perfect scenes that take place in their apartment back in korea get many details wrong
6605271 filmmakers in both north and south korea have tackled the 17th century robin hood story hong kil dong and the north korean version is actually superior
6605272 in a sense the two different koreas are united by cinema

6605290 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6605291 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6605292 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6605293 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6605294 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6605295 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6605296 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

6605316 after three rounds of failed testing it is apparent that this system is not ready to move forward

6605322 taken together the current behavior of the composite indexes suggests that the risks for further economic weakening in the near term remain elevated
6605323 with summer gas prices reaching an all time high the last thing long island drivers need are gas stations hitting them with exorbitant prices for paying with a credit card
6605324 our investigation revealed that long island is a hotbed for gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they display one price as a way to lure customers and then charge them more at the pump
6605325 todays gas prices dictate that fewer and fewer consumers have enough cash on hand to pay the cash only price to fill up their tanks
6605326 therefore it is inexcusable that business owners would use the lure of lower prices to entice customers and then rip them off these stations are breaking the law and they must immediately stop these deceptive practices or they will be subject to further action by my office
6605327 the aaa commends attorney general cuomo for undertaking this initiative aaa is a proud partner in this fight his warning to the stations engaging in this deceptive act is a welcome service to drivers who desperately need relief at the gas pump

6605369 time to adjust this model so that our publication fees reflect more closely the costs of publication
6605370 in actuality the process is somewhat more convoluted than they let on only the top 10 000 books are updated every hour and the ranking does not depend upon the actual number of books sold but rather on a comparison against the sales figures of the other 9 999 books within that same hour simultaneously a trending calculation is applied to arrive at a computerised sales trajectory
6605371 societies libraries and other scholarly groups are now more likely to undertake publishing ventures themselves
6605372 although they often lack the editing marketing and business skills found in abundance in university presses
6605373 a faculty board that certifies the scholarly quality of the publications a minimum number of publications per year a minimum number of university employed staff including a full time director and a statement of support from the parent organization

6605409 it might be an advantage or a disadvantage they could be motivated to come here and do well but we are focused on making up for the defeat last weekend

6605420 children have an innate curiosity for nature and were able to exercise that curiosity by walking to school in a natural environment
6605421 the opportunity for children to commune with nature on the way to school today has been severely limited by the design of our cities and suburbs and busing
6605422 theyre missing a part of their education as well as some physical activity making the children less happy and prepared to settle down in class when they get to school

6605429 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

6605437 the severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event no clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified the rate of corrosion is also unknown it is possible that this is the result of long term heating in the ground following the collapse of the buildings it is also possible that the phenomenon started prior to collapse and accelerated the weakening of the steel structure a detailed study into the mechanisms of this phenomenon is needed to determine what risk if any is presented to existing steel structures exposed to severe and long burning fires
6605438 weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it

6605455 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6605456 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and know about gene when he pulled around that left side its like a hurricane is coming through he wiped out everything that was there
6605457 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6605458 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6605459 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6605460 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6605461 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players
6605462 playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6605463 he fought me for a while saying no i dont want anything to do with it
6605464 but when i got elected to the executive board to the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field
6605465 all too often when you start talking about those old raider teams everybody just thinks they were a bunch of nuts who just happened to play well together
6605466 but gene played the same way he was as an executive with the players association gene was very clever he was a clever player he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6605467 the initial tests show no tear or break of anything
6605468 it looks like its a bad sprain and he will probably need a couple weeks of rest recuperation and rehab

6605561 when i walked out and was told there had been a shooting at central high school i believed it immediately
6605562 so i guess in that sense i have less innocence im not as quick to go into denial and the reality sunk in a lot quicker
6605563 i didnt know if the person had been caught or apprehended i was concerned that our youth and teenagers be kept safe

6605565 we talk about gun rights but we need to talk about gun responsibilities what do we need to do there to make sure responsibilities are honored
6605566 i dont really know quite how to take this scrimmage
6605567 weve got a group of guys on the second team that has no idea how to play at this level they have no idea and thats very frustrating and very upsetting
6605568 but they wont see the field in certain spots unless its absolutely necessary i can assure you of that
6605569 he came out here to play and some of those second teamers on defense i was talking about were bouncing off him like ping pong balls montario came out here very focused and i thought jon crompton had a nice scrimmage
6605570 we just werent nearly as sharp overall as we needed to be
6605571 we didnt want to take a risk in getting him hurt those other three needed a lot of work and we took that opportunity today
6605572 we have really worked to try and be healthy and weve also worked like heck to have a lot of full speed snaps

6605579 i found out first from my daughter she texted me at 8 17 this morning and said to me she heard someone had been shot

6605581 through the technology of cellphones hunter my oldest twin called and said we are okay
6605582 it just seems like road block after road block no one seems to know where to go whether you come in to the school or to a church down the street
6605583 i chose to walk here only to be turned down and had to walk back to my car
6605584 my sons in that school you know why we are upset no one knows whats going on i want my son
6605585 it was crazy the confusion on whether to go to the church or go to the school i went to the church and they said go to the school i came to the school and they said you couldnt go in and went back to the church
6605586 finally i sat in my car and said i will just drive in circles until i can get to her
6605587 my son decided to skip first period this morning for the first time i am glad he did
6605588 i have never seen so much confusion it made a lot of people upset i wasnt the only one in the parking lot crying they could do a better job
6605589 one mom said do we stand here and wait because they are seniors or do we hug them we ran up and did a big group hug
6605590 i was just so glad to see her standing there and okay i met my sister halfway across the parking lot and just hugged her it was one of the best hugs

6605598 l ast november the agencys finance director took people to the westgate for breakfast for staff development the bill was 420 which included one order of filet mignon two new york strip steaks and 10 coffees at 4 each
6605599 a few hours ago he was lying in this bed and i was knocking on his door to get him up
6605600 he said ive got to get to the bus and so he left i told him i love you we did say that we always say that
6605601 he was trying to grow up without his parents and it was hard
6605602 not only were we father and son we were best friends
6605603 knocked him down on the bed yesterday and kissed him like 30 times and he was so mad and stop kissing me you know but thats my boy thats my best friend hes my everything
6605604 when i asked how he was and they didnt say stable or critical or anything they were like get here just get here and i knew it was bad then
6605605 latch onto your kids and spend all the time you can with them because you take it for granted that someone will be here tomorrow and maybe not you know
6605606 i think were going to be all right after awhile
6605607 the house is going to be quiet and miserable for a long time
6605608 you know when youve prayed about your life and put it in gods hands sometimes he plans surprises for you when you least expect them like at a family wedding you are too tired to appreciate maybe he has a gift for you there
6605609 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6605610 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6605611 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6605612 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6605613 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6605614 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6605615 cleveland steelworkers and usw members across the nation are saddened by the loss of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones no one could stir a crowd quite like stefanie her life force was so strong that she could project it into a weary crowd and get them all on their feet yelling for more she roused our 4 000 local union leaders at the usw constitutional convention in las vegas earlier this month with her fierce support of americas union workers by quoting a passage from her favorite poem let the union spirit take hold of this land let the unions power fill every woman and man urging unprecedented activism in the upcoming november elections she told us there are those who believe gods going take care of everything well thats not faith thats superstition tubbs jones who supported senator hillary clintons candidacy urged everyone to unify behind the presumptive democratic presidential candidate barack obama congresswoman tubbs jones was proud of her life of firsts including being the first african american woman serving on one of the most powerful committees in the house of representatives the ways amp means committee but she was equally proud of her achievements as a judge on the common pleas bench in the state of ohio and as a municipal court judge in the city of cleveland her legacy of leadership will stay with us there was no greater friend of the steelworkers than congresswoman tubbs jones and she will be missed not only by our members but by working men and women nationwide the usw extends our condolences and prayers to her family during this most difficult time
6605616 mccain staffers reported that they had received an envelope containing white powder in mccains campaign office in centennial
6605617 the staff has been quarantined and the building has been evacuated
6605618 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6605619 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6605620 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6605621 a call of a suspicious package containing an unknown powder that was delivered
6605622 at this time the scene has been secured and several people who may have been exposed to the substance are being examined by medical personnel
6605623 the substance is being examined to determine if it is hazardous
6605624 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6605625 immediately upon learning of this federal and local were notified
6605626 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6605627 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6605628 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6605629 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon sen obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6605630 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccain s anytime anytime
6605631 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6605632 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6605633 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6605634 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6605635 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6605636 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6605637 rode straight into the path of the pride care van the van wasnt able to stop in time
6605638 do well in school and we will have a job waiting for you
6605639 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6605640 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6605641 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6605642 it is a very very sad day he was a leader without peers and a dear friend who i will never forget
6605643 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6605644 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6605645 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6605646 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6605647 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6605648 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6605649 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6605650 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6605651 what mccain said at saddleback reverted to standard talking points of this campaign and completely bears out his record and the story in tnr but he cant have it both ways forever when for instance hes standing before the country in a debate and they want to know whether reasonable minds can differ on abortion and whether he will promote policies of inclusiveness regarding the republican party and more importantly policies that consider the humanity of women he will not be able to take both positions each positions holds risks for him and its really a question of the numbers which is nearly unknowable which in my humble and completely unpolltested opinion is why hed be better off being true to his beliefs and seeming genuine rather than humiliate himself doing contortions to get into positions he doesnt believe in
6605652 even though we may sin ultimately we deserve a second chance
6605653 sometimes life is worth living when you make sacrifices so others may benefit
6605654 ok i have been reading comments and this is what i have gathered leigh and alek are going to the booya prom kathi is going to bgpgirls house to rip up obama signs along with her attack dogs finally loved is well that time of the month smiley is trying to use 2 qs on 1 snuggle heather scores big with mail and houseparty and candy is gonna bond us out of q jail tymes thinks he a booyaton and momofbee is a great comment maker

6605657 while important members of the business community and seiu participated in good faith discussions it was unfortunately not possible to achieve a compromise acceptable to a sufficient portion of the business community and the proponents to cause its removal from the ballot
6605658 our goals in sport competition in china emphasize victories while defeats are unacceptable this creates excessive nervousness but american culture puts the emphasis on participation and whether you have done your best if you perform up to your ability and potential then you are the winner and you will be recognized you do not have to back yourself into a corner they can deal with the game outcomes more easily if they lose they will just move on and try again

6605660 something you never wish would have happened happened in madrid said garcia who is from castellon
6605661 i dont know exactly who was in it it doesnt matter even if you dont know anybody its something that you dont want to happen
6605662 its going to be very tough for the families and everybody around it it doesnt matter i wear it because i feel like i want to wear it and i should wear it for the families and all of the people that died
6605663 just the way it happened too its something thats quite sad
6605664 if weather stays this way this course isnt going to get any easier he said
6605665 if it doesnt rain ill be surprised if the winning score is better than 10 under
6605666 i dont think it would be easy for him to come over here said garcia who does plan to spend a few days at the u

6605674 all the doncaster branches of the legion are disgusted that there will not be a veterans day parade
6605675 the council do not seem to care about the achievements of servicemen and women
6605676 i am not homophobic but the council supported both doncaster pride and the mayors civic parade
6605677 dont ever speak to her like that again or ill make you eat those teeth do you understand
6605678 why do you care i could ask the same thing
6605679 someone busted the living room windows out last night sarah
6605680 well nevermind that i want a divorce and i want one now i am sick of your shit jeff and i will not stay in this house a night longer
6605681 yesterday was our 3 year anniversary and where you were i dont know but i refuse to be treated like some little ignorant wench you have been cheating on me since before we were married but my father liked you so i married you i will never again be that stupid i will not remain in a loveless marriage

6605684 i could not nor would not let him stand there and raise his voice at you or curse at you like that sarah i meant what i said he will never speak to you like that again and if it is your wish you will never have to see him again either
6605685 vehicles categories in motors capital equipment categories in business amp industrial mature audiences and real estate
6605686 have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6605687 the deposit could be one of the most important in south america in the last 60 years
6605688 the find is one of the most spectacular and scientifically interesting discoveries of the last decade
6605689 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6605690 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6605691 falling in your first ride doesnt do much for your mental strength bmx can be unpredictable and that race was but mum if youre watching at home im fine and safe
6605692 look out for irelands jamie costin in the 50km walk days before athens he was involved in a horrific car crash and broke his back in two places it was feared he would never walk again yet here he is a true story of what the olympics are all about
6605693 starting 2009 indonesia it self must allocate 20 of its annual budget for education sector hopefully indonesian scientist can give contribution in both domestic and international seminars and journals as well
6605694 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6605695 we believe nov 14 is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday
6605696 it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been making recently
6605697 an environmental assessment of historically significant properties churches wetlands and other related features has to be performed
6605698 any information is very useful to the project team as we strive to locate the highway in the least disruptive manner as possible
6605699 i call it a monster highway because it reminds me of an interstate highway
6605700 i do not think our little community is ready for a monster highway just yet why cant you build a five lane highway with no median
6605701 my familys home dove dale is now listed on the national register of historic places
6605702 special consideration of buildings on the national register is supposed to be given and the mont clare road section should not be widened as much as dot is saying it should
6605703 the highway widening intersects at the black creek baptist church
6605704 our concern is that we would not want the right of way to extend any further than necessary the proposed plan would also come close to black creek baptist church cemetery and we noticed an indentation of 250 feet that could affect the cemeterys current location
6605705 this highway was not constructed to carry the current load it handles
6605706 i have seen the regional dot patch up three major holes but it cant do anything else for that road
6605707 scdot has been working with us and talking about how we can lessen the effect on dovesville recreation
6605708 it would be great if there was a way so that we wouldnt downsize so much and decrease the recreation in the area we would very much appreciate it
6605709 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
6605710 i am we are not considered to be except marginally and stereotypically united states citizens
6605711 from the beginning there has been a pay as you go assumption
6605712 they are trying to live within a budget that is clearly not enough to do everything they want
6605713 if we really want to do everything we said we would like to do its going to take much more money
6605714 was a follow up to earlier inspections in which the same vulnerability existed
6605715 could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew
6605716 the inspector was seeking to close a real danger to the traveling public not looking for a technical violation the tsa stands behind the inspector and that effort
6605717 if not observed by vigilant eagle employees in chicago the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew because of potential damage to the sensitive equipment mounted on the aircraft fuselage
6605718 american eagle is also concerned that the tsa inspectors method of physically hoisting himself up to the jet bridge using a part of the aircraft could have placed him in physical danger
6605719 we caught it this time but who knows if this has happened other times and with other planes that are out there
6605720 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6605721 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6605722 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6605723 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6605724 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6605725 booger red kelly 41 an auto body worker was found guilty overnight of engaging in organised criminal activity
6605726 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children mr davidson said
6605727 booger red amp squo amp squo kelly 41 an auto body worker was found guilty overnight of engaging in organised criminal activity
6605728 theres still a significant amount of cars that are being sold
6605729 theres definitely been a dramatic shift in the last six to 12 months and the car industry needs longer than that to plan for the future
6605730 we are making the right decisions and bringing the focus in 2011 is the right decision
6605731 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined
6605732 darrin is at home in vancouver and has planned a trip to malabar in april
6605733 maybe a massive furry brown boulder rolled into the middle of the road by chance
6605734 mummy the other day i did something naughty in school
6605735 mummy will the teachers laugh at me if i carry a different bag from the school given one to school
6605736 i do c programming on linux for a living using mono so there are definitely jobs out there and more companies seem to be moving to mono every week if you pay attention to the mono mailing lists
6605737 heres our docs and call our guys and come on campus whenever you want when you need help miguel oh and by the way have some free diet cokes and go use our starbucks in the lounge
6605738 i really want to pilfer this open source software but its terms dont let me
6605739 novell has already muted some of the possible trouble makers
6605740 please carry on coding for us dont bother with the details well just make some money with microsoft and only we can offer peace of mind
6605741 ryans a player that can change a game he can be a second striker or a striker or as a winger on either side we can use his versatility we know ryan prefers to play as a striker but its important to have experience in other positions and its always better to play as a winger than be on the bench
6605742 i can confirm that we had a friendly and positive meeting and were moving forward
6605743 this elusive species is a good indicator of forest health large cats need prey and the prey deer macaques and bearded pigs need the forest
6605744 the clouded leopard is the largest predator on borneo there are no tigers having the islands top predator surviving in an ex logging concession hopefully means that the species is resilient
6605745 with more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range and possible range overlap with the smaller cats
6605746 lack of access to clean water is not just about scarcity more than anything it is because of failing governments
6605747 it is the petty corruption which generally involves local police and officials that affects people everyday
6605748 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6605749 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6605750 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6605751 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6605752 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6605753 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6605754 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6605755 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6605756 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6605757 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6605758 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
6605759 this will transform the carbon sink into a carbon source more soil carbon will be released with the melting of glaciers and permafrost
6605760 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
6605761 people in a burning house cannot afford to lose time in an argument
6605762 we have to speed up the pace the negotiations here in accra must deliver concrete results
6605763 governments need to focus on reducing emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation
6605764 progress on substance must be swifter the level of ambition by both developed and developing countries higher and the measures to reduce co2 carbon dioxide emissions stronger
6605765 marlin is like a shrimp they both have gills they both taste delicious were pretty sure both live in trees
6605766 a lot of the known symbionts disappeared and we also saw the appearance of new microbes that tended to have fairly high similarity to bacteria that have previously been isolated from diseased and bleached corals
6605767 if you go from heathrow to athens icao gives 217 kilograms kg of co2 that hides huge variations fly in a full boeing b767 and its nearer to 160 kg per person or fly in a half empty airbus a340 and its more like 360 kg
6605768 its the variations that are missing and that are important
6605769 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6605770 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6605771 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6605772 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6605773 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic
6605774 these concerns are legitimate and need to be heard and respected we strongly support we have to learn from the past
6605775 without quick and robust investment in securing forest community rights these carbon markets will further marginalise the poorest of the poor
6605776 even the world bank is saying that this is the social justice issue of our generation
6605777 the seasons are changing tremendously you can no longer say winter is in november december or march it falls in other months sometimes
6605778 producers can no longer make well laid plans calculations are not the same
6605779 we have a whale whose condition has deteriorated rapidly over the last 24 hours and who now experts are telling us is suffering and weve had to make the hard decision to euthanize the whale
6605780 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6605781 the vets have had a look theyve said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6605782 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6605783 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6605784 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard on
6605785 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6605786 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6605787 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6605788 the big thing thats been happening this year is la nina which has lowered global temperatures somewhat
6605789 la nina has faded in the last couple of months and now we have neutral conditions in the pacific
6605790 the principal thing is to look at the long term trend
6605791 2008 will still be significantly above the long term average theres been a strong upward trend in the last few decades and thats the thing to focus on
6605792 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6605793 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment
6605794 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6605795 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6605796 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6605797 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6605798 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6605799 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6605800 why buy one when we can read a book on how to do it ourselves
6605801 yeah your computer is broken because youve got a virus
6605802 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6605803 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6605812 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6605813 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6605814 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6605815 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6605816 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6605817 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6605818 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6605819 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity

6605823 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury

6605829 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6605830 its a signal but we dont know what it means

6605883 multiple national standards may be appropriate in areas such as building and clothes where local geographic and climatic conditions make unique international standards less useful as a general rule the objective at the international level is to have one globally relevant standard it can sometimes happen especially in fast moving areas such as it that broadly similar standards but focused on different functionalities may each engage the interest of market segments in such cases multiple standards can exist and it is the market that eventually decides which will survive

6605887 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
6605888 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role

6605904 a few things have happened since i shut down my commentary on the flawed selection process that wreaked havoc on my olympic dreams a few weeks ago ron judd of the seattle times broke the story of the lab mistake that allowed jessicas positive sample to sit for weeks in the lab in the article the lab acknowledged that they made a mistake in labeling the sample for normal testing instead of expedited obviously this is a very frustrating revelation furthermore the lab director said that no one from usa swimming or the usoc called to check on the missing sample as the entry deadline approached in fact i have heard usa swimming officials say that they had every confidence that all of the drug tests would come back negative while i can understand that no one would have expected a positive test why do we take those tests in the first place if they arent going to consider and plan for the possibility even if the drug tests had come back by july 11th as usa swimming now says it expected it is not certain that the hearing and appeals process could be finished by the entry deadline anyway regardless of how you look at it usa swimming was negligent in this situation both in planning and execution

6605906 its tuesday and im in des moines i wonder which house my opponent is in today you do know that he has seven houses one for each day of the week so senator mccain which one is your tuesday house
6605907 all of this is going to produce an enormous volume of polling and even more commentary on what those polls mean but polls are less accurate than they claim to be while a typical reported margin of error might be three or four points the actual average error in polls conducted in this years primaries was closer to seven points polls were never really intended to be predictive they establish voter preferences at the time of survey but dont account for how those preferences might change and there are vast and largely unresolved differences of opinion on methodology among pollsters in other words polls require context to be understood and their results are easy for media commentators to cherry pick in order to advance a preferred story
6605908 my opponents campaign has made an issue of my living in a house that cost more than a million dollars
6605909 john mccain has seven houses thats right one house for each day of the week and when he was asked about his houses he didnt remember how many he had
6605910 now im sure there are some people who dont think that people like michele and me deserve to live in a nice house they can think what they want but i can tell you this much we will never ever forget where we live

6605988 but apart from the combative tone the current conflict has nothing in common with the cold war standoffs because the ideological element is absent in both russian and u s foreign policies today this may sound strange since most people consider u s president george w bushs foreign policy to be extremely ideological after all the global advancement of democracy has been his principal credo for nearly eight years in practice however exporting democracy is less an ideology than it is realpolitik at its core an instrument for attaining geopolitical dominance around the globe the united states had to immediately adjust to the burden of global leadership after the collapse of the soviet union when it declared itself the victor in the cold war a victory that it was not entirely ready for

6606080 first we would like to assure you that brother stands behind our product and the information disclosure that we provide to the consumer it is always our policy to provide such information to consumers to help them understand both the product and the conditions under which the product operates
6606081 to address your specific question regarding ink volume the rated yield for each cartridge follows the industry standard of that period which was based on 5 page coverage
6606082 importantly there is a technical and performance reason for why the small amount of ink is remaining in a cartridge that is identified as empty as mentioned in the user manual even though the machine informs you that an ink cartridge is empty there will be a small amount of ink remaining in the ink cartridge it is necessary to keep some ink in the ink cartridge to prevent air from drying out and damaging the print head assembly by doing so the machine is protected and consistent print quality is ensured to satisfy the consumer in effect remaining ink should not be viewed as waste but as brothers affirmative action to provide ongoing high quality output and performance of the machine

6606085 ive been in the supplies industry for 30 years and 7 years ago developed my own web site officesupplyoutfitters com to sell aftermarket and compatible replacement alternatives why because inkjet and toner cartridges were appallingly high priced if that werent enough the printer manufacturers are now using new technology to get you to buy more than you need now some of the printer manufacturers are using chips on their cartridges to prevent aftermarket suppliers from being able to remanufacture their cartridges
6606086 just have to add my 2 cents to this in addition to my raging fury with hp for installing mini ink cartridges in new printers that will print a test page and then force you to buy full sized ink cartridges right out of the gate the hp officejet pro k850 forces me to change practically full cartridges because it says they have expired this machine takes 4 high yield tanks of ink at about 80 to replace

6606187 currently only four per cent or 65 000 trips are made by the coast community on public transport and with rapid transit it is projected to grow to 10 per cent by 2026
6606188 by making public transport faster more efficient and more reliable this project is estimated to take up to 40 000 car trips off the roads that will have a significant effect on future congestion and avoiding gridlock

6606200 president bush zei dat de verenigde staten willen dat rusland in overeenstemming met het akkoord zorgt voor de terugtrekking van zijn troepen en een einde maakt aan hun staat van beleg in georgi
6606201 there is a possibility he may be acquitted of these offences
6606202 there shouldnt be a pecuniary penalty order and money shouldnt be forfeited to the crown on that basis
6606203 we felt his time would be better spent on the ground here in washington state
6606204 mccains not polling too bad here nobody thinks hes going to win it but hes not as polarizing as george bush
6606205 those republicans that can make a claim of crossing party lines have always done really well in washington
6606206 he is the lord of the living not the dead
6606207 why do we still need witnesses we have heard it ourselves from his own lips what is your judgment

6606209 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6606210 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area

6606214 when hillary clintons name is placed in nomination it will take over the emotional onus of the convention
6606215 i think the clintons have already hijacked the convention and i cant wait to watch
6606216 im rooting for the medias tendency to focus on how the clintons have taken over obamas convention
6606217 what i hope happens is that there is a huge groundswell of support for sen clinton
6606218 remember the george h w bush convention in houston that was hijacked by pat buchanan buchanan gave a speech that as the late molly ivins wrote sounded better in the original german and remember buchanan had nothing like sen clintons delegate support
6606219 the result would be that the clintons ran the convention
6606220 and it would look like obama was only the nominee at the sufferance of the clintons
6606221 god forbid that obama would pick kansas gov kathleen sebelius for his vice president that would really rile up the clintonistas
6606222 i have to give these guys an enormous amount of credit theyve run the smartest campaign that ive seen in a long time and they wont be doing anything stupid in denver
6606223 the worst possible thing from a democratic perspective would be a clinton obama flap but i dont think that will happen
6606224 if there is an angry liberal tone to the convention that makes voters feel like the democrats are out of step on the issues
6606225 i hope that theyre overconfident and arrogant enough that they do state where they stand on issues we want to raise taxes we really want to the cut military and we want to raise gas prices for the good of the environment
6606226 what obama has to worry about is an acceptance speech that will be well delivered but empty of substance
6606227 that would play right into mccains hands that would solidify the impression that obama has an engaging personality but theres nothing beneath it

6606229 world golf foundations first tee program even though justice department staffers had rated the program 47th on a list of 104 applicants the allegations were first reported earlier this year by the trade journal youth today current and former justice department employees allege that ojjdp administrator flores ignored the staff rankings in favor of programs that had political social or religious connections to the bush white house the honorary chairman of the first tee program is former president george bush
6606230 research based mentoring initiative designed to increase the resiliency and protective factors of at risk youths through a comprehensive intergenerational approach
6606231 resolution as it stands now would not be supported by my government
6606232 why should we put the council in the position of enshrining something thats not being adhered to
6606233 youve got to take care not to leave too quickly
6606234 its important because i cant do much for myself anymore and the food is great and just the right size and everything
6606235 weve never felt the pinch weve felt this summer in reference to not having enough volunteers to deliver meals
6606236 were trying to figure out how we can offer some sort of incentives to help get our volunteers back
6606237 but i just dont know the economy has just affected them so much thats its hard very hard on them
6606238 but that was when gas was a lot cheaper than it is now
6606239 so not only are we losing volunteers and are faced with higher gasoline costs we cant prepare enough meals to meet the demand thats out there
6606240 id say there are only two people the postman and the meals on wheels volunteers that most of these people see and depend on every day
6606241 thats why we like to say we deliver more than a meal every day weve given them some human contact which is just as important
6606242 for the amount of good this program does its not a lot of work
6606243 hasbro and ea planned their moves very methodically and waited patiently for their chance to strike
6606244 perhaps ea felt that it could not compete with scrabulous other than by taking it out at the knees

6606254 hes just like us he is a normal guy he could care less about the show the business the publicity the l a scene he doesnt care he wants someone who is going to make him happy and be in love for the true reasons
6606255 jason needs that girl who is ready for the life that he is ready for
6606256 you know he has ty it has to be a woman that loves children because that child is the cutest thing in the whole world

6606274 its a little striking that no one ever thought of the fact in washington d c that food might be more important than fuel
6606275 input prices are through the roof i dont have any idea what seeds going to be next year
6606276 were moving more product than ive ever moved but my margins are not greater because input costs have gone up
6606277 id like corn to be cheaper holy cow thats my biggest cost
6606278 he can repudiate his commitment to workers rights and sign a contract with nike that would guarantee that uw apparel is produced in sweatshop conditions of the next 10 years or he can listen to concerned students and their allies and recommit to a comprehensive set of labor stands that would ensure that uws nike apparel would be produced under fair conditions
6606279 without a stronger mandate from the president we could not continue to function
6606280 emmert needs to work directly with students and take their thoughts into consideration rather than by proxy
6606281 its a very messy and complicated world out there in terms of brands and factory owners and different countries and labor laws in those countries
6606282 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6606283 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6606284 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6606285 release of this video would do nothing more than produce another stack of soundoffs
6606286 its a travesty and it speaks to the complete weirdness of the law in washington
6606287 you can beat somebody to death and be charged with manslaughter
6606288 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6606289 how to add 2 hours to your day lessons in efficiency

6606295 they reviewed the sentencing statute compared it with the facts in the case consulted with the boulder police department and talked with the chase family and based on that the decision was made
6606296 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses he told sky news
6606297 what were seeing here is the legacy of neglect from the previous government
6606298 this industry has been left on automatic pilot pretty much since 2002
6606299 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6606300 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6606301 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6606302 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6606303 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6606304 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6606305 the brain was damaged bruised and it takes a long time for the brain to heal
6606306 so as it does heal he will definitely get out of this state of confusion
6606307 compared to what he was even two weeks ago his confusion is so much better and his memory is so much better
6606308 obviously just number one was for him to survive and then after that i got selfish and wanted him to be 100 per cent
6606309 he couldnt even tell me that hed live hes a very lucky boy
6606310 considering that he got hit by a tram hes doing very well i think

6606320 the plane left the gate for takeoff at 1 20pm but then the pilot apologised and said he would have to return because of a technical problem
6606321 an hour later we went to take off i heard a horrible noise and the next thing i remember was being flung from the aircraft
6606322 i must have passed out but woke when there was a loud explosion i could hardly move but lifted my head and saw other bodies around me
6606323 there was incredible heat and i heard people and children crying for help i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6606324 i remember noticing there was something wrong with the plane then i remember lifting my head up and the plane had no roof
6606325 we thought if anyone survived the crash they would be burned to death inside it was horrible like a film it is a miracle anyone survived
6606326 with the good feelings there is going to be a lot of public support for continuing the policy of winning gold medals
6606327 the decision might have to go into the top leadership of china
6606328 the chinese program really pares down athletes to whether or not they can win a gold medal
6606329 once theyre zeroed in on a couple of people they put everything into these people
6606330 is a different kind of program that were not used to
6606331 the other ones came from just picking off medals here and there
6606332 when they start taking some of our swimming medals away from us its going to be difficult to compete
6606333 every credit card transaction will now be reported to the irs
6606334 it is geared at the transactions between the merchants and the credit card company and not looking at any one individual consumer
6606335 if the irs through this system gets information on a merchant that shows x amount of credit card sales and their statistics show that type of merchant probably has 80 of their business done on credit card sales and total reported revenue doesnt seem to mesh up it probably will result in audits
6606336 merchants anticipating this may ensure their reporting is complying with what the credit card issuers are reporting to the irs
6606337 the credit card companies or the banks are going to have to build this reporting system out that cost is likely to be passed on to the small business owner
6606338 its not any relationship to what the tax would be they pay 28 tax on their net income not on their gross
6606339 if theres a snafu or mistake thats a big hit to cash flow and cash flow is a big issue for small business owners especially right now
6606340 this burdensome unfunded mandate would impose hundreds of millions of dollars in costs on the business community in order to comply with this mandate the payment card industry and its third party processors would be required to fundamentally redesign card processing systems that were developed to accommodate the efficient and reliable processing and settlement of transactions between consumers and merchants
6606341 their decision will put the lives and the health of australians at risk from influenza
6606342 if people cannot get this drug in time for it to make them better they are going to suffer and theyre going to die
6606343 the department of health and ageing is not only failing to promote the flu drugs it actually seems to be going out of its way to prevent their use
6606344 how many people died from flu last year how many were ill and how much economic loss occurred because the department had not bothered to develop an effective procedure for flu victims in the community to get tamiflu in time for it to abort their infection and allow them to recover
6606345 we have complied with everything the irs has asked us to do
6606346 its not yours its gods and youre not going to get it and thats something ill go to prison over
6606347 if they suspect tax avoidance its going to be a big sweep
6606348 this is a point where church board members might be concerned regardless the process is very painful
6606349 we had no personal assets of any significance in 1981 and still have none we do not own a home we do not have an investment retirement savings accounts

6606391 i havent heard that shes doing it and i havent heard that she isnt
6606392 post i decided to post something that i learned this year which had a similar effect on me
6606393 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6606394 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6606395 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6606396 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6606397 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6606398 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6606399 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
6606400 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
6606401 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they all get geed up and then they start fighting

6606405 this is our fourth roland 700 press in the last 11 years
6606406 it replaced a 4 color press with coater that was only four or five years old several years ago 75 percent of our folding carton business was 4 color or less today it is just the opposite as we add more higher end work of 5 colors or more we couldnt keep the 4 color press busy but we have plenty of work for an older roland 700 6 color press and this one
6606407 this new press can help us do that in many ways
6606408 looking at our current business and what we need to handle it the flexibility along with time and waste saving features designed in the roland 700 hi print made a lot of sense we have all of the quick change features for faster make readies and less paper waste
6606409 perfecting and the in line uv coater is a huge plus for us
6606410 it will cut plenty of time off many projects and well be doing it all in house the other automated features on the roland 700 also save a lot of time plus substrate for start up which means less waste handling and lower disposal costs too on the energy side if a job now goes through in one pass instead of three youre using considerably less energy to deliver each job

6606437 official or not i know what i did and that is the important thing
6606438 i think they are going to it way too many times its the original story that defined john mccain that still when you read it in his book faith of my fathers when you read about it in the nightingales song you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy and i think he wisely for many years stayed away from it as a political tool he really did but now it not only defines him its become a crutch in the campaign and i think he is in danger of trivializing it by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use
6606439 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6606440 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
6606441 the worst dining experience of my career as a food writer
6606442 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6606443 the worst dining experience of my career as a food writer
6606444 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6606445 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6606446 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6606447 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6606448 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6606449 the worst dining experience of my career as a food writer
6606450 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6606451 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6606452 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6606453 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6606454 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6606455 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6606456 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6606457 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6606458 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia

6606469 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6606470 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6606471 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6606472 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6606473 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go

6606478 its my job to make sure he had it secure
6606479 i thought he had it secure so i take the blame for this
6606480 im telling people the stick had a mind of its own
6606481 it wasnt me it wasnt torri it was electronic it had a little bug inside of there it jumped out it wasnt either one of our faults it was just unfortunate
6606482 i mean the whole games hasnt been going quite as planned for team usa in track and field
6606483 i thought the baton was secure i guess it wasnt its definitely very heartbreaking
6606484 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6606485 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6606486 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6606490 either way its a constant agitation of society much like former president bill clintons wag the dog antics to keep the heat off of his personal indiscretions
6606491 in america you dont take public referenda on voting rights womens rights the right to have a society free of prejudice civil unions are as offensive to gay people as separate facilities would be to other groups based on who they are
6606492 this was a game that was bigger than me and that whole fiasco said hammon who had little impact in her 24 minutes
6606493 rocky played after the anthems and russian fans who vastly outnumbered the tiny pockets of american supporters were in no mood for sportsmanship
6606494 rossiya as their team seized an early five point lead
6606495 we were rushing a little bit on offense and not taking care of the basketball said u
6606496 we hung our hat on our defense and we knew if we got a little bit of a run and got a cushion wed maintain it
6606497 un american a remark widely attributed to her and said she would greet hammon when she next saw her
6606498 i dont know that i have strong thoughts on it any more
6606499 becky made a great business decision this was a great opportunity for her to get to the olympics i hold no grudge
6606500 what ive learned since my first strong statement is that im an old timer generations have changed and the cold war is a distant memory if its a memory at all for our players our players are going to russia to play chinese players are coming to the wnba there are no borders anymore
6606501 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6606502 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6606503 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans
6606504 for the ninth time in the past two years moving water industries categorically denies the highly inventive scurrilous and patently false allegations by the would be whistleblower maria garzino
6606505 it would put all of the silver medalists into the gold position which in and of itself creates all sorts of problems no one wants to be no 1 because the real no 1 was disqualified the fact remains that he won even though she is probably only 14
6606506 what is wrong with you people every time the american team doesnt win a sport that are supposed to win there always needs to be an investigation just accept that the girls got beaten fair and square by a chinese team that was better than them on that day
6606507 the only way the chinese advance is thru cheating lying and chicanery this was evident at the opening ceremony these games whould be called the faking olympics not the beijing olympics
6606508 with the judges they had at the olympics would it really have mattered
6606509 by almost any business measure the knight ridder newspapers in philadelphia would be deemed a success since 1995 profit margins at the philadelphia inquirer and the philadelphia daily news have more than doubled reaching close to 19 percent after years of single digit doldrums good absolutely good enough not for long for 2001 the target margin is 21 percent and now there is talk about 5 percent budget cuts at the papers if not more anxiety is as plentiful as oxygen in the inquirers newsroom
6606510 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work

6606512 these press guys they get seated first at the macworld shows they get seated first in the prime seats they arent cutting in line

6606514 the moment when the olympic flag passes from one city to another is always a ceremony of great poignancy at the close of any olympic games
6606515 these stamps are made all the more special as they not only celebrate a wonderful games in beijing but they whet our appetite for what is to come as the uk takes over the honour
6606516 this tour has just started and already the chaos has begun
6606517 we ended up making it to montreal just in time for our video shoot for
6606518 after that we headed off to the first show of the summer slaughter tour in quebec city regardless of the insanity of nine different bands with too much gear the show went off without a hitch and i think everyone had a killer time thanks to all our fans that came out and showed support its already apparent that all the bands are wicked cool and that this will be a killer tour were looking forward to the rest of the shows
6606519 godhate has spent the last year recruiting new members and writing a whole new album and since the 14th of august godhate are in the working process of this new album the recordings will be done in co operation with dino medanhodzic also known as the guitarist in carnal forge from elastic studio as engineer this album is scheduled for just three weeks and so far things are looking real good the album will be released if all goes well this fall
6606520 last but not least our label metal fortress told us we need bigger labels that are ambitious enough to support us all the way through and a label that are at the same level as the band metal fortress will take the position as the bands management until further on this means we are in a phase to evolve from our label to a greater base we encourage serious labels to get in touch
6606521 is accounted for and none has been compromised a thorough inventory will be a part of this stand down
6606522 the issue of properly safeguarding biological agents and toxins has become a concern following recent developments in the 2001 anthrax case
6606523 while navy standards already meet or exceed those of civilian laboratories that handle the same materials the navy is taking proactive steps to critically self assess its programs
6606524 alive in baghdad 4 other us citizens receive 10 day jail sentence
6606525 because if the attorney is doing all the work then im wondering how much of that fee is going to you
6606526 well i work with the clients i put a package together and follow up with the lender
6606527 but a few minutes ago you mentioned that everything is handled by attorneys
6606528 well the loan servicing departments are really busy and by paying our 3500 fee you have a 93 chance of getting your loan modified
6606529 can you remember a time when cares and troubles dropped from you like gentle spring rain in my music it is my hope that you can experience such a time again
6606530 aliens are not going to attack the world trade center what reason would they attack the world trade center that makes no sense at all
6606531 i think hes just using that as an excuse to help promote his game being it comes out so close to the remembrance of the attack
6606532 thats the way they want to celebrate it i think its disgusting
6606533 stanley should come here and see what the towers look like that hole that empty space he might have a different perspective
6606534 billy frontier is a space cowboy whos mission is to rid the galaxy of alien outlaws this is the most diverse 3d game youll find for the apple iphone ipod touch it is a combination of adventure game and arcade game with a whole lot of blood spewing action in between youll test your reflexes in duels see if you can outrun a stampeding herd of kanga cows half kangaroo half cow hunt down alien bandits in gun battles and blast catapulted critters out of the sky in the shooting gallery billy frontier is really four games in one dueling shootout stampede and target practice the graphics and audio are the best there is for an iphone game and if you like spaghetti westerns then youll love billy frontier because it is a spaghetti space western with all the fixins

6606536 por el momento las negociaciones por shevchenko est n en punto muerto el milan estaba interesado en traer al jugador cedido con opci n de compra pero el chelsea no acept porque pretende una venta y por eso las negociaciones han terminado
6606537 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6606538 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6606539 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6606540 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6606541 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6606542 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6606543 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6606544 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6606545 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6606546 knock knock at amp t here to set up your computer
6606547 a one stop shop because we already understand and support the network side we bring a new and better approach to end to end support and customer care

6606551 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6606552 obviously theres some real concerns out there weve seen an overall pullback in the market that we havent seen in some time
6606553 but the best retailers are taking advantage of this market theyre going out and making deals
6606554 obviously our occupancy has dipped a bit because of these but were actively working on those spaces
6606555 its unfortunate that some choose to leave markets but we have the relationships to put new tenants in there
6606556 were very fortunate casto itself is a very strong company and lakeside village is uniquely positioned in the lakeland polk county market
6606557 when things get tough it becomes all about fundamentals and posner has excellent fundamentals location access
6606558 a lot of those tenants are the only ones in the market so theyre able to pull from a very large region
6606559 i would say competition is healthy it just helps keep us on our toes
6606560 wait for me to hang up and then point your browser to my qik profile and ill give you a live tour using my nokia n75

6606566 his efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as the fight against al qaeda and extremist groups
6606567 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6606568 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign and if that is not respected then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition
6606569 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6606570 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6606571 i just want to emphasize well have agreement when we have agreement
6606572 we are talking about time horizons and this is a sign of confidence in the iraqi military and security that they are taking more and more responsibility
6606573 because our agreement has not been signed and finalized i wont be able to give you any specific dates
6606574 my presence can identify whether there are any final obstacles
6606575 to make sure that any timelines reflect what we believe can be done
6606576 the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6606577 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6606578 we need any witnesses to come forward so that a report can be put before the coroner to determine the next course of action
6606579 it may well be that this is dealt with under the inquest procedure
6606580 i know that there are some expectations to do something before the end of the year
6606581 bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach
6606582 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6606583 a much higher level of detail on both characters and environments
6606584 several times the young company was on the verge of going under but hard work overcame the difficulties and the business forged ahead
6606585 he had a gift for seeing his customers point of view and accommodating himself to their needs
6606586 he saw that consumer acceptance of wrigleys gum could be built faster by telling people about the benefits of the product through newspaper and magazine ads outdoor posters and other forms of advertising then as more and more consumers began to ask for and buy wrigleys chewing gum in the stores the storekeeper would naturally want to keep a sufficient stock of wrigley brands on hand

6606598 that word repeat is not used a bunch definitely not around lsu
6606599 recently i was at a theater watching the new batman
6606600 about nine little kids came up to me and they were arguing that i was ricky jean francois i had to show their mom my license a little girl started crying saying she couldnt believe i wouldnt give her my autograph
6606601 i told her im not ricky but i can get you ricky
6606602 i cant imagine that theres a more competitive league out there
6606603 i can assure you this team will not be defined by one player
6606604 i was always one or two of the guys sitting in the front of the team picture with my legs crossed and everybody else got to stand up that was me i know what it was like i think i give kids hope because youre small and not fast enough and people dont think you can jump high enough it doesnt matter if you have the will if you have the heart if you have the vision and the mindset that you can do it you can do whatever you want to do
6606605 my high school coach would parade me around when the recruiters came
6606606 it probably speaks to the kind of guy he was we were able to talk seriously about some of the issues what it came down to was that we agreed to disagree on the issues there was some respect there
6606607 but obviously you look at the life he lived and all the things he accomplished its pretty amazing
6606608 hes certainly made an impact in a lot of ways in the nfl
6606609 were going to have to get somebody else to step in and fill that void
6606610 gene definitely left a brilliant legacy that we all can kind of look up to and that we are all benefiting from
6606611 will be a partner with me in strengthening this economy for the middle class and working families
6606612 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me
6606613 the american people are still checking me out because i am relatively new
6606614 john mccain has been in the public eye for 25 years

6606616 its more or less the same time frame i announced two years ago
6606617 is not going to dazzle like the speech i made four years ago
6606618 im much more interested in laying out that choice clearly than i am in a bunch of high flying rhetoric
6606619 taking pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime
6606620 its a remarkable thing perhaps unequaled in modern history i dont think we have to shy away from the significance of that
6606621 will there be a handful of folks around the country who dont vote for me because of my race sure will there some who vote for me because of my race sure
6606622 folks like myself who are making a lot of money
6606623 ensure were not leaving a mountain of debt to the next generation
6606624 decide im going to be good for their pocketbook and good for their safety im going to win
6606625 and if they decide john mccain is going to do better at those things hes going to win
6606626 theres no doubt that the enthusiasm and grass roots energy we built carries with it its own dangers
6606627 were cutting through all the sizzle and getting to the steak
6606628 hes probably going to give a very impressive speech that will be very well delivered
6606629 im sure hell do a far better job than i could ever do i hope we can convey the fact that i am the most qualified to lead in both national security and domestic challenges
6606630 people want to know how were going to fix the problems
6606631 i was able in the primary to show that i have the necessary experience and talents to lead the country

6606636 we have great opportunities to get significant support in all groups

6606663 some press accounts have contained statements faulting the fbi for dr bruce ivins suicide we disavow such speculation
6606664 we believe that ms lieber acted out of concern for his welfare

6606710 tv recap big brother 10 week 6 eviction hoh updates
6606711 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it

6606713 wait a minute in just one year moonlighting ive developed two computers ive written a basic language ive done all the software needs id put in stuff nobody ever imagined in low cost computers colour and graphics and pixels
6606714 nope youve got to leave hewlett packard and decide by tuesday

6606716 i have been here for ten years and hes only been here for five i should be the new director
6606717 im the boss around here you do as i say and not as i do
6606718 where could i potentially be doing harm with my power
6606719 no one wants to tell you that your baby aint right
6606720 the best performance moments usually occur when a persons body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile
6606721 its a contradiction if you find that there is no discrimination implicitly that means there was a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for the reduction in pay
6606722 after her pay was reduced there was about a 20 000 difference between todaro and the only male associate at the firm
6606723 certainly one difference between the two is that ms moscarelli was fired and ms todaro was not her salary was cut by 25 percent
6606724 we are very pleased with the outcome and that our clients rights are vindicated
6606725 the firm made the decision to eliminate 15 administrative positions out of a total of more than 700 non legal staff firmwide
6606726 all of the positions eliminated were in philadelphia except one
6606727 the decision reflected the firms view that it could continue with the same very high level of service administratively while operating on a slightly leaner basis the positions involved were in information services real estate and facilities hr and finance
6606728 staff positions are definitely one area that tends to get first notice by law firms
6606729 the number of size adjustments going on in law firms is much more pervasive than is being reported
6606730 and now with our systems in place and being utilized every day by lawyers were able to respond quickly and effectively and do it with a leaner organization
6606731 does not mean necessarily that the partys attorney was competent or that the party would not have received a more favorable settlement had the partys incompetent attorney been competent
6606732 c ollateral estoppel does not bar peters actions against her former attorney and troyan
6606733 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6606734 consult not your fears but your hopes and dreams think not about your frustrations but about your unfulfilled potential concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in but with what is still possible for you to do
6606735 it is clear from the poor working class poor communities that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently than those who are poor
6606736 after catching two or three bluegill alyssa turns to me and says papa ive got to go to the bathroom
6606737 a few minutes later the float went under and i saw the water start boiling up i knew right then that i had my hands full with that fishing rod
6606738 she threw open the door and just threw it all over got the face chest and stomach and i mean that has to hurt
6606739 its definitely definitely creepy knowing that hes out there and what if hes mad now
6606740 i cant say theres a direct correlation between these places and these incidents
6606741 i think that in back of my mind i was hoping that one day i would feel well enough to see if the place was here
6606742 i was shocked it was amazing and 15 years later these people save the balloons and the card
6606743 my address is 3006 and my fire chiefs is 3007 scenic drive and we even had our own community split
6606744 you see a lot of deason signs and you see a lot of the chiefs signs
6606745 living across the street from your opponent i havent had any real problems with that
6606746 the way that owners are going all about this points directly to a lockout
6606747 ive made it clear to the owners that were not accepting a deal that pays us less than were already making
6606748 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it
6606749 we are finalizing plans that will walk board officials through the process of identifying the problem loading the affected memory cards and verifying that the votes are counted
6606750 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6606751 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6606752 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6606753 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6606754 when i pulled up a crowd of people surrounded the car and stared as if they were seeing extraterrestrial beings
6606755 instead of focusing on the burn victims the nurses kept repeating you drove them here
6606756 my daughter took the right decision at the right time
6606757 the moment when the olympic flag passes from one city to another is always a ceremony of great poignancy at the close of any olympic games
6606758 these stamps are made all the more special as they not only celebrate a wonderful games in beijing but they whet our appetite for what is to come as the uk takes over the honour
6606759 its a tragic end to a programme that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6606760 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life all he needed is a mothers milk
6606761 national economic trends have now fully impacted the illinois labor market
6606762 while many areas throughout the state continue to experience stable or moderate job growth local economies cannot provide enough opportunities to prevent increases in unemployment induced by national economic uncertainty
6606763 such arrangements typically appeal to people harboring strong doubts about the stability of the international monetary system and who believe they are insulating their wealth from a global collapse by tying it to the value of gold
6606764 michael mixon and connected to e bullion at all his company was a ponzi type high yield scam flat electronic data interchange fedi and it appears he was just using e bullion to accept funds during his solicitation that is what i get from the material
6606765 we are pleased our clients have the certainty of a favorable resolution to this unprecedented liquidity crisis
6606766 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6606767 i want to dedicate my victory today to all the victims and all the families of the victims in the flight in madrid yesterday and send them all of my support and everything of me that i can help for them
6606768 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today
6606769 its good because i won the match without playing my best level
6606770 i dont think i could have asked for a better week before the u s open
6606771 in the second set i just fought one point at a time everything was going my way
6606772 she doesnt give you any points especially on hardcourts she just played better than me today
6606773 it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i was fighting until the end thats why i won
6606774 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6606775 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6606776 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6606777 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6606778 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6606779 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6606780 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6606781 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6606782 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6606783 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6606784 the rule is that disproportionate attacks are prohibited in other words if you have your eye on a military target and there is likely to be civilian damage excessive in relation to the expected military gain you dont fire
6606785 we have numerous stories of ossetian forces roving around ethnic georgian villages running around looting homes torching them
6606786 youre just a liberal yankee who doesnt understand the reality of life in texas
6606787 the truth made clear while the esv sb boasts of
6606788 he just has a kindness about him and he has beautiful eyes
6606789 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6606790 its going to be a lot of work for the guys and theyll be exremely tired
6606791 im not going to be whining if the car is pushing or loose im just going to go for it
6606792 were right there and not losing faith we still have a chance he needs to be more careful than us because he has more to lose and im always very comfortable on this type of circuit
6606793 i told him well make it comfortable enough for him to win

6606796 for every dollar they lose in print ad revenue newspapers online operations industrywide are recapturing maybe 14 cents
6606797 these are companies trying to keep their heads above water
6606798 cutting costs in the face of declining revenues is a survival mechanism not a buy signal
6606799 the business model is taking on water and the companies will change because they have to
6606800 but cutting back on employees or eliminating sections to cut down on newsprint are not going to be the moves that change things for newspapers theyre just helping them stay afloat right now
6606801 microsoft expected a demand for the 60gb model but it just hasnt come yet
6606802 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6606803 weve chosen to partner with microsoft to compete effectively with rim
6606804 even with the growth in this market 90 percent of the market doesnt have a smartphone it doesnt make sense to fight over the 10 percent
6606805 we want to reach out to people who dont have a smartphone not people who already love rim
6606806 going forward for premium fully featured devices wi fi is a requirement
6606807 weve gone so far off topic that if we were in a car and this topic was in the us wed be in beijing by now
6606808 i wonder how many times i have to zap this adorable pixel creature with lightning to kill it
6606809 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6606810 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6606811 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6606812 if somebody wants to come out and do a 1 33 theres probably nothing i can do about it
6606813 thats the good and the bad at the same time about our sport is that youre in your own lane its not a combative sport i cant reach over and knock the guy over if he starts going faster than me all i can do is try to go as fast as i can

6606861 everyone has to learn so that they can one day teach
6606862 it looks very nice and wide with a smooth surface it also looks like good fun track but we wont really know until tomorrow as there is big difference between walking a track and driving it at almost 300 km h learning a new track to start with is not too difficult and just takes a few laps to find out which way the corners go but after that you continue to learn small details about it i dont find it too hard to deal with a new track the only place i found any bumps is where the track goes over a bridge and theres one in the middle of a corner that might have an effect but apart from that it looks like the people here have done a very good job
6606863 of course i would have liked to have won more races but the opportunities were sometimes missed
6606864 but i am still in a good position in the championship and while the season so far could have been better it could also have gone the other way and been a lot worse i am hoping we get some good results for the remaining races to get back to where we should be the main issue has been getting stuck behind other drivers in the race after having had a bad qualifying session if we can sort that out we should be fine
6606865 coming up now are some circuits that i really like
6606866 we have good speed in our package and the important thing is to make sure we use that speed in qualifying because that is the crucial point of the weekend getting the car to work the way i want is just a matter of some very small things but thats enough to make the difference some times we get it right but unfortunately we seem to have got it wrong more often so far now we have found a solution that helps to make the car a bit easier to drive in qualifying even though it looks as though you can overtake here it is still very important to try and start from the front but in general i am not worried about the rest of the season the pressure is always there but at the moment it is not getting bigger as the championship gets nearer the end then there will be maybe more pressure not to make any mistakes
6606867 i had a good time during the break just staying at home enjoying time with my friends and family
6606868 ive been watching a lot of the olympics enjoying whatever sport was on and for me the highlights have been the sprint races the one hundred and two hundred metres especially
6606869 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6606870 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6606871 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans

6606876 the chinese government got the united states to recognise the east turkestan independence movement which is a movement of uighurs in xinjiang who would like to have there own independent state classified as a terrorist organisation
6606877 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6606878 to be the best business and leisure hotel company in the world we are able to accomplish this by ensuring our energy is high our commitment total and that responsibility is shared by all consequently we always exceed our guests expectations
6606879 influence employees behaviours in desirable ways and consequently increase the probability that the organisation will achieve its goals
6606880 management control problems can lead to large losses and possibly even to organisational failure
6606881 they dont have to get too bogged down in the numbers when they should really be concentrating on getting their hotel off to a fantastic start whats more it also helps us home office executives to get an early view of how a hotel is doing compared with our project appraisal after all we need to know if we made the right decision to spend on the property or whether we need to get our resignation letters ready
6606882 but given how close you are to opening lets persevere with the first year projection figures on her return to manchester nancy immediately briefed philip bruce phil the nebos finance is director regarding her budget discussions with bob campania
6606883 clearly home office want us to adopt the project appraisal income projection for our first budget bob made it plain that he feels we have more than enough to deal with in opening the new property and also that he and the other home office executives want to make sure we are at least in line with the companys original investment plans
6606884 as im sure we are all going to be more than a little busy over the next few months i know i certainly am
6606885 you should all have had enough time by now to consider the nebos year 1 feasibility income projection
6606886 in addition youve probably also heard that bob campania at home office is strongly advising us to adopt this statement as our first year budget
6606887 im certainly all for saving time when it comes to budgets
6606888 in fact i read somewhere that budget plans can often take somewhere around 4 months to prepare and require more than 20 per cent of a managers time what a waste surely weve much more important things to be doing particularly just now
6606889 and especially when we dont have any prior year information to work with
6606890 starting a budget completely from scratch will take us ages to do
6606891 ive always found budgets to be a time consuming bureaucratic inefficient and very expensive nightmare sorry phil the whole budgetary control idea in large companies like comoro seems to be more about fitting into a corporate jigsaw puzzle for the benefit of the executive directors rather than providing the individual hotel or department with a realistic and useful control tool
6606892 that looks like some votes for implementing the year 1 income projection as our first budget
6606893 is everyone else in agreement or has anybody got any major anxieties
6606894 well im more than a little bothered that were being asked to commit to a budget that is essentially being handed down from home office
6606895 how can we be sure that the numbers are reasonable after all what do home office really know about the hotel business here in manchester surely we are far more in tune with local conditions and i dont just mean us the management team i think we should use the budget control system to regularly bring together all nuevo management and staff that way everyone can share their knowledge of whats going on both inside the hotel and outside in the local market
6606896 at my last hotel all managers and staff participated in the budget process and i do mean all yes it took up more time but that was easily outweighed by a massive increase in employee commitment and loyalty which seems to me to be right in line with comoros stated mission we even managed to link key budget targets to individual staff appraisal goals
6606897 like james and steve im all for encouraging employee participation in the budget process however i think this traditional so called responsibility accounting format can lead to some very damaging inward looking and department centred attitudes
6606898 i dont know if marco and roy hold the same view based on their past comoro experience
6606899 shouldnt we really be concentrating on designing a budget which supports an outstanding seamless service always exceeding our guests expectations
6606900 great guest service is about all of us working together its not enough to just look after our own particular areas
6606901 i actually have reservations about overly emphasising employee involvement in the budget process
6606902 we tried getting everyone involved in budgets at my last place too but a lot of staff just dont have the necessary training while others just want to clock in do the job clock off and then pick up their wages at the end of the month quite a few of my housekeepers even told me in no uncertain terms i might add that budgets are managements responsibility after all isnt that what we get paid for
6606903 i must say ive always been more than a little uneasy about participatory budgeting too
6606904 there are always arguments for and arguments against we just need to find the right balance
6606905 and although i know theyre important im worried that if we adopt this income projection well end up only watching out for the financials we could run a serious risk of ignoring other vital issues like employee development and morale or guest service and satisfaction levels sorry to say this phil but budgets always seem to me to be about the accountants keeping costs down rather than looking to manage value up
6606906 restaurants live or die by the quality of the food and wine their staff and the ambience
6606907 is this year 1 income projection to be treated as a final fixed plan
6606908 im sure all of us here are very aware that the nature of the hospitality industry means that information can become out of date very quickly where i worked last we stopped using averaged annual budgets like this income projection we even stopped flexing budgets to try to reflect actual activity levels too instead we developed rolling forecasts that incorporated only a few critical business factors these could be prepared quickly and they were easy to update when required end result a fast efficient cost effective and really useful planning tool that consistently kept us looking towards the future
6606909 yes wed started doing something similar at my previous company too
6606910 as we only had to keep an eye on a handful of critical targets we could really get on with running the business rather than having to keep on filling out endless budget reports sorry again phil
6606911 thats how i used to manage the gym where i worked too
6606912 staff morale client satisfaction and the bottom line thats all i actively concentrated on
6606913 well i think weve all managed to have our say about budgets and weve certainly managed to generate a lot of interesting opinions and ideas

6606927 you know what college presidents say when theyre good you say rankings are very important and when theyre fair to middling you say theyre not important
6606928 i get very discouraged when parents come in and say well this is a top ranked school here and these other schools arent top ranked so why are you suggesting that my child look at them
6606929 to turn to a commercial ranking and say ok thats the one im going to go to and throw a dart at the highest level is just a very serious mistake
6606930 there is not a sufficient return of resources to washington county to justify the continued transit sales tax collection from our local businesses and their customers
6606931 the only thing that washington county will be able to do is keep the i 35 coach bus service to minneapolis operating for those three years after which unless metro transit takes on this route it may be discontinued resulting in a major political and transportation issue with the people and communities who have come to depend on this service

6606951 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6606952 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it

6606956 saya tidak mengatakan tuntutan itu keliru tapi menyoroti penerapan pasalnya karena itu harus seimbang antara artalyta dan urip
6606957 kalau artalyta ancaman hukumannya 5 tahun urip seharusnya juga paling tidak karena dia urip pegawai negeri ditambah sepertiga dari hukuman tersebut
6606958 12 e itu kalau tidak salah pemerasan dengan unsur paksaan tapi apa betul urip memaksa karena kalau saya baca dari keterangan saksi anggota tim penyelidik blbi itu pengacara glenn yang mendatangi mereka mereka nggak mau duit itu terus larinya ke urip
6606959 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

6606962 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6606963 kevin rudd should use his relationship with british prime minister gordon brown to convince the uk government to purchase the boomerang and donate it to australia in a gesture of friendship and to mark our shared heritage
6606964 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6606965 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6606966 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6606967 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6606968 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6606969 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6606970 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6606971 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavour for spammers
6606972 this means the actual response rates are much higher if you only count those emails that make it into a persons inbox
6606973 they have enabled spammers to push down their costs through economies of scale and eliminated the need for spammers to host their own spam servers as they simply take control of other peoples computers instead
6606974 recent fbi prosecutions of bot herders and investigations of message boards used by spammers suggests the going rate for spammers to send a million spam messages is as little as 5 10

6606987 beta blockers which relax the blood vessels by blocking certain nerve impulses are very versatile drugs these agents have some 20 different approved uses or indications besides lowering blood pressure they prevent anxiety and panic attacks a boon for entertainers and public speakers they are a mainstay in the treatment of angina irregular heartbeats and heart attacks
6606988 they control tremors they make withdrawal from alcohol more tolerable theyre effective in preventing migraine headaches two of them timolol and betaxotol are widely used to reduce elevated pressure in the eye due to glaucoma they are used in thyroid disorders one is even a vaginal contraceptive
6606989 these drugs should be avoided if you have chronic lung disease like emphysema bronchitis or asthma because they can induce bronchial spasm or they can worsen matters if your heart rate is slow to begin with they often cause impotence fatigue bad dreams and constipation

6606994 hypertension treatment clearly prevents death and illness data recently compiled from many studies show that for mild and severe hypertension combined antihypertensive drugs reduce the incidence of strokes 42 percent and heart disease 14 percent
6606995 in the past decade literally hundreds of new medications that are much easier to take have become available for the management of high blood pressure theres no longer any reason for you to fear their consequences if you cant tolerate a particular one there are several others on which to fall back
6606996 patients with side effects for one drug can usually be shifted to another that wont cause problems most of the drugs can be taken just once a day which adds to their convenience the goal is a drug regimen that lowers blood pressure below 140 90 mm hg while causing minimal side effects
6606997 a study published in the journal of the american medical association suggested that patients faced an increased risk of heart attack when their diastolic pressures fell below 85 mm hg the authors speculate that hypertensives with preexisting heart disease may need the hearts blood flow maintained above that level
6606998 its too bad that hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure because it just adds to the popular misconception that an elevated pressure will simply go away if you relax take it easy or use tranquilizers of course we should all try to deal with lifes problems calmly and with equanimity but if you suffer from true hypertension relaxing may lower your blood pressure a little but it will not drop down to normal
6606999 despite all the time and money spent on hypertension research we still dont understand why it happens in about 85 percent of cases in 10 to 15 percent a specific cause can be identified and usually involves kidney diseases an overactive or underactive thyroid or hormones secreted by the adrenal glands such as adrenalin noradrenalin cortisol or aldosterone some of these abnormalities can be dramati cally cured often by surgery e g removing a hormone secreting tumor or opening up a narrowed artery to the kidneys by balloon angioplasty or an operation your physician will know when and how to look for these relative ly rare conditions
6607000 there are also indications that use of oral contracep tives may contribute to increased blood pressure however this is more likely to occur in women who are overweight whose parents are hypertensive or who have other hyperten sive risk factors
6607001 you should exercise at least three times a week that will keep you in good shape and lower your blood pressure
6607002 its not true that everyone with hypertension must follow a salt free diet only certain individuals need to reduce their intake appreciably you can determine if youre one of them by going on a strict low salt diet for a few weeks if your blood pressure doesnt drop much then you are probably not salt sensitive and can enjoy the health advantages and pleasures of moderate salt intake without risk
6607003 for people trying to cut back on sodium hiding the salt shaker wont do the job about 70 percent of our sodium intake comes from processed foods so its important to read ingredient labels foods notoriously high in sodium include salted pretzels sausages pickles tomato juice and canned vegetables
6607004 i felt a little sluggish the first round but my body is woke up now
6607005 i felt controlled good start did exactly what i wanted to do in that race
6607006 if the blood vessel changes result in a decreased blood flow to the kidneys the kidneys will respond by releasing renin a hormone that causes an increase in blood pressure this further exaggerates the high blood pressure and this contributes to further blood vessel damage
6607007 persons with hypertension are urged to avoid high pressure situations and to learn to deal with stress biofeedback self hypnosis and meditation have proved useful for relieving stress and may help someone with hypertension
6607008 shedding a few pounds even without reaching ideal weight is still worthwhile since dropping blood pressure just a few points can lower the risk of heart attack and stroke and may also reduce the amount of antihypertensive medications needed
6607009 if youre a leader but no ones following youre just taking a walk
6607010 who do i have to be to motivate this person
6607011 how can i acknowledge these team members for their contribution
6607012 one man in three who take diuretics becomes impotent these agents often raise blood sugar which however returns to normal when you stop the drug they elevate uric acid levels in the blood and a high uric acid causes gout so that if youre vulnerable you may wake up one morning with a big red swollen painful toe they can upset an empty stomach so always have your diuretic with food or milk and then theres the matter of voiding diuretics are usually taken once a day either with breakfast or at bedtime a morning dose will keep you running all day taken at bedtime youre likely to get up every hour or so during the night to empty your bladder
6607013 statistically speaking when blood pressure has been lowered by a diuretic the incidence of heart attacks is not decreased we used to think that as long as your blood pressure stayed down no matter what medication was used the risk of heart attack was reduced that appears to be true for almost every antihypertensive drug except the diuretics in other words when blood pressure has been normalized by using diuretics the incidence of stroke is decreased but not the incidence of heart attacks
6607014 for all these reasons i prefer not to prescribe diuretics as first line drugs in white hypertensive patients however despite their drawbacks as antihypertensives they do have an important place in the treatment of heart failure whenever the body retains fluids and in certain sodium sensitive forms of high blood pressure especially common in blacks
6607015 although most antihypertensive drugs are usually continued for a lifetime i often stop them after a year to see if the patient can do without them not infrequently they can and even after drugs have been prescribed dont give up trying to lose weight because the thinner you are the fewer pills youll need side effects from any drug no matter how slight are dose related the less you take of any medication the better youll feel its also a good idea to join an exercise program if youve been cleared by your doctor to do so although exercise alone wont lower your blood pressure significantly neither will relaxation techniques at least not in my experience all these steps when taken together make medication work more effectively and in smaller doses
6607016 before starting any blood pressure medication always ask your doctor about possible side effects impotence diarrhea constipation frequent urination fatigue rash dizziness worsening of asthma a slow pulse and so on but dont let this litany scare you off its all potential not inevitable and very much a matter of individual response one person will tolerate a drug in large amounts while another reacts badly to a tiny dose also if youre being treated by more than one doctor because you have several different conditions make sure each of them knows what medications the others are prescribing drug interaction during the treatment of hypertension can be dangerous
6607017 high blood pressure ranks as the main cause of stroke because it weakens arteries in the brain paving the way for a rupture or blood clot it also contributes to coronary atherosclerosis the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries that nourish the heart which increases the risk of a heart attack it damages tiny vessels in the kidney that are needed for filtering the blood which can lead to kidney failure high blood pressure can also cause blindness by damaging vessels that provide blood to the eyes retina
6607018 the fact that high blood pressure is a silent killer and a major cause of death and disability was not always appreciated medical books published in the early 1900s didnt even list hypertension in the index and as recently as 1950 there were doctors who believed that as long as you were feeling fine high blood pressure didnt mean a thing the magnitude of the problem and its impact on health is now more realistically understood
6607019 in most instances mild hypertension can be controlled once you remove the factors that contribute to it since many of these factors are controllable modifying these through lifestyle changes will often result in an improve ment of a persons condition
6607020 two factors account for the shift away from drugs in treating mild hypertension uncertainty over whether their benefits outweigh their unpleasant and possibly harmful side effects which can range from fatigue and headaches to elevated cholesterol levels and recent evidence that nondrug approaches can often lower blood pressure to normal levels

6607064 if we can get him to the point where he can distinguish sounds and hear music hell proceed on the track hes been on since birth which is to make the best of what he has
6607065 the ultimate issue is how can this child provide for himself in the future
6607066 can he work can he marry can he provide for his family
6607067 he failed to do what he was educated to do

6607076 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6607077 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below

6607083 i looked at his call log tony and i both laughed at that we got a chuckle out of it
6607084 they have lots of reasons as to why they do that
6607085 but i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games

6607092 i think there are a lot of people out there in the industry who want to know that the government has handled it in the correct way
6607093 i think that it is a valid response but the main thing is research we dont know enough about the virus
6607094 were seeing really good work there with health and biosecurity there in queensland but we probably need to look at that more across a national framework and get that coordination happening at a national level and not just for things that are current but into the future
6607095 it may be that hendra will go away and we never see it again it may be that it could increase we just dont know

6607102 suntech has been in the market waning and about two months ago investors were wondering what kind of dynamic was underway in the solar pv market
6607103 the company has improved its polysilicon or wafer supply situation to 900 mw in 2009 thereby removing some of the companys past hurdles
6607104 if early trends continue pricing could end up falling in the 10 percent range for 09 coupled with a 15 percent decline in wafer costs next year could shape up to be another year of strong earnings power for solar pv companies in general and suntech in particular
6607105 in the meantime with stp shares trading at less than 16x our next 12 month eps estimate it appears that the long term risk reward is more than baked into the price

6607122 while c sections should always be available to a mother in need having a c section is risky to both mother and child
6607123 how many cases of children with hypoxia cerebral palsy are we willing to tolerate in return for simply reducing our c section rate
6607124 id agree with that but id also have to say that the number of c sections we do is still too high
6607125 the u s centers for disease control and prevention says we should have no more than 15 percent of low risk births delivered by c section
6607126 its important for us to know whats driving this increase
6607127 basically there were about 10 percent more c sections in puget sound than we would have expected to see when compared to the rest of the state
6607128 one of our remaining questions is why there was this geographical variation
6607129 i havent seen any evidence that would support those statements
6607130 what it really tells us is that we need more attention given to womens health in general
6607131 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6607132 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6607133 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6607134 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6607135 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6607136 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6607137 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6607138 the coldest winter i ever spent was the summer i spent in san francisco
6607139 going up against this defense has made us better were building were growing theyre starting to play fast because theyre starting to know what to do to me this is a great opportunity
6607140 is that we had a year in san diego our second year there where we had a lot of young players and led the league in rushing we were at a much lower point than this so weve got to find out what this unit has a chance to be great at in san diego we just kept growing personnel wise well continue to do that here but the starting point here its not as dirty of a job as you think
6607141 you kind of take it one day at a time and let things play out the season hasnt started yet and all of the guys that are out were going to get back thats the good news
6607142 it will tell you whats going on in your brain

6607150 the risk of disease associated with public drinking water has passed from the theoretical to the real
6607151 there are many important reasons why we need clean healthy water but theres one which has to rank as the most important of all
6607152 u s drinking water contains more than 2 100 toxic chemicals that can cause cancer
6607153 we want to make sure all the dogs are friendly enjoy the day and most of all is safe
6607154 socialization is important not every dog knows how to speak dog we are clean safe and fun
6607155 the emotional consequences are many but everything is surmountable better value and arming assume that a separation can bring with it several benefits intelligently handle it the
6607156 i prefer ace inhibitors because in my experience they have the fewest side effects for example unlike diure tics they dont raise your cholesterol or make you spend the better part of your life in the bathroom emptying your bladder unlike beta blockers they dont slow you down give you bad dreams worsen your asthma induce heart failure or drive you to reading porn magazines to help restore some interest in sex
6607157 there is another good reason to start with an ace inhibitor if it results in a dramatic drop in pressure then you know that renin is an important factor in the causation of your hypertension renin is the blood pressure raising hormone made by the kidneys that is blocked by the ace inhibitor excessive amounts of renin are produced when the arteries going to the kidneys are narrow ed so if you respond to an ace inhibitor it may be worth looking at these arteries to see if they can be dilated by balloon angioplasty
6607158 on the other hand when an ace inhibitor is not effective that more or less rules out renin and suggests instead a salt dependent type of hyper tension for which calcium antagonists or diuretics are more effective
6607159 calcium channel blockers are good antihypertensive drugs too they are also very effective against angina so that if youre lucky enough to have both angina pectoris and high blood pressure a calcium channel blocker fits the bill those currently on the market with more on the way are nifedipine nicardipine verapamil diltiazem and isradipine although they all lower blood pressure by dilating the arteries these agents are not interchangeable because each has certain specific characteristics that may be good for one person and not for another
6607160 their side effects include constipation dry mouth nausea cramps and in rare instances impotence nifedipine and related drugs are especially likely to cause heart palpitations and swelling of one or both feet and ankles constipation is more of a problem with verapamil like most other drugs any of these agents can cause a rash
6607161 the very first time you take them they can make you dizzy and even cause you to faint especially when you stand up suddenly from the lying position so always start treatment with any of these agents at bedtime and let your doctor know if they leave you lightheaded or feeling faint before you take a second dose
6607162 one medication i absolutely shun is reserpine it was widely used years ago when there was little else available to reduce blood pressure however it also affects nerves in the brain and causes severe depression that can be prolonged and life threatening especially in older persons

6607180 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6607181 we need a contract that takes water from colorado and gives it to my growing home state of arizona

6607200 so i went out of my way to maintain the trees and she ignored me
6607201 it is true the trees have been knocked down the trees were on ms tomlins property she was advised by the arborist to remove them because they were a hazard to people on the premises they could potentially tip over and kill someone her attorney and police were present at the time to make sure things were done accordingly
6607202 the arborist kept telling me youve got to take these trees down because a limb could fall down and people go by with their baby carriages walking their dogs riding their bicycles and it was just truly a hazard
6607203 even my insurance company said youve got to take these trees down or youre going to be criminally negligent

6607208 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6607209 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6607210 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6607211 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6607212 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6607213 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6607214 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6607215 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6607216 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6607217 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week

6607226 i truly believe our defense our team defense not just the back four but from the forward all the way to the goalkeeping are on the same page
6607227 we were organized this is the first time i can tell you that defense won this game today
6607228 i just knew i had to keep it low and hit it hard and it went in its an unbelievable feeling
6607229 brazil had control the whole game unfortunately we could not finish up
6607230 they have a bunch of superstars we have a team
6607231 we defend as a team and you keep defending and defending and defending it might be a forward who comes back and defense we stress that a lot the brazilians may beat two people but its very difficult to beat three
6607232 our back line just did an amazing job and they have all year for us
6607233 they have given us the ability with hope back there to being more creative and more offensive it is amazing to have them behind you and hope she was big all game
6607234 we looked at them and they are sitting on the ground and we re like theyre dying they had attacked us for 90 minutes lets attack them now
6607235 you could feel it every minute in the second half that we were getting stronger and especially going into overtime
6607236 we felt stronger we felt fit we felt like we could keep going after them
6607237 i was confident we were going to win the whole time
6607238 i was inspired by my team because once we scored that goal we were even more determined to not let them score we were already so determined yet we picked it up a notch
6607239 the more minutes together the better we played the last nine months this team has been finding its rhythm
6607240 the turning point was norway i dont know how many teams could come out of that game like we did
6607241 the team is definitely on a high right now believing was our whole statement throughout this tournament it didnt start out the way we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game it as a full team effort

6607244 top gear is a car show for grown ups that takes car culture seriously but not too seriously it is a show with broad appeal
6607245 when lewis hamilton did a test lap on top gear it got more viewers than the brazilian grand prix bernie was very impressed with the top gear proposition and there will be cross fertilisation between the show and the races
6607246 it had been intended that the new series of top gear would begin on 8 october given the circumstances its still too early to say when the series will return jeremy james and the top gear team have been completely focussed on richard and all that the wonderful staff of the leeds general infirmary have done for him
6607247 the priority for now must be ensuring richard makes a full recovery but we would not think of finalising plans for the next series without discussing it with everyone involved when it is suitable the team will do this and we will announce a new transmission date
6607248 a clone of the magnificent and simply unique jeremy clarkson richard hammond or james may were looking for australias own top gear faces
6607249 it would be perfectly consistent with all we know to say that there was a being who was responsible for the laws of physics
6607250 retailers awhile ago recognized how tough it was out there and how tough its going to be and went into defense mode
6607251 every lever you can pull to reduce your exposure and protect your profits you must do
6607252 its unacceptable we have been on this trajectory for a number of years
6607253 we dont see any reason for any optimism in the back half of the year
6607254 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6607255 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6607256 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6607257 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6607258 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6607259 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6607260 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6607261 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6607262 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6607263 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6607264 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6607265 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6607266 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6607267 that was the same way he operated as an executive
6607268 i think it was to my right magot fell to his left
6607269 he leaned over a bit with the gun in his hand he moved it to where it was pointing down to mr magot he shot him once
6607270 he was alone in the world without the support that held him together
6607271 wow that is high thats ridiculous especially with gas prices theyre so high already and theyre going to raise up the tax prices no
6607272 its like throwing a drowning person a cinderblock instead of a life preserver
6607273 its not a question of rich versus poor its a question of what in the short term is a more stable source of revenue to help get us through to better times
6607274 a sales tax or any kind of tax increase is going to hurt people in the pocketbook on the other hand if we dont do something to increase taxes were going to have to cut programs that affect those very same people hardest
6607275 as weve indicated there isnt any physical evidence to confirm that there was a death at all no fingerprint no dna no body scrapings no nothing
6607276 this really boils down to young men in the trenches having to decide whether or not to pull the trigger whether or not they can identify if somebody is the bad guy or the good guy and we think under the circumstances fallujah was a situation where there were very few good guys
6607277 we may have shown a loss this year but wow you should see some of the unpublishable stuff we have
6607278 i am also a member of the cincinnati 2600 group we get together once a month and listen to folks present on nifty things like sql injections and packet sniffing in early august we did lightning talks which are little 5 minute presentations instead of the usualy 30 60 minute format i

6607357 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6607358 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6607359 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place

6607374 root cause of these unfortunate incidents may be viewed as a simple misinterpretation of the effects and subsequent actions by various sectors of the filipino society on the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain agreed upon by the government and the milf in the pursuit for a lasting peace

6607381 agribusiness firms are already spending millions to defeat proposition 2 and they hardly needed an illegal infusion of check off funds authorized by the usda to supplement their political campaign

6607434 from our due diligence of mango we found that what they had is one fifth of what is available in the world market
6607435 as compared to the international players in the market we beleive that mango has two distinct advantages first is the amount of memory that they use and second is the amount of processing power this technology takes

6607451 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6607478 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

6607518 starting at the top the coastal carolina tournament is typically a good tournament we dont know the opponents but we expect to play other top 75 programs there and coastal is always good weve got maryland back on the schedule which is exciting because well have four acc games our stetson trip will be a challenging trip they are typically in the top 75 every year and seem to be in the ncaa tournament on a fairly regular basis after that the only new team is mount st marys its a fairly easy trip and they were in the ncaa tournament last year

6607521 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made

6607525 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items

6607578 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

6607602 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6607603 national home for the jewish people is not equivalent to making palestine a jewish state
6607604 state could not be erected without the gravest trespass upon the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine
6607605 that jews should be driven out of europe or that they should not be permitted to live again in these countries without discrimination contributing their ability and talent toward rebuilding the prosperity of europe
6607606 examine political economic and social conditions in palestine as they bear upon the problem of jewish immigration and settlement therein
6607607 who had been the victims of nazi and fascist persecution
6607608 jew shall not dominate arab and arab shall not dominate jew in palestine which shall be neither a jewish state nor an arab state palestine is a holy land sacred to christian to jew and to moslem alike and because it is a holy land palestine is not and can never become a land which any race or religion can justly claim as its very own
6607609 the rights and interests of moslems jews and christians alike
6607610 nothing can be more superficial and nothing can be more wrong than that the sufferings of russian jewry ever were the cause of zionism the fundamental cause of zionism has been and is the ineradicable national striving of jewry to have a home of its own a national center a national home with a national jewish life
6607611 the zionist movement is a revolutionary program organized to bring about a radical and fundamental change in the status of the jews the world over the sooner the world knows it the better
6607612 the central problem of the homeless and stateless jewish people had been left untouched
6607613 educated to go back to our traditional position of asylum
6607614 we are at home plate that little island and it was during the second blitz that he visited england on a properly representative program of a world immigration budget will match the united states up to 150 000
6607615 150 000 to england 150 000 to match that in the united states pick up 200 000 or 300 000 elsewhere and we can start with half a million of these oppressed people
6607616 margaret cant you get me a jewish pope i cannot stand it any more i have got to be careful that when stevie wise leaves the white house he doesnt see joe proskauer on the way in
6607617 nothing doing on the program we cant put it over because the dominant vocal jewish leadership of america wont stand for it
6607618 they are right from their point of view the zionist movement knows that palestine is and will be for some time a remittance society they know that they can raise vast sums for palestine by saying to donors there is no other place this poor jew can go but if there is a world political asylum for all people irrespective of race creed or color they cannot raise their money then the people who do not want to give the money will have an excuse to say what do you mean there is no place they can go but palestine they are the preferred wards of the world
6607619 i was thrown out of parlors of friends of mine who very frankly said morris this is treason
6607620 39 he ran into the same reaction amongst all jewish groups and their leaders
6607621 a deep genuine often fanatically emotional vested interest in putting over the palestinian movement
6607622 who are little concerned about human blood if it is not their own
6607623 facilitate full immigration to the united states under existing quota laws
6607624 in a number equivalent to a part of the total quota numbers unused 41 during the war years
6607625 by pressing for an exodus of jews from europe by insisting that jewish d p s do not wish to go to any country outside of israel by not participating in the negotiations on behalf of the d p s and by refraining from a campaign of their own by all this they the zionists certainly did not help to open the gates of america for jews in fact they sacrificed the interests of living people their brothers and sisters who went through a world of pain to the politics of their own movement
6607626 the jewish conference is alive only when there is something in the air which has to do with a commonwealth in palestine and it is asleep when it concerns rescue work for the jews in the diaspora
6607627 if united states jews had put as much effort into getting d p s admitted to this country as they put into zionism a home could have been found in the new world for all the displaced jews of europe
6607628 plans to move jews to palestine should be but part of larger plans to empty these camps of all refugees jew and otherwise
6607629 admitting that the jews of europe have suffered beyond expression why in gods name should the fate of all these unhappy people be subordinated to the single cry of statehood i cannot rid myself of the feeling that the unfortunate jews of europes d p camps are helpless hostages for whom statehood has been made the only ransom
6607630 it ill behooved zionist sympathizers to shed crocodile tears over the displaced persons
6607631 how can you be so cruel as to prevent those poor refugees from finding a home
6607632 imposition of a jewish nationality upon the inhabitants of palestine as a whole
6607633 the rights and position of other sections of the population be not prejudiced
6607634 jews and arabs would be as palestinian as english and scottish in britain are british
6607635 i can assure you that palestine jewry will as its representative bodies have declared go to the utmost limits of its power to cut out root and branch this evil from its midst
6607636 to resume active cooperation with the mandatory authority in the suppression of terrorism and of illegal immigration and in the maintenance of that law and order throughout palestine which is essential for the good of all including the new immigrants
6607637 every time you let go with your guns at the british betrayers of your homeland the jews of america make a little holiday in their hearts
6607638 i did reach a stage however in meeting the jews separately when things looked more hopeful
6607639 49 bevin was referring to the day of atonement plea of president truman to admit 100 000 refugees
6607640 if the president did not issue a statement a competitive statement would be issued by dewey
6607641 when we have to stand up and be counted you have not told congress so they would hear one unmistakable voice
6607642 congressman javits of manhattan suggests a congressional junket to palestine to foster the establishment of a jewish commonwealth
6607643 there will be no aid for the british policy in greece and turkey unless they follow the united states lead on palestine
6607644 you were just babies in the war like the ones upstairs
6607645 but youre not going to write it that way are you
6607646 youll pretend you were men instead of babies some of those other glamorous war loving dirty old men and war will look just wonderful so well have a lot more of them and theyll be fought by babies like the babies upstairs

6607657 i dont think his inconsistencies are anywhere near where they were last year
6607658 its more of a release point issue its not as much mechanics as its just visualization and a feeling of getting connected with the catcher and turning the ball loose
6607659 i dont think an outside arm is first of all available or anything that wed pursue right now we have some young power arms right now in the minors that we could look at in september
6607660 even with the current historically affordable mortgage rates news continues to show signs of weakening in the housing sector

6607682 i dont see it being a mainstream device in this form that said its certainly beyond a gimmick game issues aside its uncanny
6607683 when the item on screen did what i thought it to do it was surreal this is science fiction stuff emotiv has jumped the first hurdle in simply making the device now they have to make it work with most games if they do this could hit the jackpot
6607684 we headed from there to a press conference about the emotiv headset a device that reads your thoughts emotions and facial expressions the event was almost a complete train wreck mainly because the douchebags in the audience refused to disconnect themselves from dork headquarters all those wireless signals in the room were messing up the headsets reception

6607728 his effort to strip away the finery of objects and events and to exist only in the balm of desolation was a failure the experiment had only resulted in the discovery of a deeper stratum of preciousness in things and having revealed this substratum his eyes began to attack its treasures with all their savage wondering everything became newly subject to a mockery that was not of his own making and to an onslaught of confusion that threatened to violate his precious world of death and dolls but was there perhaps a more profound source of mockery and confusion that could be excavated beneath the deceptive wealth which he had so quickly exhausted if there was he did not possess the ambition at this point to seek it out dropping to the shattered mosaic of the floor collapsing under the now lovely doll hung trees he lay abject in ragged robes of despair throughout a full day and late into the night
6607729 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
6607730 thus gradually the pathetic lusterless world he had made and labored to make low had rebelliously elevated itself beyond its surface decrepitude and assumed a kind of grandeur in his eyes the naked limbs of what had once been trees and now were empty objects hollow abstractions mocked by the sarcastic verdure of the green lamps underwent transfiguration to inherit the suppleness of all symbols and the dignity of a dream each of the disfigured dolls vile and insane mimics of the human nightmare gave up their evil and revealed themselves as the protectors of countless inexpressible mysteries and myriad secret enchantments and the precocious corpses upon the altar no longer drifted about pointlessly embalmed in their wombs of foggy glass but hovered serenely in becalmed fathoms of infinite wonder
6607731 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
6607732 its certainly had a tremendous toll on everyone thats involved emotional physical well get through
6607733 motion presents non frivolous arguments suggesting he currently lacks a rational understanding of the connection between his role in his offense and the punishment imposed upon him
6607734 we applaud the court for upholding jeff woods rudimentary due process right to have his competency evaluated
6607735 our attorneys are reviewing the order and will make a decision whether to appeal
6607736 police say so and so died last night in a wreck
6607737 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6607738 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6607739 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6607740 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6607741 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6607742 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6607743 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6607744 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas
6607745 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6607746 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6607747 old customs and manners are disappearing along with the generation that still remembers how the old customs were performed
6607748 that extra inch under last years minimum is killing us
6607749 i respect him i dont like it but i respect him
6607750 i played so bad at the pga i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did i was looking forward to this week and today
6607751 its a lot of opinion for someone who hasnt been to the ryder cup
6607752 but hes done all the right things and if hes hot then hes getting picked if hes not then ill sidestep him
6607753 i dont know exactly what hes thinking with the picks
6607754 but i think hes going to pick the best players he can
6607755 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6607756 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6607757 i cant believe they call him holy father dont they know nobody is holy but god the father
6607758 a very great honour for a little girl from charlemagne

6607762 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6607763 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6607764 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6607765 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6607766 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6607767 im sick of drinking and smoking you know what i mean
6607768 i dont really smoke as much as i used to and im just looking after myself a bit better for me and my children i just want to live forever man i dont want to be not well
6607769 we dont really speak that much theres nothing to say
6607770 we speak if the music aint right we sort of pull each other aside and go look youre doing that wrong or youre doing that right and thats it really we see enough of each other on the stage
6607771 im cool with it theres things he dont like about me theres things i dont like about him i refuse to be like him and he refuses to be like me
6607772 the minute you tell someone someone tells that and then you end up paranoid and blaming people so i thought the best way to do it was to tell no one

6607775 people are sort of going on about this tribute to john lennon its not a tribute to john
6607776 if i tried to write a song about john lennon itd sound ridiculous so its just a song man you know people will have to get what they get from it you know what i mean i hate when people say its about this its about that because instantly people stop using their imagination and you just look for that
6607777 im the only whos doing that everyones throwing moves and throwing their arms about
6607778 im sick of all these everyone thats in a band these days as soon as they open their mouth their hands go up in the air they all think theyre jumping jack flash man

6607780 you try just to worry about yourself but as other coaches have told me when you have a clean athlete these other people are stealing from you

6607789 the ground was just a touch soft that day in the diana and having that race under her belt set her up well for today
6607790 they didnt know it until it came out in the paper one time
6607791 i had done it pretty much all summer sneaking out on saturday night with their car they thought i was just out running around one time i won the class i was in and they put it in the paper
6607792 we found out the show business pays more than racing for points
6607793 i think drag racing is one of the hardest motor sports there is because its so unforgiving
6607794 in nascar if you run 500 miles and make a mistake on the 50th lap you have time to make it up in drag racing you make a hundreth of a second mistake and youre beat

6607796 the game will feel and play differently each week with adidas live season if ronaldinho has a great match on the weekend youll feel the difference when you pick up the controller as his in game attributes increase
6607797 i had the chance to drive in the games first run and didnt do it and that changes the whole game right there
6607798 when i have that chance i have to come through
6607799 that says a lot obviously this is a lot different team with ken griffey jr and adam dunn gone but we still have to produce runs we cant use that as an excuse we had chances and we do have people capable of doing it
6607800 we had zambrano sort of on the ropes early because he wasnt sharp
6607801 but he got out of the first inning with no runs leaving a runner on third with less than two outs that was crucial and when you give zambrano 13 5 3 29 an early lead he knows what to do with it
6607802 nobody gets a lot of runs against the cubs staff
6607803 arent they no 1 in the league second other than the four runs we gave up in the eighth inning of the first game we held their offense down pretty good too
6607804 we played a good series and just came up a run short from winning the series
6607805 we played good defense but we just lacked some timely hitting
6607806 fogg wasnt throwing the ball badly but when you are facing a guy like zambrano you cant give him too much of a lead
6607807 when you have an opportunity to score runs you have to take it
6607808 we were at the bottom of order and we were pushing the envelope all day hit and runs stealing
6607809 all my guys unless i stop em if they think they have the base stolen they can take it that pitch happened to be a fastball up a pretty good pitch for catcher henry blanco to throw
6607810 we were looking for a grass race for him and the monmouth grass surface should be perfect for big brown
6607811 monmouth was cordial enough to put up a nice purse for him and the fans really took to big brown last time he was there
6607812 well use this race to go to the synthetic surface at santa anita and the breeders cup classic oct 25
6607813 honestly right then i was more nervous for him in the race than i ever had been at any time in my whole career
6607814 part of it was because i had no control over what was about to happen
6607815 i couldnt talk couldnt move i didnt want to sit here i wanted to go outside until it was over
6607816 i grew up around a lot of my chinese heritage
6607817 wed celebrate chinese new year and go to all the festivals sponsored by the chinese benevolent society i can remember watching chinese movies with the english subscripts and then there was the food all the things my mom made her sweet and sour chicken the beef and broccoli so many things
6607818 a lot of black people talk about going back to africa to the motherland but for me i always had a special place for china and i was dying to come here
6607819 i was very rusty and i guess i was going faster than i thought
6607820 then i just got into trouble about hurdle three or four
6607821 i tried to correct all of that tried to get quicker strides and get them shorter but it was too late i was in a zone that was going much faster than expected and it just got me closer and closer to every hurdle so finally i just tried to hold on and see what place i could get
6607822 i tried my best today and in the end i cant be unsatisfied with the year so far especially with a lot of the training i did on my own
6607823 its been a good olympics and the best thing was having my family here today you always want to be surrounded by your family
6607824 the pitching staff is solid enough to win plenty of ballgames
6607825 we really need a starting catcher unless they are going to go with ryan hanigan and i havent seen him enough we need a solid guy you can run out there five days a week a guy who can hit a little bit a regular guy instead of dividing it up between a couple of guys
6607826 were going to need two other guys who can hit probably outfielders
6607827 our infield is decently set if shortstop alex gonzalez comes back so we need a couple of outfielders to replace those home runs we lost adam dunn ken griffey jr
6607828 we just need a lineup from top to bottom that feels the same when we pitch against the other teams lineup so we dont have as many weak spots
6607829 i mean with the cubs im facing a seven hole hitter like mark derosa who hits 280 thats the feeling we need to project to other teams
6607830 we have enough right now in our starting staff and bullpen to win this division for sure
6607831 woke up with it tuesday morning after sleeping on one of those darned soft hotel pillows
6607832 it is just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do on an 0 and 2 pitch try to trick em instead of going right at them
6607833 also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength
6607834 theyre told a hitter is weak if you go hard inside but the pitchers strength isnt throwing hard inside do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
6607835 i guess thats why pete has twice as many hits as me
6607836 he knows how many the two of them live in
6607837 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6607838 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
6607839 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
6607840 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
6607841 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
6607842 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
6607843 im not making a read my lips statement in that i will not raise taxes

6607846 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
6607847 overall i think a year from now we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course
6607848 we will win this conflict we will win it easily
6607849 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
6607850 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should

6607855 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6607856 thats not professional ball theyre only 12 years old thats what they see on espn
6607857 theyre learning early how to pimp home runs i guess
6607858 thats what television has done to everybody i dont like celebrations its a matter of disrespect for the other club i wasnt brought up that way
6607859 some guys point to the sky and it looks like theyre hot dogging
6607860 now albert pujols he just points real quick he does it with class i have no problem with the way he does it
6607861 after x more ivf cycles we are done and after x adoption attempts or x years we are done
6607862 i know what you want and this version doesnt suit your needs
6607863 technically you can approximate it using importare on empty dirs cd some empty dir importare some package version or something equally disarmingly easy
6607864 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6607865 for all practical purposes military to military co operation had really already ended with the russians
6607866 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6607867 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6607868 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6607869 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6607870 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6607871 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6607872 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6607873 our policy is that jersey numbers will be retired only after a player enters the hall of fame as a diamondback
6607874 looking at that i would imagine that our first would be randy johnson
6607875 hopefully theres a lot more but i expect no 51 will be first
6607876 its so subjective if its not as concrete as making it to the hall of fame as a diamondback
6607877 there are a lot of players whose jersey wont be worn out of respect
6607878 we leave it up to the players they have a choice to wear 20 or 9 or others they typically will say id rather have another one and then well find another number for them they could request it but i would be surprised if they did most players would stay away from them
6607879 hopefully very soon well have our new museum which would be a perfect place to display either busts or images of players with their stats and contributions
6607880 but we will have more or less a d backs hall of fame for great players of the past we have lots of plans and it could be as soon as this upcoming offseason if not in the next two or three years for sure

6607897 once we tied the game i had a good feeling because we had good defense and good pitching

6607935 i saw her in one this past summer when she and jill hung out my parents pool she looked like a greek goddess
6607936 yes but i think with one more drink or two alex is going to jump you
6607937 cant blame him not with you two dressed like that
6607938 tina keeps rubbing up against alex im sure hes already sporting a lump in his pants she definitely has plans for him
6607939 i think i am just as long as she comes home with me
6607940 sounds like college is going to be one hell of a romp for you two
6607941 those two women are all but throwing themselves at alex and hes eating it up
6607942 but thats exactly what carrie and tina plan on doing both would like to try a black man and alex is the lucky guy
6607943 well we were sort of hoping that youd be willing to have some fun too
6607944 but it looks like alex and the ladies are going to do something in either case
6607945 they would hell it looks like theyre all ready to rip each others clothes off any second
6607946 tell them i said goodbye if they even notice im gone
6607947 if its what they want then so be it i wont stop them
6607948 its been fun but i already knew that we wouldnt be together for long hes not really my type
6607949 its too cold out there besides its not like you live around here
6607950 why not come back inside and well figure it out there
6607951 i think the alcohol is beginning to hit me i could probably use to lie down for a while
6607952 you can use carries room i promise to make sure no one bothers you
6607953 im still trying to figure out a way of getting you out of that wrap youre wearing
6607954 its an least an inch longer than joels and robbies
6607955 in my family we always had wine with dinner just a half glass when we were kids
6607956 ive been wondering how it would feel to kiss you since the first moment i laid eyes on you
6607957 youre just hoping that a kiss will lead to something more
6607958 it feels like its christmas and im getting to unwrap one last present the big one my father always saved for last
6607959 i hope santa brings me the same thing next christmas youre the best present i ever received
6607960 i thought alexs big dick would have taken care of that
6607961 only i dont give it to every guy alex has been trying for weeks but i wouldnt let him have it
6607962 thankfully being as youre carries man youre not one of mine so you wont have to work so hard in fact youre welcome to it
6607963 come on white boy fill my black ass with your cum
6607964 you arent my first white man but youre certainly the best
6607965 i figured you two would be here tina is riding alexs face while carrie is taking his pole in her ass i thought now would be a good time to find you guys

6607978 i have to ask my mom dad if its ok first
6607979 it was an absolutely tragic end to a thing where we were hoping against hope that we could possibly have a better outcome
6607980 hes a tough little guy but their confirmed professional opinion was that he had no hope he was suffering he did need to be put down
6607981 were not going anywhere but were in a big hurry
6607982 marmadukes owner man offers up a fatalistic zen like aphorism on the futility of 21st century life that doubles as an explanation of his huge stupid dogs behaviour
6607983 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6607984 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6607985 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6607986 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6607987 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6607988 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6607992 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6607993 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6607994 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6607995 if theres a team that can rebound from something like this its team penske
6607996 theyve done it before and were going to do it again its tough because you have some small bits seats for example i loved the seat that i had and im going to have to use the spare one little details
6607997 the car was prepared for here my guys are going to do what they can were going to go out there put that behind us and hopefully that will give us even more motivation to go out there and do well
6607998 it really comes down to the amount of work that has to be done
6607999 the difficult part is the amount of time and effort that goes into the customization of the race cars and the trailer and the pit equipment and that type of thing
6608000 from a financial perspective its never easy and never fun but you run a similar risk every weekend when you crash a race car
6608001 at the end of the day you can say theyre 400 000 you can say theyre 600 000 but who knows there are certain parts of the car that are going to be salvageable and certain parts that arent
6608002 what we brought here today are very small things very unique tools things you cant buy
6608003 im confident that with the quality of our people anytime we bring a backup car to the racetrack that backup car should be prepared as if its going to become a race car
6608004 otherwise we shouldnt really have it here at the level we participate at
6608005 roger goes right into the technical whys and wherefores of how does that happen what happened whats the extent of the damage

6608007 this is not something i think is essential to microsofts survival
6608008 effort to redefine the meaning and value of windows for our customers
6608009 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6608010 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6608011 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6608012 with every pre season game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6608013 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6608014 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6608015 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6608016 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6608017 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6608018 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6608019 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a pre season game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6608020 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6608021 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6608022 i thought it was going to be in the dugout i thought it was going to be in a camera well but it sounds like its just going to be away from the field
6608023 taking a quick look on a tv monitor that can be ruled on in a matter of a couple of seconds
6608024 they get the call right thats all im worried about
6608025 there are too many other things that major league baseball can do to shorten games instant replay is not going to make that big a deal
6608026 its one play a week maybe where its a borderline home run call its not something thats going to slow down that many games
6608027 there wont be any argument from either side you cant really argue with videotape
6608028 though my brother believed in destiny and took death as a normal thing i must tell you here that his death is really a blow to our family
6608029 the death of herbert nganjo endeley is a rude shock not only to the endeleys but the entire bakweri tribe and why not cameroon for all that i knew him and for all that he did was not only for the tribe
6608030 we will miss him because his services are no longer there there is nothing he would do for us again
6608031 we need to serve each other for the good of all
6608032 we are now establishing the centres of excellence at utech the university of technology and the university of the west indies
6608033 theres an institute of sport where usains coach glen mills is the head coach
6608034 the current government is only a year old but weve increased the budget for sport significantly its important for our young people
6608035 i cant imagine what will happen but im confident of getting the stick around
6608036 im telling people it was the stick the sticks fault k if people want to blame me they can blame me i dont care it was a bad day for us
6608037 we were going to go to the finals and win this is definitely very heartbreaking
6608038 with songs for beginners i realized i could craft something special that you could listen to and could help you in your own life
6608039 at the time i wrote those songs they were very hopeful there was bleakness but i tried to put an opening of light at the end
6608040 but i wanted it to be straight from my heart to whoever listened to it what im saying has survived pretty well
6608041 but i just got the word about my mom who is 82 years old succumbed to pancreatic cancer moms condition has been tough for about a year now but she broke her hip on the eve of the opening ceremony and if you know anything about cancer once that trauma was added to the weight of her circumstance it was a very difficult last 14 days
6608042 grapes cherry would always say ill be fine dont worry about me
6608043 im probably in that bubble of denial that you get into when youre involved in television but the truth of the matter is i gave her all i had all my life so theres no harm in not having been there for the final moments but ive got to get home needless to say to help out with some of the work at home
6608044 we were completely supportive of whatever ron decided to do
6608045 the audience has a personal connection with him and had he not just shown up on the air people would have asked questions
6608046 ron is a big part of a lot of peoples lives on saturday night with hockey night and the olympics and other major events and people feel a connection
6608047 hes been dealing with his moms situation for a while but hes pretty private about it and doesnt talk to anybody about it and hasnt really made it a focus
6608048 i think in his mind he wants to give so much to the show that whatever it is he wont let that get in the way
6608049 but hes also a soulful type of loving man so im sure hes dealing with it in his own way i thought his announcement was handled gracefully
6608050 to be dealt with later and hopefully filed and forgotten
6608051 hes been a mentor to me especially since ive gotten into coaching
6608052 my goal is to get to know the guys as well as i can as fast as i can
6608053 if were going to win as a team they have to trust me
6608054 the uva study shows that listeners without formal musical training but with sufficient exposure to a certain musical idiom

6608059 while were pointing out the obvious how about an obvious yet unasked question why werent explosives the first thing considered as the cause for the wtc buildings collapse
6608060 yeah i believe what theyre telling me that can happen naturally

6608062 when youre a rookie you always have a lot to learn
6608063 i think im coming along pretty well and ive still got a lot to learn and a lot of experiences to go through so time will tell
6608064 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6608065 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6608066 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6608067 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6608068 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6608069 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6608070 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6608071 it looks like there is the possibility of a tumor in the kidney
6608072 and by the time you get to 1 youll be out
6608073 its so hot you could fry an egg on the sidewalk
6608074 i will be ready but i dont know about playing in the preseason
6608075 we will have to wait and see its always making progress every day i come out here its getting better
6608076 i know it aint exactly running but running in the pool is great conditioning
6608077 there is a timetable but id have to say its fluid because you just dont know for sure
6608078 thats the thing coaches ask all the time tell us when hes going to be back we want that answer too but its impossible
6608079 there are certain things you need to be on the field to see
6608080 right now theyre throwing the whole playbook at us and they want you to remember it all
6608081 hes a physical man and we just want him to have a speedy recovery so we can get him out here on the field
6608082 were going to need that guy because hes definitely a workhorse the guy is a great back
6608083 i think its a little more slow progress than we all thought it was going to be
6608084 maybe ed has a sense of that at one time because hes the guy that feels it were still optimistic that hell be there the first week but i dont think you can say definitely right now
6608085 we continue to have doctors look at him because we want to be absolutely sure
6608086 its not just about his ability to play in a game right now nobody thinks hes at risk in any way but we want to make darn sure thats the case
6608087 and there was reason for his concern while the cubs won the game and their
6608088 and while walks may be infuriating at least they do not give the opposition an immediate run while the comment is a little concerning it might be just as confusing

6608111 an amazing fact about the human condition is that every human has at least one natural talent that can be developed to excellence
6608112 if there is only one thing you should know let it be yourself until you know yourself all other knowledge serves no useful purpose sophias wisdoms fire answers these questions by resurrecting the greats whose minds decorated our world and whose words now demystify the pursuit of worldly success
6608113 the paths to greatness are daunting and therein even merit desires mercy what better mercy than the wisdom of those who have been there and have conquered
6608114 without exception every human has the ability to attain greatness there is no human so lacking in talent that they are precluded from attaining excellence in something
6608115 regardless of your perception of the universe and your fundamental beliefs you owe yourself the duty to succeed all humans are unique and complex entities with unique dreams and aspirations success starts when dreams meet light and aspirations meet action the time is ripe to give light to your dreams sophias fire
6608116 understand yourself well enough to know how to strengthen your weaknesses rather than just concealing them
6608117 to procrastinate is to alienate time and to be impatient is to fight time you cannot win in either use patience to form an ally with time

6608121 the one thing that seems to emerge clearly from the welter of evidence and historical or allegedly historical facts is that there is no established traditional method whereby the head chief of victoria is selected
6608122 at several meetings which i have held the headmen have expressed a wish to have a head chief with a council appointed but unfortunately there is no one with hereditary rights or with any rights whom we could appoint the man manga williams whom i mentioned in my first letter is not chief of victoria town and has no rights but as there is no one with any rights i selected him as being educated and owning property since my first memorandum to his excellency on the subject opposition to the appointment of williams has arisen in a village called bonjongo but if his honour will approve of the appointment of a head chief with a council say on six months probation i will either persuade the bonjongo people to consent to williams appointment on probation or find another man the one outstanding fact is that it is absolutely necessary there should be a head chief for the district

6608128 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6608129 staff were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information
6608130 the best i can tell you is that the letters contained a threat to those who have read it we have turned everything over to law enforcement
6608131 theres still a significant amount of cars that are being sold
6608132 theres definitely been a dramatic shift in the last six to 12 months and the car industry needs longer than that to plan for the future
6608133 we are making the right decisions and bringing the focus in 2011 is the right decision
6608134 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined
6608135 the scene was set for bhp and rio yesterday afternoon and the market anticipated their stocks would benefit

6608141 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6608142 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6608143 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6608144 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6608145 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6608146 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6608147 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6608148 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6608149 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6608150 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6608151 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6608152 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6608153 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6608154 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz
6608155 the man started throwing wild punches at the woman who did not give up but kept punching back
6608156 men who harass women in public places should be expecting that kind of beating from women
6608157 the man who was floored had a very bad habit of pinching womens buttocks in public

6608159 but they say only the bodys good fat which we are born with can be transformed and not the bad fat created by over eating and not exercising enough
6608160 you do not loose muscle unless you have a serious health issue or have been starved for more than a few days
6608161 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6608162 the purpose of the placebo pills is that the user can take a pill on every day of her menstrual cycle remaining in this daily habit even during the week without hormones placebo pills may contain an iron supplement as iron requirements increase during menstruation failure to take pills during the placebo week has no effect on the effectiveness of the pill provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week
6608163 i always thought it was because if you skip a couple pills in the middle it may cause you to ovulate which is when you get pregnant
6608164 mother baby and family are all happy and healthy he said in a statement associated press reported

6608181 the large car market is actually declining while it ford is doing well in its segment the number of people interested in that segment overall has declined
6608182 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6608183 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6608184 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6608185 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6608186 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6608187 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6608188 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6608189 there are no posts to show this could because there are no posts in this forum or due to a filter
6608190 sign that both parties intend to fight for the votes of religious christians

6608209 e un pagliaccio ha scomodato un sacco di gente lo dobbiamo ammazzare
6608210 non permetteremo mai alla magistratura di esercitare una supplenza rispetto al potere legislativo cosa che alcuni magistrati tendono a fare su questo come su altri temi

6608338 this means that as soon as non critical water is identified it can be seized the water holders compensated and the water used to revive the murray the darling and the lower lakes
6608339 that is in the long term interests of all the farmers and the communities that depend on our rivers not just south australians
6608340 it will show us how much water is in the system but we still wont be able to get at it
6608341 i did not have people coming to me saying you must support this industry
6608342 on the contrary i was overwhelmed with people suggesting that this is not compatible with the aspirations of this community
6608343 i came to the conclusion that it was time to make a stand and ask the government to also make a declaration that they would protect the community
6608344 we not only maintained our position as the biggest bank in the world but also became the most profitable bank in the world jiang jianqing chairman of the bank told reporters
6608345 almost all business loans in icbc have been growing very quickly mr jiang said
6608346 we have been growing our credit but at the same time we have also been growing our net fee and commission based income businesses
6608347 icbc began to sell down those bonds since early this year mr jiang said
6608348 from early this year until now we have sold us8 billion worth of fannie and freddie bonds as well as alt a bonds
6608349 the profit growth will slow down with narrower interest margin while the credit costs will go up as there is a big chance of economic slowdown in mainland china in the second half and a credit problem is likely to emerge he said
6608350 we still have the second half to go so we will continue to work hard mr jiang told reporters in response to a question on icbc overtaking hsbc as the most profitable bank a corker too dear to drink

6608352 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6608353 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6608354 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago he said
6608355 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later he said
6608356 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6608357 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6608358 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6608359 the national parks and wildlife service made the decision last night following veterinary advice from taronga zoo and sea world and in consultation with animal welfare groups orcca and rspca that the animal should be euthanased immediately
6608360 the animal deteriorated quickly yesterday afternoon and was found to be suffering from previous shark inflicted injuries experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes part of a whales triangular tail were hanging down
6608361 npws and animal welfare groups agreed that the whales suffering should not be prolonged
6608362 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
6608363 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6608364 that was the best way it could have been done
6608365 the firefighters are absolutely furious about the treatment by the government
6608366 they have approved 500 000 that will be used as seed capital for a grassroots campaign

6608381 he was one of the first three guys involved in the solano county drug abuse program in the 60s and they had the most drug arrests at the time for five years running
6608382 back when he was an officer they all walked the beat there were only two patrol cars in the city and everyone knew him
6608383 he wanted to make sure everyone was taken care of on the street and he taught me to never be mean to people because they need your help
6608384 he loved the police department and i told him i wanted to be a police officer and go into criminal justice
6608385 he said to me if he had to do it all over again he would have been a fireman and because of him i have been one for more than 27 years
6608386 he taught us to always do what you say youre going to do
6608387 he would come to my games and watch and never say anything during the game
6608388 but i knew the next day he had a lot to say
6608389 big family meals were always important to him he was the ultimate family man making sure the family stayed together

6608419 the boomerang should be returned to kurnell as a symbol of that first meeting and so all australians have the opportunity to see it
6608420 having the boomerang back in kurnell will be an historic symbol of harmony between our two cultures and will help teach young australians about the importance of aboriginal culture
6608421 i think thats probably realistic we have to win all our games if we want to make the eight
6608422 you cant get too far ahead of yourselves and if we dont win this saturday our seasons over its all finished
6608423 theres still a long way to go and at the moment were coming 12th so weve got a lot of work to do
6608424 theres obviously a lot of expectation on us as a club
6608425 parramatta they have a lot of supporters and seem to get a lot of criticism in the media at the moment
6608426 no matter if were winning or losing people sort of want to criticise us but thats all well and good
6608427 our fans expect a lot of us and they tend to be pretty harsh on us at times
6608428 but we expect a lot of ourselves as well and were disappointed with our season but at the moment were still in there with a chance
6608429 theres a bit of excitement building now and weve got a little momentum over the last couple of weeks but weve got to keep that going
6608430 coalition leaders are expected to meet friday the talks will focus on the the judges issue
6608431 they rehman and wali are mediating and we hope they will come up with a solution
6608432 the president and prime minister reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6608433 again unfortunately this is a koala that has been bashed to death and then after its dead they removed its leg
6608434 the profiles of serious violent criminals overwhelmingly list cruelty to animals before progression to people
6608435 the rspca is absolutely right in calling for tougher penalties to be enforced and to point out the longest sentence for cruelty handed down by queensland courts is just four months jail
6608436 we believe our decision to fly him to cairns was justified
6608437 we took advice from our png security firm as there were concerns about his safety and psychological circumstances
6608438 i was afraid and i ran i was confused it happened so quickly
6608439 i was scared and turned to run but the car came and i was cornered by another car and got hit
6608440 he hit the cars my girl and ran off police didnt get a chance to arrest him
6608441 hes a big official but hes not above the law
6608442 the australians must bring him back we will not fight him or hurt him we just want him to face court and pay compensation
6608443 we expect the total industry to soften for the second half of this year she said
6608444 it started in july and we anticipate that well see more of these actions across the industry for the rest of this year
6608445 what weve said previously is that to cater for that well have to hire approximately 300 staff but unfortunately the action we have to take now is to manage the business in the interim
6608446 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6 00 am local time 0200 gmt all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6608447 over the course of august 22 the retreat of all these forces in georgia will be completed
6608448 only the russian peacekeeping soldiers in numbers required to ensure security will remain within the limits of the security zone at specially installed posts
6608449 the defence ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6608450 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6608451 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6608452 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6608453 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6608454 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6608455 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6608456 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6608457 i do have an announcement meet the browns the television show starts in january on tbs
6608458 same kind of situation as we did for house of payne and youre the first to know you talked me into it
6608459 the one campaign isnt about taking sides its about taking action
6608460 america is saving millions of lives in the poorest parts of the world i saw it myself in zambia and tanzania
6608461 i think passengers would be better served if airlines raised their fares to cover their costs and offer good service instead of the mickey mouse approaches they have taken
6608462 i think passengers would respond to good service and be willing to pay for quality
6608463 whenever theres a significant delay or flight problem remember that the crew is frustrated angry and maybe even scared about what could happen
6608464 crew members tend to react defensively when they feel attacked
6608465 the more reasonable that you are in remembering that it isnt their fault the more that theyll remember its not your fault either and try to help you
6608466 when you smile you cant help but sound more friendly
6608467 only ask for something when you need it be polite and even if the response angers you respond positively and with understanding
6608468 and if you are treated badly avoid a confrontation unless it is a matter of safety but take notes of what happened and the name of the person responsible to file a complaint with the airline that wont make up for the incident but it will probably get you some sort of compensation
6608469 as the industry continues to cut back in order to reduce costs you should expect more of the same
6608470 full planes overbooking poor service these all should be expected
6608471 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6608472 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6608473 and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its not 2004 and its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
6608474 we thought about that 2007 world cup game all the time im not going to lie
6608475 weve seen brazil three times since that last match but it wasnt the same
6608476 on the world stage is when teams really come to play so it sat with us a little bit but we were confident in our team defending so i knew it was going to be a different game altogether
6608477 i cant even recall the saves or how it happened but all i know is that i was playing with a different energy tonight and it just felt so good
6608478 there were several different defining moments in this game i think
6608479 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6608480 why is it that every little kid that comes into contact with him is broken
6608481 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6608482 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6608483 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6608484 no se trata que voten porque son de tal o cual nacionalidad sino porque son unas estrellas
6608485 there are about nineteen kinds of audience silence ranging from really good to really bad
6608486 self promotion is not a sin unlike touching yourself inappropriately on the bus or wearing tevas with a skirt
6608487 i am starting to feel my age let us leave it at that
6608488 i want to hug my poems i want to kiss my poems to thank them for sheltering and feeding me
6608489 i spent hours this morning switching verbs then nouns then starting over again
6608490 our biggest issue yet is so frisky and slippery and full of pseudoinformation and prone to inappropriate touching it will make you squeal
6608491 solzhenitsyn but i thought he was from the eighteenth century
6608492 religion proper arose along with the settlement in sedentary townships made possible by agriculture
6608493 mark out those who one can expect aid from because they have demonstrated the costly signaling religion requires from those who are more likely to cheat
6608494 the self evident truths of the declaration of independence were an atheistic teaching of thomas jefferson that contradicts the bible
6608495 whether the designer of life was a dope a demon or a deity
6608496 from the bare conclusion of design i see no necessary major implications for our daily lives
6608497 its just unlike any other closing ceremony ive ever seen
6608498 siempre que hay un asesinato la gente saca conclusiones y siempre es dios o satan s el que le dice al asesino que lo haga estas percepciones no deben ser tomadas en serio porque es de todos conocido que cualquiera por su propia voluntad puede matar a otra persona
6608499 we had sent a letter to the tata motors managing director ravi kant to find out what exactly they had written to mamata banerjee on the land requirement in singur and its use
6608500 he has replied that the small car plant would need 1 000 acres and that the vendors or ancillary units are very much part of the project
6608501 the tatas have made it clear that the project area is 1 000 acres therefore no confusion remains
6608502 she should understand that it would be next to impossible to give back the 400 acres if trinamul comes up with any other proposal we can discuss it he said
6608503 well sit on the road if the government refuses to allow the camps if prohibitory orders are clamped that would be highly undemocratic and would amount to applying force
6608504 wow i would have wanted to be a first class passenger
6608505 we came to visit for a day and stayed three
6608506 its a terrific little town with a keen focus on tourism it may seem like an odd place for this but really its the perfect place

6608511 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6608512 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6608513 my client is willing to sit alone with mukesh at whatever time and place he suggests
6608514 we are willing to let the brothers sit with any expert or their mother to resolve the issue
6608515 i appear for ril and mukesh ambani is not a party to the court proceedings i will have to take instructions
6608516 why dont you go back to your mother both parties should settle its not a family dispute its a matter of national importance and a resolution will be in the public interest since natural gas is a national asset

6608551 it certainly is legitimate to cite aurobindos own statements about this and other inner experiences but personal reminiscences dont count for much in scholarly biographies unless they are backed up by objective data and analysis but what sort of objective data was i to look for nobody knew what was going on in aurobindos head if i wanted to discuss this inner event did i have to switch in mid stream from the conventions of scholarly biography to the conventions of spiritual biography that is hagiography or could i get beyond the conventions of both genres
6608552 for to the modern mind avatarhood is one of the most difficult to accept or to understand of all the ideas that are streaming in from the east upon the rationalised human consciousness it is apt to take it at the best for a mere figure for some high manifestation of human power character genius great work done for the world or in the world and at the worst to regard it as a superstition to the heathen a foolishness and to the greeks a stumbling block the materialist necessarily cannot even look at it since he does not believe in god to the rationalist or the deist it is a folly and a thing of derision to the thoroughgoing dualist who sees an unbridgeable gulf between the human and the divine nature it sounds like a blasphemy the rationalist objects that if god exists he is extracosmic or supracosmic and does not intervene in the affairs of the world but allows them to be governed by a fixed machinery of law he is in fact a sort of far off constitutional monarch or spiritual king log at the best an indifferent inactive spirit behind the activity of nature like some generalised or abstract witness purusha of the sankhyas he is pure spirit and cannot put on a body infinite and cannot be finite as the human being is finite the ever unborn creator and cannot be the creature born into the world these things are impossible even to his absolute omnipotence to these objections the thoroughgoing dualist would add that god is in his person his role and his nature different and separate from man the perfect cannot put on human imperfection the unborn personal god cannot be born as a human personality the ruler of the worlds cannot be limited in a nature bound human action and in a perishable human body these objections so formidable at first sight to the reason seem to have been present to the mind of the teacher in the gita when he says that although the divine is unborn imperishable in his self existence the lord of all beings yet he assumes birth by a supreme resort to the action of his nature and by force of his self maya that he whom the deluded despise because lodged in a human body is verily in his supreme being the lord of all that he is in the action of the divine consciousness the creator of the fourfold law and the doer of the works of the world and at the same time in the silence of the divine consciousness the impartial witness of the works of his own nature for he is always beyond both the silence and the action the supreme purushottama and the gita is able to meet all these oppositions and to reconcile all these contraries because it starts from the vedantic view of existence of god and the universe
6608553 so if the modern mind entering into the spirit of the avatarhood also

6608630 esa es la gran decisi n que tiene que tomar la presidenta
6608631 lo que pasa es que la gente cree que con el voto de cobos el campo gan y se terminaron los problemas y en realidad estamos un poco menos mal pero no significa que hayamos avanzado en cuanto a pol ticas en serio
6608632 la econom a agraria no es solamente tierra capital y trabajo
6608633 tambi n expectativas y si no la hay el productor vende las vacas y alquila el campo pero si la hay pone mas vacas as de simple
6608634 no para nada no hay interna con de angeli porque no hay posibilidades de eso hay criterios distintos en torno a algunas cosas yo le dije claramente primero a l y despu s a los medios que no me gust para nada que se saque fotos con macri o que por lo menos aclare que es l el que se saca la foto y no federaci n agraria argentina porque esa foto no tiene nada que ver conmigo
6608635 its alright dont worry you guys got it you just need to get out there and perform wens is already sprouting but thats ok you just need to keep on doing your thing get in the zone focus and sprout thats all you gotta do just do your thing follow your nature and sprout
6608636 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6608637 everything is not an anecdote you have to discriminate you choose things that are funny or mildly amusing or interesting when youre telling these little stories heres a good idea have a point it makes things so much more interesting for the listener
6608638 time is everything so having these helipads closer to us is better for patient outcome
6608639 we may still need to land in park if needed
6608640 but its much safer to be landing on the roof because we wouldnt have to move people in the park out or have to transport the patient across the street
6608641 i have no question that ms mcclenahan has led an exemplary life and is a good neighbor and mother
6608642 people make bad decisions in a split second or an angry moment
6608643 unjustifiably injuring an animal or being negligent causing that animal to be injured
6608644 shes not surprised about anything coming out of our criminal justice system at this point
6608645 the guilty verdict was enough for me but i feel it was very fair
6608646 theres no doubt in my mind that ms mcclenahan did not intentionally hit parker or try to hurt him in any way
6608647 she is sorry parker got hit and for any injuries she would not want to see an animal hurt she is a lover of animals as well as an environmentalist if ms bonnet knew ms mcclenahan she would know she is not capable of animal cruelty
6608648 amo a este deporte y por nada del mundo me dopar a

6608663 well you got to protect them you take them off today you try to sell them tomorrow because if they find them in here theyll come and get them
6608664 there really isnt anything you can do to protect your vehicle most alarm systems are only geared toward your door and ignition system

6608667 sab a que mi r cord ten a las horas contadas pero no esperaba que bolt me lo quitase tan pronto el otro d a en semifinales corri en 20 09 haciendo al trote los ltimos 40 metros
6608668 si el otro d a dije tras la carrera de 100 metros que nunca hab a visto una exhibici n igual rectific la de hoy la supera ha sido maravilloso verlo correr tiene una combinaci n letal de velocidad y zancada
6608669 cuando quiera me quitar tambi n el r cord de 400 ser el d a que l quiera
6608670 yo creo que no ha hecho un entrenamiento espec fico de 100 metros aunque la gente pueda pensar lo contrario y ha sido capaz de correr en 9 69 lo ha hecho el a o que se ha puesto en ello
6608671 la clave estar en que no cometa ning n error durante el desarrollo de la carrera
6608672 clyde su entrenador me insist a en que deb a distribuir bien las energ as que un parcial muy r pido o muy lento al principio podr a arruinar la marca y todo el trabajo
6608673 el d a que hice r cord en 400 metros yo pas por el 200 en 21 22 di 182 zancadas y stas fueron muy cortas me dijeron que 2 20 metros cada una estos datos me demuestran que bolt est en condiciones de mejorarlo cuando se ponga a ello
6608674 si se lo propone puede pasar por debajo de 21 el 200 y correr en 42 segundos
6608675 cuando quiera bolt me quitar el r cord de 400

6608677 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
6608678 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
6608679 the record highlights the extent of the opportunity that we as a team have in front of us to achieve something significant and thats exciting
6608680 the brain was damaged bruised and it takes a long time for the brain to heal
6608681 so as it does heal he will definitely get out of this state of confusion
6608682 compared to what he was even two weeks ago his confusion is so much better and his memory is so much better
6608683 obviously just number one was for him to survive and then after that i got selfish and wanted him to be 100 per cent
6608684 he couldnt even tell me that hed live hes a very lucky boy
6608685 considering that he got hit by a tram hes doing very well i think
6608686 it is just such a long process but considering where he was at the start and where he is now he is doing amazing
6608687 he is in such good spirits i am really proud of him
6608688 if at any point during this hed said i dont want to do an interview we would have gone away
6608689 hemos estado todo el a o trabajando por esto lo nico que pens bamos es que quer amos hacerlo mejor que ayer y no hacerlo peor eso nos ha puesto un poco nerviosas al salir pero una vez te tiras al agua dejas de pensar
6608690 nunca hab amos tenidos un 9 9 tan un nime tanto en la art stica como en la t cnica y un 9 9 es plata
6608691 he intentado aprender lo m ximo posible a su lado y ha sido un a o incre ble he intentado trabajar y observarla mucho preguntarle muchas cosas ver qu le sale por su talento natural y acercarme lo m ximo posible para formar una pareja competitiva
6608692 while many textbooks and articles have created the myth that the internet protocols were designed for warfare environments the top level goal for the darpa internet program was the sharing of large service machines on the arpanet
6608693 as a result many protocol specifications focus only on the operational aspects of the protocols they specify and overlook their security implications
6608694 in many cases vendors have implemented quick fixes to protocol flaws without a careful analysis of their effectiveness and their impact on interoperability
6608695 as a result any system built in the future according to the official tcp ip specifications might reincarnate security flaws that have already hit our communication systems in the past
6608696 in urlscan 3 0 we added the ability to do filtering based on the query string in addition to the url
6608697 we also added the ability to create more granular rules that can be targeted to specific types of requests for example you can write a rule that only applies to asp pages or php pages which is something you would never be able to do in urlscan 2 5
6608698 really the application running on the server is the only piece of code that actually knows what the sql query is intended to do
6608699 so the fix for the root cause is for application developers to go in and do the validation and make sure that the sql data that they are sending to the sql server is what they intend
6608700 spammers are using google sites and other google applications like a shield
6608701 in the past they used their own domains but the urls would end up on a block list whereas hosting on google sites the spammers can get through the blocks
6608702 spammers can get free statistics to see how effective their campaigns are
6608703 we expect spammers to use every means possible to try to send spam
6608704 thats why we have a very robust spam fighting effort at google we disable these accounts immediately and will continue to do so
6608705 i dont care about what other people say its none of their business

6608712 when i went in there as a rookie he was one of the guys who kind of adopted me he was a great guy a great family man and a mentor its a great loss to the raider family
6608713 he didnt look sick or anything he smiled and waved when we passed each other my wife and daughter had run into him in safeway just before that he called and told me my daughter was getting big
6608714 he started with a cabin here in the late 70s then moved up to a large home in the early 90s and then in about 1995 he bought a big home on the golf course
6608715 they spent every august here and theyd be over here for the christmas holiday
6608716 he was always very gracious with us when it came to media relations efforts
6608717 he was always willing to do interviews and be a spokesman for the event he was just a real sharp guy and a gentleman
6608718 i didnt see him a lot because this was more of a vacation home
6608719 playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege
6608720 he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6608721 my heart and prayers go out to his family as it also does to all nfl retirees and their families who are needlessly suffering tonight
6608722 velar con todos sus medios y garantizar todas las actuaciones para que se conozcan las causas y las circunstancias de la tragedia
6608723 dont some of these verbally priggish bloggers have something better to do
6608724 kingston gwen and gavin rossdale welcomed the newest member of their family
6608725 there are a couple of things he can do and a couple of things he cant do
6608726 i do not want to insinuate with him that hes not a tough guy or has to play injured he has to have some of his faculties hes got to be able to protect himself
6608727 thats usually the biggest factor that we look at are we putting a guy in peril does he have to play the game a different way can he protect himself we just need to make sure that he can
6608728 hemos convenido que merece la pena incluir en ese acuerdo algunos objetivos algunos plazos de c mo puede desarrollarse la retirada

6608757 so we have asked the federation and the national olympic committee to look into it again
6608758 larkin grimm describes her music as acoustic black metal interesting since she mostly makes jingly jangly folk music but i guess what shes trying to say is that its darker than your average strum and that it is here on her second album the last tree she takes the promise of her debut and gives her unique compositions more focus and more scope for experimentation allowing herself the space to create a quite incredible body of work she is a folk musician who has the uncanny ability to conjure up travels in a mystical lantern in hand as spirits sail chillingly by i dont suppose its an accident shes called grimm now is it her songs inhabit that precious fairytale world of sugared houses wolves and lost children they reside in a lost cave somewhere where the fireflies dance and magical water trickles down the cold stone
6608759 going up against this defense has made us better were building were growing theyre starting to play fast because theyre starting to know what to do to me this is a great opportunity
6608760 is that we had a year in san diego our second year there where we had a lot of young players and led the league in rushing we were at a much lower point than this so weve got to find out what this unit has a chance to be great at in san diego we just kept growing personnel wise well continue to do that here but the starting point here its not as dirty of a job as you think
6608761 you kind of take it one day at a time and let things play out the season hasnt started yet and all of the guys that are out were going to get back thats the good news
6608762 theyre not going to just take a hose to the torch here maybe 5 000 people with squirt guns
6608763 i came to these games with stratospheric expectations and theyve been exceeded
6608764 its pathetic a record in futility a lot of our field athletes just suffer from the i made the team syndrome rather than being able to peak again for the games
6608765 im not an expert on anything here and i live and breathe sports i wish i had a broader view of the world but i dont

6608769 other than still having working vocal chords its how excited i get to do this
6608770 hes got to learn a lot you just cant go out there and fling it and be reckless
6608771 you might see some ugly picks early on hell have to commit himself a lot more this year than he ever has
6608772 hes going to do very well with the jets hes going to have a huge impact on that team
6608773 the only reason brett should have stayed retired would have been if he lacked a desire to play but the end is rarely gracious for any player regardless of position or years of service
6608774 that first month of the season will be really difficult for him personally
6608775 to make a big change like that and come in and energize the team and lead the team to success if anyone can do it hes the man
6608776 i cant think of a quarterback of his stature that has ever had to make this type of transition
6608777 with a team thats trying to get to the next level you need someone to come in and make them believe they can get there brett can do those kinds of things
6608778 what a brilliant business move for the jets whatever he does this year will be an upgrade for the jets at that position
6608779 they just de limbed him it is what it is we are just trying to concentrate on the bills buffalo is a good football team
6608780 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6608781 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6608782 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6608783 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now

6608787 with record student enrollment expected on our campus this fall we may even exceed that expected number
6608788 we are seeing an increase in faculty staff discounted season and full price season tickets in fact our full price season tickets sold total is more than 1 000 tickets higher than last year
6608789 the defense played better they stepped up and turned it up a notch
6608790 the usa foundations motto was promoting a free market of ideas on the nations campuses and here we encounter yet another of the washington rights signature lines like so many conservative ideas anticommunism for example it sounds fine at first a free market of ideas sounds like free inquiry or a free exchange of ideas an environment in which hypotheses are tested and bad ones are wedded out while good ones go on to earn the respect of the community of scholars but this is not what the phrase means at all markets do not determine the objective merit of things only their price which is to say their merit in the eyes of large corporations and the very wealthy
6608791 i would have never expected a concept car to be that well executed and performing so nicely at such an early development phase
6608792 its going to be a lot of work for the guys and theyll be exremely tired
6608793 im not going to be whining if the car is pushing or loose im just going to go for it
6608794 were right there and not losing faith we still have a chance he needs to be more careful than us because he has more to lose and im always very comfortable on this type of circuit

6608796 cuba is one of the last places not surfed in the world its probably like bali was in the late 1960s

6608811 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6608812 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6608813 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6608814 stan is a proven leader with a strong knowledge of our industry and the trends shaping its future

6608822 the scientific community looks at it safety wise as that theres nothing wrong with it at all
6608823 its going to be a business decision as to whether producers use it or not
6608824 it is a safe process you are not going to glow in the dark
6608825 to get people to focus on what a pasteurization process does rather than how it does it

6608839 mccains support is rock solid in so many ways that in those places where obama identifies even the smallest hairline crack he needs to pry it open if he hopes to draw voters away from mccain especially in a state like virginia where the race may ultimately be decided by a handful of votes

6608865 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6608866 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6608867 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6608868 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6608869 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6608870 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6608871 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat

6608873 were looking at the whole of b c being potentially at risk the distribution of these maple leaf foods is very wide and the cases were investigating are throughout the province

6609321 hace tres o cuatro a os era un mec nico quien inspeccionaba el avi n entre vuelo y vuelo para comprobar que no hab a problemas ahora con los recortes de plantilla es el copiloto o el piloto quien da un vistazo por fuera al aparato por si ha habido p rdidas de combustible impactos de aves u otros percances
6609322 durante cada trayecto el piloto est obligado a anotar en el libro de partes de vuelo todas las aver as o incidencias pero muchas veces no se hace
6609323 muchos pilotos reciben una presi n muy fuerte por parte de las compa as para que no apunten da os supuestamente menores que podr an acarrear una revisi n m s afinada y con ella una demora del siguiente vuelo con el mismo aparato
6609324 si la aver a es leve lo que hacen muchos pilotos es anotarla en el trayecto de regreso entonces ya no hay tanta prisa porque el avi n se queda en aquel aeropuerto
6609325 en otros casos como cuando el aparato sufre un recalentamiento algunos comandantes optan por parar el motor un rato para enfriarlo y si al volver a encenderlo se ha apagado el testigo de avisos consideran que ya est solucionado y deciden despegar sin haber efectuado un buen control

6609386 por una parte est n los que llamamos teloneros pues antes de robar un cami n rajan la lona para ver qu hay dentro son delincuentes nacionales que roban las cargas de camiones que llevan principalmente tabaco ropa electrodom sticos o comida y que luego suelen revender en mercadillos locales
6609387 cada mes se roban en catalunya entre tres y cuatro camiones
6609388 es el t pico producto que buscan estos ladrones porque en un d a lo colocan
6609389 estos grupos no saben qu hacer cuando roban un cargamento por ejemplo de material de oficina las leyes las marca el mercado en navidad por ejemplo buscan camiones que transporten jamones

6609401 the time is not right for increases in the price of milk and dairy products for domestic consumers
6609402 in the current economic environment it is not responsible to take decisions that could increase the price of milk for domestic consumers next year

6609408 the viva la vida sessions were incredibly fruitful they gelled brilliantly with producer brian eno and recorded much more music than they could fit on one album
6609409 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs
6609410 it will be on a record we will put out in 2009 some time next year the album will neatly wrap up things for the end of the decade then i dont know what well do
6609411 religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the ruler as useful
6609412 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
6609413 i will be ready but i dont know about playing in the preseason
6609414 we will have to wait and see its always making progress every day i come out here its getting better
6609415 i know it aint exactly running but running in the pool is great conditioning
6609416 there is a timetable but id have to say its fluid because you just dont know for sure
6609417 thats the thing coaches ask all the time tell us when hes going to be back we want that answer too but its impossible
6609418 there are certain things you need to be on the field to see
6609419 right now theyre throwing the whole playbook at us and they want you to remember it all what they did the first day they might not bring it back up again until today and im like man i dont remember all this
6609420 hes a physical man and we just want him to have a speedy recovery so we can get him out here on the field
6609421 were going to need that guy because hes definitely a workhorse the guy is a great back
6609422 i think its a little more slow progress than we all thought it was going to be
6609423 maybe ed has a sense of that at one time because hes the guy that feels it were still optimistic that hell be there the first week but i dont think you can say definitely right now
6609424 we continue to have doctors look at him because we want to be absolutely sure
6609425 its not just about his ability to play in a game right now nobody thinks hes at risk in any way but we want to make darn sure thats the case
6609426 the childrens home is a very small house and is hindu it receives a lot less financial help than other childrens homes in petaling jaya everyone at the home was grateful for our help
6609427 the elephant sanctuary was peaceful you wont get a chance to ride an elephant anywhere else
6609428 it was really interesting viewing different architecture trying out the local cuisine and talking to the people of malaysia
6609429 we are integrating land maritime air special forces operations and selected interagency organizations in a realistic and challenging training environment
6609430 panamax used to be a strictly naval operation but it truly has become a joint combined exercise because that is the way we operate
6609431 we didnt have that interagency piece ready with the department of state and department of justice and others and we all learned from that
6609432 the bottom line is that dod cant do it all it takes all instruments of national power
6609433 we recognize that we can kill anything and we can destroy armies but as experience has shown that doesnt mean that you have won
6609434 this would all be so much easier if this was just a u s only military exercise
6609435 but thats not how we want to operate we dont want it to be just the u s alone
6609436 so its our imperative to ensure that we are all able to work together
6609437 this is a combined joint operation exactly like you would see in afghanistan and iraq
6609438 once you figure out what those capabilities are youre able to tap into those assets
6609439 this gives me a better appreciation of other services and other nations capabilities as well as their limitations
6609440 these are valuable lessons we need to learn here in a training environment
6609441 in the army we say that we need to train as we fight and thats what we are doing here
6609442 because of the complexity of the multinational environment it is absolutely critical that we practice as we would operate in a real world contingency this is the place where we identify any hiccups and work out those practices
6609443 is that if you dont practice you dont know what you dont know
6609444 the withdrawal of the russian troops which have reinforced the peacekeepers from the territory of georgia is going according to plan and will be completed in 10 days
6609445 on august 22 eight checkpoints will be established in the security zone in which 500 peacekeepers will be deployed no more than that
6609446 other peacekeepers will be moved to south ossetia while other troops will be moved to russia
6609447 i want to state this clearly and unequivocally that russia is carrying out in full the six principles agreed between medvedev and sarkozy
6609448 we have the right under certain conditions to advance to the boundaries of the whole zone of responsibility
6609449 at the first stage we will set up eight outposts less than a battalion 272 men and later a second line of outposts already along the administrative border of ossetia which of course need to be equipped from the point of view of engineering and be prepared for providing support to peacekeepers
6609450 the transition had been tremendously smooth and its clear that were passing an enormous milestone towards reaching uss george washingtons ultimate forward deployment assignment to the western pacific and indian oceans
6609451 we are particularly excited to foster a new era in our long standing relationship with our host nation of japan and the city of yokosuka
6609452 you can see a lot of difference in the students faces
6609453 the students are good here without help but we see that our government cares about us its been a month and a half since they came to our school and asked what we needed and since then we have seen good progress
6609454 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children
6609455 this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6609456 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children
6609457 we dont have a lot of money but i see a bright future for schools in this area what matters most is the students are interested in studying and learning and the people here see the value in education
6609458 the election is the best way to renew a political team to outline new policy for achieving those strategically correct goals that our country has
6609459 the presence of a huge and powerful parliamentary majority and the weakness of the opposition
6609460 the situation is in fact the same now or even worse
6609461 i am more than sure that right now i have to play a very active role in the country
6609462 at least from now on our policies any step taken by us must always be carefully thought through with a cold mind only then will we be able to really achieve the goals that the georgian government has
6609463 there is in the short term a recognition that there should be an area where russia can conduct some additional military activities but that is a temporary measure until the osce monitors are in place and can do the job that russian forces would otherwise have to do
6609464 and then that is to be followed in turn in principle by a peacekeeping force so this is not a carte blanche
6609465 a right to have a military and we should all be working on how we can help them rebuild after the damage that has been inflicted
6609466 what happens between now and then including russias actions will make a difference
6609467 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6609468 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6609469 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6609470 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6609471 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6609472 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6609473 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6609474 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat
6609475 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6609476 there are more people who might be expecting to get a share and more to feel resentment
6609477 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6609478 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6609479 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6609480 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6609481 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6609482 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6609483 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6609484 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6609485 when i wager guys doing cartwheels in the modify zone id same to intend discover there same we did in the older days and wager how some cartwheels theyd be doing then
6609486 that at the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate
6609487 weve certainly expressed our position over the fact that these humvees are u s property and should be returned its that simple
6609488 we dont have any assurance at this point that theyre prepared to do the right thing and return them
6609489 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6609490 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6609491 everyone knows about the role israel and its military consultants played in the georgia crisis
6609492 we are not planning to slam the door and they are also keeping the door open everything depends on the priorities that nato chooses not on us
6609493 if these priorities move toward reckless support for saakashvilis bankrupt regime and if the price they are ready to pay is to sever relations with russia this is not our choice
6609494 intended to rubber stamp a russian interpretation that we do not agree with
6609495 an international discussion of lasting security and stability arrangements for south ossetia and abkhazia
6609496 all of abkhazia all those who could from every corner of abkhazia came to freedom square in sukhum today
6609497 of course those who are sick stayed at ahome but most of the people were on the square today expressing their will expressing their view about our independence which was in fact already vocalized in the 1999 referendum
6609498 and i wanted to do something that would express this tremendous emotion that is shared by absolutely everybody in russia
6609499 recent events in south ossetia have shown that only russia can protect small nations against georgias genocide
6609500 russia is carrying out its peacekeeping duty it has done everything to end this havoc and is now taking measures to deal with the aftermath of the humanitarian disaster
6609501 if i were in russias place id be very careful with what i promise
6609502 the problem is that russias recognition of abkhazia or both territories wont really change the situation
6609503 moscow is unlike the united states which in the instance of kosovo had the backing of a certain number of countries who recognized kosovo
6609504 moscow doesnt have that possibility no one is going to follow us the prospects for international recognition in the instance of a unilateral act by russia in my view are much more complicated and the situation will end up if not entirely then at least partly at a dead end
6609505 is not about geopolitics not a struggle for spheres of influence it is a moral action the defense of the weak for whom no one but russia will stand up
6609506 the goal of georgian president mikheil saakashvili to bolster his authority and remain as president
6609507 in these judgments in favor of south ossetia and against georgia we see the readiness of our citizens to accept and support the official point of view and an ability to swallow enormous doses of unreliable and false information combined with the absence of a willingness to subject that information to independent critical analysis
6609508 compared to the previous night when there was lots of movement all night it was a much quieter night
6609509 this time it was only around 3 a m when we heard the engines of military vehicles and there were no explosions like the previous night the checkpoints that were reestablished late yesterday august 20 including here in the city of gori are still operating
6609510 i have to note though that the number of soldiers manning those checkpoints is down i can already recognize soldiers by their appearance so i know when those faces change
6609511 i can say that all of the people who arrived yesterday were new soldiers and the local authorities contacted them and they said that most of them are ethnic chechens and they claimed that they came only to protect the city i should stress that these are russian army regulars
6609512 ukraine is a reliable business partner we will honor all obligations under the existing treaties
6609513 russia should start without delay making preparations for the withdrawal of its fleet in 2017
6609514 we do not understand the position of russia which simply refuses to discuss the issue but let me assure you that in any event after 2017 there will be no russian fleet on our soil
6609515 an urgent proposition to launch talks and draw up an agreement to regulate bilateral relations during military operations
6609516 the security is very good and we are conducting training and joint operations with the coalition forces
6609517 weve sent a company to each checkpoint to train and live with the coalition forces
6609518 the forces out in wasit right now will be a professional force the iraqis can be proud of
6609519 i say that based on what ive seen this isf do theyre positive professional and they want to do a good job
6609520 we controlled the border between the two provinces and weve been very successful at preventing smugglers from entering into wasit
6609521 having the isf at the checkpoints will not degrade any operation they are conducting
6609522 it will create a more flexible and professional force as we conduct joint operations from the checkpoints to other areas

6609532 adem s prevalece la estigmatizaci n gubernamental sobre el trabajo de los periodistas por si fuera poco son muy fr giles o inexistentes los mecanismos y manuales de prevenci n y protecci n para la seguridad de medios y periodistas
6609533 alta concentraci n de medios de comunicaci n en pocas personas o grupos empresariales vinculados a diferentes ramas de la econom a y con sectores con enorme poder pol tico empresarial y religioso
6609534 en el caso de los reporteros freelance esta situaci n es a n m s grave
6609535 esa actitud favorecer lo que la misi n ha identificado como uno de los retos m s importantes a los que se enfrenta el gobierno mexicanos la impunidad en los casos de asesinatos desapariciones y agresiones contra periodistas que representan una de las formas extremas de censura y que se recrudece cuando no existe castigo para los responsables
6609536 hay que apoyar a la selecci n mexicana y cuando un jugador que hace diferencia y es extranjero naturalizado mexicano hay que aplaudirlo pero cuando un jugador que en su posici n hay 10 en el futbol mexicano creo que no hay necesidad de llevar un jugador as
6609537 ayer creo que no hizo diferencia y eso es en lo que no estoy de acuerdo para nada es como en un equipo cuando viene un extranjero tiene que marcar diferencia si no me quedo con los que est n aqu en el club que vienen de fuerzas b sicas
6609538 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6609539 para dejarlo perfectamente claro sin recursos presupuestales urgentes el ife estar imposibilitado de garantizar el cumplimiento cabal de las nuevas responsabilidades en materia de radio y televisi n
6609540 la eficacia de las leyes no escapa de las restricciones econ micas de hecho exigen de factibilidad presupuestal por ello es procedente se alar que el monto otorgado por la secretar a de hacienda es insuficiente
6609541 el pa s tiene tambi n muchas necesidades importantes en otras materias pero nada puede ser m s apremiante y m s importante que contar con un proceso electoral en 2009 que garantice equidad y transparencia y adem s brinde el mensaje a los ciudadanos de que su voto va a ser respetado
6609542 esperaremos hasta ma ana nos juntaremos el cuerpo t cnico y m dico para ver si realmente lo que nos mostr en toda la semana omar est como para ser tomado en cuenta
6609543 the only way theyre going to turn the ship around is bringing to market compelling products that are competitively priced
6609544 tienen que analizar qu es lo que m s conviene a los pueblos ind genas del per y no en base solamente a asuntos de car cter pol tico o por hacer oposici n
6609545 espero que la decisi n que tome ma ana el parlamento en esa discusi n sea no de car cter pol tico y de pura verborrea sino sobre lo que verdaderamente le conviene m s al pa s y a las comunidades nativas
6609546 si apoyan a las comunidades para hacer otras cosas tambi n pueden comunic rseles estos temas
6609547 todas las cosas tienen que terminar alg n d a
6609548 esto no es ninguna novedad es como la s tima vez que me levantan el secreto bancario y el secreto tributario hoy nos lo comunicaron y se va a citar a otras personas del ministerio todos sabemos de donde viene esto si es el congresista reggiardo no solo l nunca he visto a un ministro de educaci n cuestionar los estatutos est clara la persecuci n pol tica contra la federaci n por mantener nuestra institucionalidad
6609549 pueden levantarle el secreto bancario a quien quiera estoy tranquilo en la parte familiar y en cuanto a la gente qu est alrededor de m en la federaci n que se quiera levantar al secreto bancario a mi familia me da razones para fundamentar lo que vengo diciendo sobre una persecuci n
6609550 hace seis a os pretendieron denunciarnos a nosotros y terminaron denunciados los funcionarios del ipd
6609551 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6609552 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6609553 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6609554 eso se acab porque no le van a dar un ning n t tulo de propiedad todas las zonas populares tienen 20 y 30 a os invirti ndoles todas las semanas un saco de cemento uno de arena unos ladrillos un juego de cabillas etc y hoy en d a el estado le va a decir que eso no es de ellos
6609555 el mensaje que nos est dando es que nosotros nicamente vamos a poder usar lo que tenemos no vamos a poder ni disfrutar ni disponer ni venderlo
6609556 vayan a ver la contaminaci n en los pueblos de pertigalete y guanta
6609557 porque los irresponsables de cemex nunca invirtieron en tecnolog a para eliminar ese polvillo
6609558 no les importa contaminar gente y playa lo de ellos es ganancia dinero pero no para invertir aqu sino para llev rselo
6609559 los mexicanos de la empresa cemex han sido irrespetuosos porque ellos en el fondo tienen algunos de esos gerentes con complejo de superioridad se sienten m s del norte y creen que nosotros somos macacos
6609560 el estado nacional el estado socialista a venezuela le estaban quitando todo el poder un pa s como era venezuela tomado por el poder transnacional no pod a ni podr a caminar por su propio pie
6609561 mr upshaw i know you were a member of the oakland raiders and we just hired the raiders former head coach bill callahan im just wondering what you thought of him and whether you think hell be able to turn get the program back on track
6609562 once a raider always a raider and they never let you forget
6609563 we hadnt beaten italy in a long long time so why not now its the olympics its the most important time why not now then we said we lost to cuba in the preliminaries so why not now why not beat them today we win when it counts
6609564 i am more happy for the players they deserve for it its their dream this is a great moment i would like to share with them
6609565 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6609566 to act is to live to embody the dreams of man
6609567 we didnt want to parody inspirational teacher movies we wanted to make a movie about a guy who thinks hes living an inspirational teacher movie
6609568 this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6609569 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6609570 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6609571 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6609572 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6609573 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6609574 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6609575 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6609576 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6609577 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6609578 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6609579 leonard can find anybody hes the best in the business
6609580 you cant hide from him if he can talk to casey anthony he will get enough information to find out what happened to caylee you have to keep in mind that we have a better chance than the police of getting information out of somebody most people clam up when they see a badge they fear the police whereas they can trust us
6609581 aparentemente dos hombres hicieron estallar los explosivos fuera de la f brica durante un cambio de turno
6609582 la f brica de wah dispone de un f rreo dispositivo de seguridad para controlar qui n accede y abandona el recinto pero cualquier persona puede aproximarse sin problemas a alguna de las numerosas puertas
6609583 la guerra contra el terror no se puede ganar a la defensiva tenemos que lleva la batalla a las puertas de los extremistas
6609584 no nos ataca un ej rcito extranjero o conocido nuestro enemigo merodea en silencio dentro de nuestra sociedad esta es nuestra propia guerra
6609585 sacar de su escondite al terrorista sin rostro obstruir sus planes y hacer frente a las peores amenazas antes de que emerjan
6609586 theyre just not sure how much fun barack obama would be in a duck blind
6609587 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6609588 even for very young children unstructured creative time in the classroom is waning as teachers and administrators are under growing pressures to measure school readiness through rote learning and increased homework in her new book vivian gussin paley decries this rapid disappearance of creative time and makes the case for the critical role of fantasy play in the psychological intellectual and social development of young children
6609589 how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk
6609590 were very pleased to see one more tool that we can use to have whats a nutritious good product become even safer
6609591 but were hearing on the order of three to five cents per pound which is not all that much to guarantee safety
6609592 it will be a business decision basically to see if customers are willing to purchase this or not
6609593 i see this probably starting off small to see how consumers will react to it and then perhaps grow to some point
6609594 may not be the futuristic cure all the fda is looking for
6609595 we still think that good agricultural practices good sanitation practices good manufacturing practices are all absolutely essential and actually should be mandated in addition to providing for this choice of irradiation
6609596 irradiation in the production processing and handling of food final rule
6609597 i think the salient point is that we have notified them
6609598 given that an investigation is proceeding weve got no comment to make
6609599 im so mad i could kill her could be taken out of context by someone viewing your youtube video whether it is a video blog or not
6609600 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6609601 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6609602 my 10 year experience with the mngop has left me with the view that its extremely difficult for a pro choice or pro gay civil union member of the republican party to advance to any stage of leadership in this state let alone delegate to the rnc indeed it can be difficult at times even to keep hold on ones very credibility once word of such a liberal stance gets out
6609603 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6609604 since late april or the beginning of may weve cleaned up graffiti on lake street from the target store at the minnehaha mall to west river road two or three times
6609605 about a year and half ago we started a huge mural project to get the whole community involved especially at risk kids
6609606 were getting to the point where almost every alley in our neighborhood has been covered
6609607 taggers want a big open space and a mural takes that away plus i think the gangs who are responsible for a lot of the graffiti tend to respect work that comes from the community
6609608 we did a great mural project a few saturdays ago
6609609 near lake street and longfellow avenue where most of our volunteers were latino kids that lived on the block
6609610 people see us on the street and ask to be put on
6609611 the corcoran mural project was awarded with council member gary schiffs neighborhood project of the year this february
6609612 i was really surprised because we were competing with projects from throughout the 9th ward
6609613 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6609614 our goal is to put on the best convention possible to put our best foot forward
6609615 they said that if you are already a member of the black chamber you automatically were considered a preferred vendor and would be listed
6609616 no one ever asked for a list of our members apparently they made no effort to be inclusive
6609617 we were looking at providing a mobile registration solution for the republican national committee to speed up the delegate check in process i called three or four times within a two week period but never got a call back
6609618 i sincerely hope there is still interest in using my work
6609619 please let me know the next steps that i can take to bring this to fruition
6609620 there is no excuse that this consideration of her publication didnt happen
6609621 both convention bureaus people talked about getting on this preferred businesses list
6609622 i think they had that big meeting to show people hey we reached out to the community now its up to them what they do with it
6609623 as far as i was concerned it was a way to get people to pay 425 to become a member of the different convention and visitors bureaus
6609624 if they really wanted diversity you can go to the black pages and find restaurants
6609625 you can work with those communities of color but you have to have someone dedicated to making sure that they do that
6609626 just dont do it by having a meeting and saying come to me at this certain time you actually have to do some outreach
6609627 if your goal is to make an outreach to a particular segment hispanic asian black and your goal is to reach out to that segment then the onus is on you
6609628 but if i want to say that i am mightier than god sit back and whoever comes to me maybe we throw some business their way if thats the attitude chances are there are not going to be a lot of minority owned businesses that are going to come to you
6609629 to try to get to the power players of the republican national convention
6609630 thats not right we should have diversity in everything we the republican party do
6609631 from blacks who are coming from out of town to the convention wanting to know where can they go to get their hair done where to go to get some soul food where can they go to church where can they find beauty products or where can they find places of special interest to them
6609632 it never occurred to them that somebody might need something different from the mainstream
6609633 we will be in the position to direct people looking for different cultures et cetera
6609634 i think lots of people will be visiting the twin cities because of the convention but may not necessarily be on the convention floor
6609635 the convention opens on a monday and some people will come for the weekend beforehand or they will stay after the convention ends and use this as part of their vacation i also think that not only the delegates will be coming but they might bring their families who wont be at the convention but will be out in the community wanting to spend money
6609636 my hope is that black businesses in our community will see that type of benefit
6609637 we are going to see when this is all over with just how much money they brought to the black community
6609638 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed
6609639 estamos con el presidente de la rep blica en este asunto que nos afecta y nos compromete a todos todos por la seguridad de todos sin sacarle la vuelta cerrar filas sin regatear compromisos sin eludir responsabilidades por el contrario existe plena disposici n para coordinar voluntades y para aterrizar aciones que den respuesta a la exigencia de un alto a la violencia y de mayor seguridad
6609640 as we stand here i still absolutely believe that my client is innocent
6609641 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6609642 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6609643 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess
6609644 i honestly dont know why it went the way it did this is the first time ive heard all this stuff that the d a is putting out that is not my child
6609645 hemos tenido una operaci n exitosa del auditorio y una asistencia importante del p blico no solo de la ciudad sino de la regi n el 30 de los asistentes provienen de fuera de guadalajara de los estados circunvecinos principalmente y han generado una derrama para la ciudad en ocho meses equivalente al costo completo del auditorio
6609646 tanto por ocupaci n hotelera como por alimentos bebidas transporte y servicios adem s del costo propio del boleto
6609647 contamos con recursos federales estatales y municipales gracias a los cuales hemos logrado avanzar
6609648 ha invertido s lo el 21 del total del patrimonio construido del ccu en l quido lo que representa en los siete a os que llevamos operando el 0 6 del gasto total de la universidad en estos a os
6609649 estamos en marcha con la inversi n privada y con la infraestructura vial para las 300 mil personas que habitan en las zonas aleda as se ala de font re ulx y esperamos recibir estas inversiones en las mejores condiciones para la universidad
6609650 no yo creo que el ccu sigue su marcha lo que sucede es un factor que tiene que ver con la percepci n que la gente tiene sobre lo que se est haciendo en la universidad y obviamente el ccu es parte de ello pero en sentido estricto no afecta la operaci n sigue todo en pie tenemos los recursos para completar la biblioteca las gestiones para la inversi n privada y estamos pr ximos a cerrar algunas operaciones de tal forma que no lo que ocurre en la universidad que espero se resuelva no afecta al ccu
6609651 el ccu sigue su marcha y creo que no tendremos por qu tener mayores inconvenientes en un futuro
6609652 mira observa no respires aprieta el disparador de la c mara y sigue caminando

6609659 aunque me gustar a que fuera m s grande ese es uno de los proyectos a largo plazo
6609660 por ejemplo recuerda el organizador de repente nos llegan noticias de un proyecto muy interesante de c mic nacional que se est haciendo entre seis personas luego nos enteramos que se pelaron y nada m s siguen cuatro luego dos y al final se estanca y todos siguen discutiendo as sucede de manera usual

6609665 manny got a stolen base to get us going the bullpen did a great job
6609666 it seemed like dodgers catcher russell martin never moved his glove from where he set up
6609667 i threw him six or seven splits last night i started him with a breaking ball he had to be looking for it i got a little mad started turning it loose
6609668 its very challenging to win a game when you score one run
6609669 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6609670 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6609671 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion

6609701 im cool with it theres things he dont like about me theres things i dont like about him i refuse to be like him and he refuses to be like me
6609702 the minute you tell someone someone tells that and then you end up paranoid and blaming people so i thought the best way to do it was to tell no one
6609703 were not god heads and we dont go to church or anything
6609704 its just were talking about love life religion death but not in a morbid way angels and shit like that it is what it is
6609705 people are sort of going on about this tribute to john lennon its not a tribute to john

6609714 and the good news is weve got plenty more to come
6609715 after working at a public library in a small rural midwestern town which i will refer to as denialville michigan throughout this book for fifteen years i have encountered strains and variations of crazy i didnt know existed in such significant portions of our population
6609716 the library diaries reads like seinfeld meets lou dobbs meets glenn beck
6609717 open this book and youll meet the naked patron the greedy unenlightened patrons destination hell the masturbator horny old men mr three hats and a menagerie of other characters you never dreamt were housed at your public library
6609718 while you stop short of naming the individuals you targeted in your book your detailed descriptions of their unique characteristics and mannerisms make them easily identifiable in our small community
6609719 the idea that the universe is worth studying just because its worth studying is a religious idea
6609720 if you think the universe is fundamentally good and that its an expression of a good god then studying how the universe works is a way of becoming intimate with the creator its a kind of worship and thats been a big motivation for doing any kind of science
6609721 a hundred years ago we didnt understand the big bang
6609722 now that we have the understanding of a universe that is big and expanding and changing we can ask philosophical questions we would not have known to ask like what does it mean to have multiverses these are wonderful questions science isnt going to answer them but science by telling us what is there causes us to ask these questions it makes us go back to the seven days of creation which is poetry beautiful poetry with a lesson underneath it and say oh the seventh day is god resting as a way of reminding us that god doesnt do everything god built this universe but gave you and me the freedom to make choices within the universe
6609723 the purpose of your academy is precisely to discern and to make known in the present state of science and within its proper limits what can be regarded as an acquired truth or at least as enjoying such a degree of probability that it would be imprudent and unreasonable to reject it
6609724 the human being is often considered an assembly of parts and elements that can be cut and pasted rather than a biological organism and a person of spiritual worth
6609725 the idea that the universe is worth studying just because its worth studying is a religious idea

6609739 we have had a great spirit of co operation with the federal government in pioneering wind energy production over the last 10 15 years and already p e i is generating 18 per cent of its energy from renewable wind owned by the people of the island

6609779 i might as well sell an offset for when i turn my bedroom light off at night
6609780 as a long term strategy it could be quite detrimental
6609781 they are somewhat esoteric markets as they are when people see things that seemingly dont have any additionality it increases skepticism
6609782 one of the reasons weve steered clear of sequestration and soil sequestration projects is precisely that some of these have questions around additionality so we dont do any of that project type
6609783 if you make the stipulations too onerous and too expensive then you might not get anyone to come and play in your market
6609784 have to think hard and fast about the trade offs in sacrificing quality in the name of trading volumes
6609785 don and i have served together in congress for many years and i consider him a friend
6609786 don has been an outspoken voice against environmental extremists over the years and has strongly opposed the types of federal regulatory overreach advocated in the name of environmentalism
6609787 socialism nothing more than the theory that the slave is always more virtuous than his master
6609788 up dont blame your fat kids on an anything but what you do and how you raise them it is called parenting try it sometime we would be a lot better off if we had more of it accuse mccain of wrong doing does not work now lets find out more about obama and his dealings with terrorists
6609789 this is an example of when you add the potential costs of the potential solutions voters are going to back off from their support of ideals

6609791 he enjoyed the relationship he established with the people who recruited him
6609792 its a successful top 25 program that has the opportunity to win a national championship
6609793 he doesnt play tight end for us because of the type of offense we run but he can do that at the next level if he doesnt put on the needed weight to be an offensive lineman
6609794 he enjoyed the relationship he established with the people who recruited him
6609795 its a successful top 25 program that has the opportunity to win a national championship

6609797 this record is more about action time for talk is over now its time to actually do something
6609798 then the song builds to a nice restrained david gilmour ish guitar solo
6609799 the song is obviously about the iraq war but rundgren leaves the door open to let it be just about any type of work being contracted out
6609800 and again another great guitar break in the middle of this song love it
6609801 the modulation into the instrumental section of the song is a nice touch
6609802 rundgren interestingly adds some white noise during the ending guitar solo to create some tension a la the beatles

6609817 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6609818 he felt really lonely and he wanted to be with his mother and family
6609819 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6609820 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6609821 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement
6609822 i will play the role of a midwife if the negotiating parties want delivery of the baby
6609823 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6609824 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6609825 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6609826 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6609827 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6609828 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6609829 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6609830 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6609831 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly
6609832 in the end a regular commerce site came in and found a way to steal ebays thunder
6609833 ebay is bleeding and its going to have to step up and stem the bleeding
6609834 coalition leaders are expected to meet friday the talks will focus on the the judges issue
6609835 they rehman and wali are mediating and we hope they will come up with a solution
6609836 how could you even think of your pain when this little girl has such a burden to carry
6609837 the only good thing about hitting your head against the wall is that it feels so good to stop
6609838 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
6609839 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
6609840 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or secondary cancer

6609845 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6609846 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6609847 its a bit like if you have got a family pet when the vet says to you there is nothing more we can do and the animal is suffering ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6609848 it was absolutely disgusting we had five minutes and during that time they euthanized poor colin
6609849 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes all he needed is a mothers milk
6609850 i make this point not to simply give john mccain a hard time its indicative of a different world view about whats happening in america
6609851 you dont need to have a nobel prize in economics to understand that the economy has not been making progress for most people
6609852 does a guy who made more than four million dollars last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6609853 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of
6609854 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6609855 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6609856 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6609857 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6609858 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
6609859 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6 00 am local time 0200 gmt all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6609860 over the course of august 22 the retreat of all these forces in georgia will be completed
6609861 only the russian peacekeeping soldiers in numbers required to ensure security will remain within the limits of the security zone at specially installed posts
6609862 the defence ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6609863 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6609864 if this is the best time of my life im in a lot of trouble
6609865 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6609866 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6609867 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6609868 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful
6609869 the white house that wants to keep track of all your e mail and phone records cant even keep track of their own
6609870 to take the brilliant opportunity to create a truly green development by supporting the gazettement and management of large parts of the delta as conservation areas and tailoring development activities to small schemes that will directly benefit the local people and maintain the hydrological and ecological integrity of one of kenyas most important natural assets
6609871 the community doubts the sincerity of the government mumias sugar and tarda and the way the project is being brought here
6609872 tarda acquired the land illegally and they are now forcing a project on the community they should leave the pastoralists alone
6609873 implementation of the second and third phases will depend on the success of the first phase
6609874 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6609875 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6609876 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6609877 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6609878 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6609879 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
6609880 very small segment of advertisers within the next day or two

6609917 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6609918 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6609919 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6609920 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6609921 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6609922 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6609923 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6609924 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6609925 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6609926 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6609927 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6609928 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6609929 real life goes on its not just about the building and the redskins and here we go and now were playing the carolina panthers it really is about the real life situations and theyre hard
6609930 but the one thing is we have a real tight family in the building when you lose a member it obviously hurts a lot more when youre tight knit but you also know youve got a lot of people around to support you
6609931 he has been very strong very real about this situation
6609932 the conversations hes had with my coaches have been very upbeat talking about the little victories each day each day he has considered a real blessing that his daughter has been alive to communicate with him and her mom i could see the pride he had in how his daughter was fighting this illness thats what came through these last couple of weeks
6609933 it really took my breath away when i saw the message come across my desk
6609934 i just stopped and immediately thought about all the times that we played against each other we didnt like each other when we played against each other but he was a tremendous athlete a tremendous leader he made a very deep mark in the history of the nfl and hell be greatly missed
6609935 i think we are urged within our hearts to press on
6609936 and grit our teeth a little bit and bear down when these things happen
6609937 a type of stew widely eaten in west africa including ghana liberia sierra leone and nigeria the word palaver comes from the portuguese language and means a talk lengthy debate or quarrel it is unclear how this led to the name of the stew one theory is that when the stew was first made with long ropey greens people would start quarrels by slapping each other with the greens from their stew
6609938 if you are pro choice and identify with the republican party i urge you to become involved your voice your vote and your activism are needed

6609940 one of the signs of mans true understanding fiqh is his compassion towards himself by adopting a simple life
6609941 the sign of mans true understanding fiqh also involves his personal conduct where he goes from where he comes who he sits with and his perseverance in oft soliciting to sit in the company of the learned ones
6609942 why do i find your scholars departing from this world and yet your ignorant ones refuse to learn surely the one who teaches what is good and beneficial and the one who learns them receive equal reward and besides these two categories humanity is at loss
6609943 adorn them as you please and this will surely help boost their ego and self deception
