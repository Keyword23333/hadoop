4910005 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4910006 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4910007 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4910008 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4910009 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4910010 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4910011 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4910012 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4910013 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4910014 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4910015 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4910016 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4910017 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4910018 we still see the next few months as being quite rough
4910019 the cycle has turned and the australian dollar likely has more downside ahead of it possibly taking it back to around us0 80
4910020 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilise or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4910021 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4910022 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4910023 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4910024 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4910025 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4910026 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4910027 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4910028 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4910029 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4910030 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4910031 were calling it a contusion right now im not concerned
4910032 theres a chance he could have but you still always want to protect yourself
4910033 while he was in there i thought he was sharp
4910034 getting out of the pocket and making plays is something were going to be doing this year
4910035 i think troy and kyle by the basis of practice so far have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
4910036 we didnt stop them and a lot of that came from jackson scrambling
4910037 i went in a little earlier than i expected and felt pretty comfortable
4910038 when you go in with those guys you just have to step up

4910077 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4910078 jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
4910079 he called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness these are the names of the twelve apostles first simon who is called peter and his brother andrew james son of zebedee and his brother john philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus simon the zealot and judas iscariot who betrayed him
4910080 ask the lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field
4910081 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
4910082 be a sinner and sin boldly but believe and rejoice in christ even more boldly pray boldly you too are a mighty sinner
4910083 a student is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
4910084 so do not be afraid of them there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known what i tell you in the dark speak in the daylight what is whispered in your ear proclaim from the roofs do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell
4910085 whoever acknowledges me before men i will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven but whoever disowns me before men i will disown him before my father in heaven
4910086 in view of gods infinite care for the cheapest in nature and for the smallest detail in the crown of creation man
4910087 but whoever disowns me before men i will disown him before my father in heaven
4910088 whoever acknowledges me before men i will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven
4910089 if you confess the lord jesus with your mouth and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
4910090 mass of other pilgrims who far from seeking the sacred center of a rapidly developing settler cosmology visit the rock for no other reason than the simple fact that it is there
4910091 the handrail was against my knee but i was actually lucky
4910092 if it was two feet to the side they said it would have cut me in half
4910093 science was a subject i enjoyed in school i loved being outside i loved baseball and id taken care of peoples lawns growing up
4910094 i thought somebodys got to take care of the baseball fields
4910095 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of
4910096 next generation fibre channel storage systems market forecast 2007 2011
4910097 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualize the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
4910098 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
4910099 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
4910100 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
4910101 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
4910102 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion

4910105 since were only on day four of our implementation lets just say if apps were on my baseball team it would be hitting at the bottom of the lineup
4910106 for me as the google apps administrator the disruption was pretty damn irritating aside from getting kicked out of e mail i need to do my own job it also forced me to completely refocus on figuring out whats happening with gmail and google apps
4910107 it was constant troubleshooting testing research posting to the google apps forums and so on plus theres the emotional strain of wondering whether you completely screwed up by moving everyone to google apps as our sole e mail system thats what freaked me out did google just make me look like an idiot
4910108 mostly that 20 percent drop is based on fear of another perhaps more damaging outage it hasnt happened but now i know it could happen any time and without warning and if it does i have virtually no recourse to get the service running again
4910109 if we began to experience a similar outage more than about two or three business hours per quarter wed probably make google apps and gmail a backup solution to a locally hosted mail system if we used it at all and it would likely be years before wed try a cloud based collaborative system again from any vendor
4910110 even though weve only had apps for a few days im already impressed with the customization options the ability to completely ditch outlook makes apps a worthwhile service to our company
4910111 the gmail interface feels more intuitive and is significantly quicker than outlook and the mobile accessibility is a huge improvement over our old e mail service
4910112 google understands its tremendous responsibility to keep things up and running
4910113 no ones happy when theres downtime but theres always downtime ive seen exchange go down often many times youre left to your own it people to fix it that can be good or bad id rather it be googles problem theyve got a world class team their reputation is on the line over time theyre going to get better and better
4910114 as a small organization looking at pre google apps practice if it had been my hardware in house that went down i would not have had anywhere near the reaction time and response to be restored as google did with the apps service
4910115 still down 24 hours and counting this ceased to be funny long ago any of the other users here have any recommendations for another e mail provider its time to start voting with our feet and leaving for greener pastures
4910116 we know how important gmail is to our users so we take issues like this very seriously and we apologize for the inconvenience we encourage anyone having technical difficulty to visit the gmail or google apps discussion groups where were posting status updates
4910117 id bring those guards back if i were you im not in a very good mood
4910118 i make it a policy to never question the word of anyone who wears that uniform
4910119 over the past 30 years they have sought to impose a number of embargoes against iran in an attempt to block the path of our progress all those sanctions turned the country into a nuclear power
4910120 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
4910121 this is a sure way to remind everyone we live in a dangerous world filled with people like myself who actually want to go to war if it involves a very small nation that cant fight back
4910122 la empresa privada ha ofrecido la construcci n de 1000 y pico de viviendas en chincha 1500 en ica 1000 y pico en ca ete y 2 mil en pisco

4910125 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4910126 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
4910127 shes bubbly and the room lights up when she walks in because everybody sticks to her
4910128 doesnt want to get too much into because of people close to us who would get upset
4910129 yeah we did lose a few people close to us due to suicide and stuff like that
4910130 aware is for depression but it also has groups for suicidal people as well
4910131 thank god because it is an awful thing to have
4910132 i know a lot of people who do suffer from it it is not a very nice thing for their family
4910133 but what can you say to them when they are really down and when anything you do seems not to help at the minute in
4910134 we all had it really tough in the house like i cried a good few times it was once on tv when i really broke down that was because it was so stressful people dont realise how stressful it was everyone was breaking down i saw a complete and utter difference in
4910135 she was a completely different woman the day she left
4910136 when she walked in she was all happy with rosy cheeks in the end she was literally blocking everything out like a zombie she was on the verge of having a complete and utter breakdown
4910137 i suppose they must have been pro gay or they wouldnt have voted for me i know it has not only to do with me and joe because we were in there for a charity they were probably voting for the charity as well
4910138 nobody there were a few who look i loved everyone
4910139 i got on really well with michelle and before i went in there were people saying to me watch out for her
4910140 michelle is a very pretty girl but she is not my type and even if i wasnt in a relationship i still wouldnt be attracted to her but she is a good looking girl
4910141 a very good looking woman i tell you for her age
4910142 yeah i would definitely like to have children one day
4910143 i arrived on her door with my bags and said im here
4910144 because she sings and writes songs we had something in common
4910145 we were seeing each other a week or two before we decided to give it a go in a relationship
4910146 it is more open here in dublin about gay people than it would be in athlone
4910147 the way she looks at it is if im happy in life thats all that matters to her
4910148 shes happy if thats what makes me happy i just want to live my life happily
4910149 and it did the others but the thing was it hit me for some reason harder because maybe i was the middle child
4910150 growing up i would have had problems and difficult kinds of illnesses and panic attacks and stuff like that which i went to see someone about it all boiled down to him and absence in the family
4910151 completely stopped but it took a long time because in school i became very claustrophobic i didnt want to do anything i didnt want to go out i didnt want to go into town with my friends i was just into myself i just decided this isnt working im just pulling myself down and im not going to get anywhere in life i said i was going to go and do something with my life today then i took the opportunity to do youre a star and thats what got me out of it
4910152 a very quiet woman but strong to raise six children on her own and go through what she went through
4910153 i am 13 im gay but i dont know how to tell my parents
4910154 then we went on to do eurovision it was all really great fun
4910155 i have gone solo and hes gone solo we have both had phonecalls offers following the show tv work etc there is a lot of feedback now about myself and joe saying that the future is looking bright
4910156 a lot of people have come to like us from just being on the show that was a really good thing yeah hopefully now things will go well for us since i was child i always wanted to sing
4910157 and i am going to get an album together and ill probably do a bit of tv work you just have to keep going we were knocked back bigtime when we didnt get through the semi finals of eurovision and we kept going and thats what im going to do
4910158 but i have a gin and tonic every now and again i find it helps me to mind my own business would you like one
4910159 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like bunch of girls next to the dubliners
4910160 she can have my autograph but shell have to come over to me im 72
4910161 i got an opportunity in my last contract to do what was best for me and my family i gave my word when i signed i want to fulfill that commitment some players might have jumped ship im not that type of a player i am here for a reason i want to see it through
4910162 i dont know if the trade is ironic because of the hgh thing
4910163 i think its more ironic because its the team that beat us i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason lets put it that way putting on that red sox jersey may take a minute or two the bottom line is ive played for in philadelphia and they have a good thing going over there
4910164 i think hes probably kept his emotions in check better
4910165 he still has his moments but i dont think id trade that because thats what drives him
4910166 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4910167 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4910168 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out friday will definitely be a much better day this week but we want to keep building on the momentum
4910169 i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
4910170 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4910171 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization

4910174 2006 date in a statement released the same day as edwards interview debuted on nightline august 8 yet dbkp has uncovered new info about those last days of 2006 how hunter was still
4910175 i was with the edwards campaign similarly filming behind the scenes video when he launched his campaign in new orleans in december 2006 after nola we went to iowa where edwards drew a huge crowd there was a celebratory mood in the air as we got back on the edwards jet to fly to new hampshire on that flight there was a lot of booze and elation excitement and hope edwards was in the back of the plane with reille and a couple of other campaign staffers i remember edwards turning on his ipod and grooving his head around i went back to use the bathroom and when i came out decided to chat with reille she was very outgoing maybe even flirtatious but really nice i asked how she got the gig filming webisodes and she said she met him in a bar and they clicked and she proposed some online documentary showing his authenticity she told me about some hollywood sitcom writing and other weird projects shed been involved with nothing id ever heard of

4910182 maybe its a little bit of fatigue you dont notice it your legs feel like theyre underneath you but youve got seven months of baseball under you now
4910183 but he did keep us in the game youve got to give him credit for that
4910184 but its a regular game with or without them i have to try to do my best
4910185 dallas braden is using it a lot keeping guys off balance i watch him the way he throws it what situation he throws it in
4910186 a quiet unassuming man who shunned the spotlight but was proficient at what he did
4910187 he could motivate anyone and he motivated a lot of different ways my face mask was bent on several occasions but 10 minutes later his arm was around your shoulder
4910188 he was the best all around football player i ever saw
4910189 ability is what gets you to the top but its character that keeps you there

4910193 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4910194 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4910195 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4910196 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4910197 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4910198 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge

4910203 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned
4910204 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4910205 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilise or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4910206 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4910207 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4910208 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4910209 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4910210 we still see the next few months as being quite rough
4910211 the cycle has turned and the australian dollar likely has more downside ahead of it possibly taking it back to around us0 80

4910225 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page

4910228 find it the center within hours since their main and often only source of income is recycling when they do they will also discover the gate into the back or west side of our complex but when they see the gate they will quickly figure out that our neighborhood would be a really great shortcut to the recycling center

4910230 our circulation figures are up over the last three years in particular we are up 35 percent this year and last year we were up10 percent
4910231 the economy could be a factor it seems when the economy doesnt do as well people turn to the library for interesting things to do that dont take money
4910232 research has shown that throughout the u s libraries contribute to economic development
4910233 its not up and ready yet but it will be soon
4910234 ive spoken with people at libraries from across the nation and even in those cities that arent losing population such as columbus circulation is up
4910235 this is true not only at the main library but at our branches in bridgeport and flushing
4910236 people there have told me they cant afford to go to the mall all the time or to travel needlessly
4910237 often they come here to read magazines and newspapers a lot of time people do cut back on books and magazines when they dont have the extra money we see entire families coming in during the evenings and doing a variety of things
4910238 there is high speed internet only within the villages dial up is what most people have and the speed here is an advantage to what they have at home
4910239 human contact the personal touch this is what kept him in business try to get that at starbucks or the lunch stop the asians knew how to run an efficient operation and they were workhorses but they couldnt make meaningful eye contact with their customers to save their lives
4910240 they believe that we must build an ark and some must be sacrificed but they have no doubt that they and their families have a reservation for a first class cabin

4910243 ill lose in the preseason as long we have the regular seasons weve had the last couple of years but its going to be a better plane ride than it would be if we lost
4910244 i dont think you can take winning for granted in this league
4910245 obviously we had a lot of mistakes on the defensive side of the ball but getting a win in this league we got that accomplished we did wrong can be corrected guys fought hard so i think its something we can build on
4910246 we didnt get that consistency because of the long runs were giving up
4910247 but i think were getting there guys are learning how we do things theyre getting to the sidelines communicating with our defensive coordinator and getting things ironed out
4910248 the biggest thing we take from tonight is we didnt let them get into the end zone
4910249 when they get into the red zone youve got to prevent them from getting touchdowns and keep the game in striking distance we came up with a victory
4910250 right now its preseason its really a test were trying to see what happens thats really a scenario that can happen during the regular season where we give up a long play let them get down in the red zone and we have to bounce back and recover from that play and stop them
4910251 we did that i look at it like thats a scenario we went through we did a good job it happened we learned from it we have to watch the tape and well learn from it guys will come back
4910252 it was the kind of night where we could be happy about a lot of individual performances especially from some of our younger guys
4910253 we still didnt get the sharpness we were looking for from our first units offensively and defensively offensively were still having a little trouble in the red zone punching the ball in when we get down there defensively we had some breakdowns and screwups on the run game early
4910254 we did keep them out of the end zone and forced five turnovers we kicked very well and covered well there were some things to build on
4910255 the big thing is we just have to be a lot sharper with our first offense and defense
4910256 i dont remember the last tight end to catch a pass here
4910257 if we keep will healthy then he should have a big year
4910258 he is going to be a guy who can catch the ball in the backfield he can block and he can play tight end hes 230 pounds and the young man has so many natural abilities
4910259 but i didnt think i was big enough at all or tall enough the usual tight ends are 6 6 280 i didnt see myself as that
4910260 i eat every time i get a chance to anytime somebody offers me food i take it im still gaining
4910261 its something i wasnt used to before its working out well
4910262 we have increased the passing game so were making more downfield plays and were trying to open the offense up
4910263 it will help the offense and it will give the defense something else to focus on besides pat and noel devine

4910322 i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
4910323 there are always some things we can clean up but it was one of those nights where everything clicked
4910324 you can say its the preseason and its going to be ok but i thought defensively we were poor
4910325 weve got to do a better job starting with the coaches myself and the people on that side of the ball

4910338 it is very simple someone says go and you go
4910339 we are mostly middle aged people in their 30s and 40s we race against teams that are 20 years younger and probably 20 pounds lighter
4910340 we beat them on a regular basis its all about going with the boat it is a very cool feeling when the boat goes
4910341 you will be able to bounce a nickel against your belly
4910342 in the next two weeks you are going to turn into an animal what kind of animal is up to you but its not going to be a bunny rabbit
4910343 if you are embarrassed by being called out in a crowd dont get in my boat
4910344 people get mad at me they call me names i dont care if they become better paddlers i have done my job its all in fun
4910345 he reminds me of my dad trying to teach me eighth grade algebra
4910346 if you dont think you are going to die during a race you arent paddling hard enough
4910347 it is not like baseball and volleyball and you miss the ball if you miss a stroke with your paddle the boat will still go
4910348 you gotta remember at the steel city dragons our charter is to get people in the boat it is not about making people crazy or scared
4910349 anytime you put 20 people in a little container and hand them a stick you sit back and see what happens
4910350 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4910352 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4910353 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4910354 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4910355 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4910356 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4910357 i was a simple sri lankan woman who always craved for a baby but when repeated attempts to have one failed i was devastated after 12 years of marriage i had almost embraced the reality of my 41 years of living that of being childless i loved life and god but felt let down by both
4910358 this one suggestion meant so much to me very soon everything fell in place and i am now a committed parent of one beautiful and loving daughter i strive to stay in the spirit of gratitude for i realise this is no small gift from both life and god
4910359 the fertility tourist traffic is definitely on the rise in bangalore affordable fertility services and legal comfort levels prevalent in the city prove to be attractive to foreign nationals
4910360 though most such couples are nris there are also couples of mixed races where either the husband or the wife is an indian
4910361 not because of the cost factor but because of the reputation it enjoys as far as fertility clinics are concerned
4910362 positive approach to pregnancy counselling reiki and pranayama my treatment is all this and more proving to be a big draw among maldivian nationals
4910363 though increasing worldwide interconnectedness is a major factor in promoting fertility tourism in the state it is the cost factor that brings most of them to bangalore and of course the easy availability of experts in the field
4910364 the fact that there is literally no waiting time and one is taken care of by highly qualified medical personnel who are fluent in english are added advantages also many of the doctors in bangalore are educated abroad and have practiced in many western countries adding to the long list of advantages
4910365 if some regulations are in place the traffic of fertility tourists in bangalore and subsequently in india can more than double in the next five 10 years
4910366 infrastructure in indian ivf clinics is 110 per cent better than the centres abroad and treatment in india is affordable too
4910367 if one gets same treatment at such a cheaper cost why wont they come to india
4910368 again cost factor is there it might take 100 000 to go for surrogacy in the us but in india it is only about rs 3 3 5 lakhs

4910381 it was a story you couldnt avoid even if you would like to have
4910382 im dying to find another liberal open their mouths where are they
4910383 what well find is cases where someone used to get a poor or barely acceptable signal that they now get a perfect picture and likewise people who got a poor picture before will get nothing in digital
4910384 it could be in a few situations that for a few moments the picture is perfect and then disappears and then comes back perfect
4910385 we cant simplify it down to the level wed all like it to be simplified to
4910386 the whole system is predicated on having a large outdoor antenna
4910387 we wanted to get a number of really good teams together in a pool play bracket tournament the first week of the season and weve had a good turnout with good competition
4910388 weve been flying under the radar and not getting much recognition so far but this is a big time event
4910389 theres always going to be nay sayers people who are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
4910390 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats going to mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships
4910391 thats kind of why i do the things preaching in prisons doing those different things trying to take advantage of that platform that god has blessed me with
4910392 the things he does he would be doing them even if he wasnt a heisman winner
4910393 no it is just that i carried him everywhere with me
4910394 we want to bring about a fundamental shift in our capacity to manage marine and coastal ecosystems
4910395 central to this project is the use of radio underwater
4910396 this technology could also apply to dams transport networks power distribution networks industrial processes and other complex process systems that currently involve substantial costs for monitoring
4910397 well develop a wireless system that is cost effective and simple to set up and use we wont reinvent existing technologies or methods but will instead build on and complement relevant work that is already underway in areas such as the great barrier reef
4910398 accurate and timely measurement of marine environments is vital to good management of our oceans and waterways and hence to the state of our terrestrial environments economies and health
4910399 this complements the it and network expertise in queensland and also utilises our leading edge knowledge of the environmental application and implementation of such systems
4910400 we need this system to streamline access to water data and models and to enable more effective water resource management it will give us the knowledge management and ict infrastructure to manage appropriately the new multi billion dollar water infrastructure underway in south east queensland and elsewhere
4910401 the clear goal of this research is sustainable healthy waterways and healthy ecosystems
4910402 it will be valuable for conservation industry and community organisations as well as researchers and educators
4910403 the initial advantages will be for south east queensland but subsequently other regions in australia and internationally will have access to customised services resulting from this project
4910404 it will be a significant advance on our current information systems as it will be designed so that good information underpins the management investments by healthy waterways partners
4910405 one of our priorities is to establish strong links with universities across the asia pacific region whereby we can combine the strengths of our research capabilities and resources with those of outstanding universities like uq
4910406 professor hunters water management research has the potential to benefit not only australia but countries throughout the region that through the increasing pressures of population growth urbanisation and climate change would benefit from more sophisticated approaches to water management

4910419 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned
4910420 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4910421 prendi oggi e cominci a pagare in comode rate fra sei mesi
4910422 we took pretty good drives we said we wanted to score points twice but that was more geared towards touchdowns weve just got to find a way to get the ball in the end zone we got a running game going and we converted some third downs it wasnt a great second week but we still got some things done
4910423 thats one of the things we talk about all week you cant go down and have a good drive and have a three and out it puts our defense in a bad spot even if you dont score points you should go out and hold the ball for a little while weve got to cut those out
4910424 people doubting this offensive line because theyre new shouldnt if im out there running around against a very good arizona team and a very good chicago team they need to start giving these guys some credit these guys open up these holes and make it easier for me to read sometimes its two holes open at the same time which is great for them
4910425 the offensive line keeps going those guys did a great job most important is all of us playing together and practicing together staying out there a little bit longer than we normally would during preseason games it was great for us to get that rhythm going and that started to happen
4910426 i knew they were going to come at me tonight but i didnt think it would be the first play from scrimmage that was a welcome to the nfl they had two pro bowl receivers out there and kept coming at me and i just had to respond
4910427 my dad was a cornerback and he used to have us line up and when the ball was thrown you had to win that battle thats a mindset a cornerback has to have to make plays and help his team win the ballgame
4910428 when they drafted me they drafted me as a complete corner you have to be physical to play this defense we jam a lot and we hit the running backs in the backfield a lot so were just taking all the challenges theyre throwing at me and ill check out the film and see what i need to correct and try to build up my game more throughout the preseason

4910443 a fully working desktop scaled demonstration prototype has already been constructed and has been fitted with a number of different die sets for different profiles
4910444 it has been demonstrated that different die designs can not only produce different transverse profiles but that it is also possible to produce either entirely straight or curved longitudinal shapes with traditionally extreme thickness to diameter ratios with difficult material such as stainless steel
4910445 the development of the continuous press forming machine is a testament to the universitys strength and engagement with industry partners
4910446 uq is highly committed to the project providing expert intellectual input and in kind support
4910447 manufacturing of the prototype will first occur in queensland and the design of dies associated software development and advisory services will be located here
4910448 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm

4910451 police attended and located a male person who had a female hostage and was holding her with a knife
4910452 police negotiated with the male person and was able to have that lady freed from him but he continued to be agitated and subsequently lunged at police
4910453 the police union is quite happy after initial inquiries the investigation will show that the officers have acted completely correctly at all times whilst protecting their own lives

4910459 ive fictionalized characters obviously and at times compressed events and things like that but theres very little in the book that didnt actually happen
4910460 thats the scary thing my editor kept saying don this is over the top and my response would be i would think so too except it happened which was what was so horrifying about writing the book
4910461 how do you get to that point how does anybody get to that point
4910462 it was the reinvention of the mexican drug industry from a group of local rural drug growers into a cartel that was centralized
4910463 and then realized it could make a lot more money importing cocaine from columbia and moving it than it could by growing the poppy
4910464 it was a very pivotal year it was the law of unintended consequences we thought we were destroying the home ground of heroin importation in the country the real consequences were just metastasizing it just spreading that cancer and forcing it in a way to become better organized and more efficient which it did
4910465 and just have these black cardboard figures and the same with heroes i suppose what i wanted to show was some of the moral and emotional complexity of the war on drugs
4910466 i tried very hard with the characters who are pretty villainous pretty evil really to nevertheless see things through their eyes to see things through their point of view
4910467 and as long as the rules are clear people are more willing to be forthcoming i would simply tell them if they werent im going to write this anyway and i want to include your point of view if you want it included then help me get it right tell me what was on your mind what you were thinking tell me what your take is on it and ill do my best to include it
4910468 that is what the americans cannot seem to understand that all they do is drive up the price and make us rich
4910469 the product for the cartels is never the drug and for any smuggler of anything its not the physical material its the ability to move it across a fictional line a nonexistent line a symbolic line i e a border thats the product the product costs you 36 cents on one side then you step over one foot and it costs 1 75 its the ability to move it across that line thats what the mexicans understood and made huge profits because of it

4910471 a lot of evils been perpetuated based on the claim that we were fighting evil
4910472 i have one clear message for them people will be out there enforcing the law and if the law needs any amendment then we wont hesitate to do so
4910473 like any law once its out there being implemented if we find any need to improve it then well do so its only two weeks old
4910474 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4910475 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4910476 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4910477 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4910478 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4910479 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4910480 do you want to know the good news or the bad news
4910481 the bad news is that all the whites will have to go live in the townships but the good news is that all their stolen tv sets and radios will be there waiting for them
4910482 everyday citizens can just get a box and attach it to a tv we have to think about costs and how we can get access to appropriate stations for the inmates
4910483 it adds to their social adjustment it keeps them in tune with current events theres more going on in their world than whats going on in the prison environment
4910484 what you cant do is sell them thats illegal but you can give them away
4910485 existential intelligence can be defined as the ability to be sensitive to or have the capacity for conceptualizing or tackling deeper or larger questions about human existence such as the meaning of life why are we born why do we die what is consciousness or how did we get here
4910486 ya rasulullah aku tidak melihat engkau berpuasa pada bulan bulan lain seperti engkau berpuasa pada bulan syaban
4910487 bulan itu syaban adalah bulan yang dilupakan oleh manusia yaitu bulan di antara bulan rajab dan ramadhan bulan itu adalah bulan diangkatnya amal amal manusia kepada tuhan semesta alam aku suka amal amalku diangkat sementara aku sedang berpuasa
4910488 dikatakan tentang puasa pada bulan syaban bahwa puasa seseorang pada bulan itu merupakan latihan untuk menjalani puasa ramadhan hal itu agar ia memasuki puasa ramadhan tidak dengan berat dan beban sebaliknya dengan puasa syaban ia telah terlatih dan terbiasa melakukan puasa dengan puasa syaban sebelumnya ia telah menemukan lezat dan nikmatnya berpuasa dengan begitu ia akan memasuki puasa ramadhan dengan kuat giat dan semangat

4910490 whats the worst thing youve been caught by the cops doing on your bike
4910491 dhrider47 i was building snow jumps on the sidewalk haha they really loved that then i was riding on a fountain in the middle of town and a cop with short shorts a terrible police bike helmet and the biggest p o s of a bike started screaming at me telling him i make him look bad in a way i felt bad for him
4910492 pstreethucker building dirt jumps in the middle of a city park and jumping them the the police pulled up so we stopped but they got out and told us to keep jumping them they were bike cops they just wanted to watch
4910493 bikingrules18 in canada we dont get it trouble from police its just like environmentalist retards that tear down everything you build
4910494 cletus44 yeah well most park rangers treat you like like you just slept with their wife or gay husband i once fell on a path dont ask me how and as i lay bleeding a bit on the path a park ranger drives around me and looks pissed because im in his way
4910495 berspitze there is a hill just out of town from my house where they always put one of those speed signs so that if you are speeding it starts flashing so i decided to ride home and get my road bike go back to the hill and go as fast as i could being that there were no cars in any direction i went for it i ended up hitting the 41mph mark in a 25 zone once i saw the speed i decided to slow down but too late there was a unit parked on a little side road he pulled me over and said that i shouldnt be going so fast on my bicycle and that if he ever caught me doing that again he wouldnt be so rational the ticked that he wanted to give if i did it again was reckless endangerment
4910496 the main reason that we wanted to have it is to pull people back together to become united as one again to share the pow wow with them
4910497 this is our time to bring all people together and celebrate by ways of dance and food native and non native
4910498 the vendors come from many states as well as the dancers drummers and everyone to enjoy a wonderful weekend of spiritual renewal and awakenings and the meeting together of many families and friends
4910499 we as the mingo nation were part of the five nations of the iriquois confederacy
4910500 we were originally known as the ohio seneca or sandusky seneca and later known as the mingo
4910501 our purpose of the mingo urb is for the people
4910502 the children are our next generation to come so it is our responsibility to maintain culture and tradition to reestablish language and to make our nation a better world for all generations to come
4910503 our culture is a living experience of spiritual understanding within ourselves by ways of teaching dancing stories and daily living in harmony with everything upon mother earth
4910504 the gathering is our way of bringing everyone together in harmony to express our way of celebrating through the dance circle
4910505 as we dance upon mother earth with the heartbeat of the drums
4910506 we have a beginning and we live and breathe life as we all do until it comes full circle in the end when we become one of the beloved ancestors
4910507 the urb had a couple in kenton a few years ago
4910508 but nothing ongoing the discussion came about to have another one we were kind of appointed
4910509 our regalia has many spiritual and special meanings to all who wear them
4910510 many people have been given them through ancestors and from the first stitch bead feather or skull many prayers and hard work has gone into the finished regalia making it all complete
4910511 the absence of a net is a minor oversight that wont deter us
4910512 i have a fish glove and if necessary a pair of hook cutters
4910513 the last time i did this bats flew from beneath he bridge into my face
4910514 when i tell my friends back home about nights like this spent fishing on a lake they will hardly believe it
4910515 maybe we should find a cabin with lights on and ask
4910516 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4910517 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4910518 i want to go out there for those 40 something year olds and show age is just a number and have fun
4910519 we were expecting them to come out and hit everything being able to execute their strategies and keep us off balance so we wanted to take it to them and be physical with them
4910520 absolutely it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champion this was a big game for us
4910521 i like our defense forcing the number of turnovers that we did
4910522 i think weve been trying to prove that from the first day of practice two months ago
4910523 ron got some pitches up and they hit most of them i hope he just forgets about this one but you never know what a pitcher is thinking if i did id be filthy rich
4910524 if he cant go tuesday the disabled list is a possibility
4910525 tim i tell you a secret that youre not supposed to know yet ok
4910526 the samsung client said that they think your entry was the funniest entry and the entire team there agrees so they want you to win the 32
4910527 no lah dude i dont think we should do that
4910528 i know tim i told them that but they all insist that you win it they thought your entry was the funniest even if it was just done for fun
4910529 look the client picks the winners not you or anyone in nuffnang so if they insist your entry was the best and if you want to take it then whats wrong besides some people are going to say what theyre going to say anyway in the past even when you had done nothing wrong they would make up stories to try to put you down so why should this even stop you
4910530 you cant always be so nice youre going to get stepped all over one day
4910531 i finished second four times and i really learned a lot each time
4910532 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4910533 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4910534 theres no comparison what michael has been doing is amazing
4910535 hes one of those rare guys in that he can win with huge gaps and he can win the close ones hes got incredible drive and he just doesnt get tired
4910536 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out it was the difference im just lost for words
4910537 the schedule was a lot tougher that i thought it was going to be
4910538 it kind of makes the rest of us look like we dont want a gold medal
4910539 i would expect that you are going to see him win by margins and set times that have never been done before and hell be unbelievable
4910540 my goal of raising the bar in the sport of swimming is coming along nicely
4910541 but i think its definitely going to take time for me to get it where i want it to be
4910542 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4910543 he was very good at where to go and through his progressions that was not a problem he was sharp
4910544 the completions the incomplete passes and things you look at the numbers and say he struggled theres reasons for things that happened each play he did misfire on a couple of them he had people in his face in a couple plays he couldnt step up
4910545 what you did tonight was epic and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are
4910546 i never thought for one moment that you were out of that race
4910547 you werent born when i did what i did and im sure i was a part of your inspiration and i take that as a full compliment
4910548 they say that you judge ones character by the company you keep and im certainly happy to keep company with you
4910549 there have been so many greats who have come before me and what mark did is still amazing
4910550 nadie me dio una raz n l gica de por qu no publicar dice astrada sobre lo que le pas con el material de su serie
4910551 el asesinato de una mujer en el marco de relaciones desiguales de poder entre hombres y mujeres
4910552 las ong en guatemala han reaccionado de manera mezclada nuestra reflexi n interna a n no ha terminado cuenta a las12 sebasti n elgueta investigador del equipo centroam rica de amnist a internacional autor del informe ni protecci n ni justicia homicidio de mujeres la ley tiene aspectos positivos y es que pone el t rmino violencia de g nero y le eleva el perfil incluye apoyo integral para sobrevivientes asistencia legal para v ctimas y el compromiso de proveer financiamiento para estas iniciativas pero en t rminos del procedimiento penal la ley anterior era bastante comprensible para asegurar la persecuci n de los responsables de asesinar mujeres nosotros identificamos que casi nadie era llevado delante de la justicia no por falta de un marco legal adecuado sino por una falta de iniciativa por parte de polic as pero m s que todo de fiscales que son quienes investigan estos cr menes y tambi n por una actitud de discriminaci n hacia las instituciones estatales que tienen que ver la ley es una se al positiva pero no es la rectificaci n de esas limitaciones institucionales
4910553 uno de los indicadores de extrema violencia cuyo fin no s lo es causar la muerte sino hacer sufrir a la persona antes de morir
4910554 la mayor a de los cr menes ocurren entre las 6 de la tarde y las 11 de la noche cuando el hombre suele estar en la casa
4910555 1612 casos son consecuencia del consumo de alcohol en 155 son celos y en 26 drogas
4910556 la mayor a de los casos de muerte violenta de mujeres no son investigados en los que s la investigaci n no se realiza de manera eficiente las autoridades no manejan eficientemente la escena del crimen en muchos casos se justifica el no investigar con la estigmatizaci n de las v ctimas culpando a las mujeres por lo sucedido desacredit ndolas especulando su participaci n en una mara pandilla juvenil por tener alg n tatuaje en el cuerpo o calific ndolas de sexo servidoras si llevan las u as pintadas y minifalda
4910557 en guatemala sintieron que estaba hablando mal de su pa s
4910558 llegu al cuerpo de bomberos recuerda ellos tienen un departamento de prensa que se encarga de avisar a los medios cuando aparece alg n cuerpo u ocurri alg n accidente pero claro los bomberos avisaban a los que consideraban m s de su palo as que para tener mejor v nculo con ellos el primer tiempo me quedaba con ellos hablando com amos juntos me qued a dormir ah hasta que me dijeron andate que te avisamos sintieron que no estaba jugando sino que de verdad estaba haciendo un trabajo serio
4910559 el movimiento de mujeres hace un enorme esfuerzo trabaja en condiciones arriesgadas arriesg ndose a que las maten asegura el investigador de amnesty el esfuerzo de las organizaciones locales ha logrado que se incremente el n mero de fiscales dedicados a la investigaci n ha puesto de relieve el tema y hecho que se lo tome en serio
4910560 estos son los primeros pasos a dar antes de esperar resultados concretos
4910561 el turista normal nunca se ve involucrado en cr menes que hacen noticia debido a que los m viles de estos cr menes no suelen ser m s que un robo o atraco
4910562 escaso empe o demostrado en realizar investigaciones a fondo la ausencia de medidas para la protecci n de los testigos las v ctimas y sus familiares y la falta de informaci n y de datos sobre los casos las causas de la violencia y el perfil de las v ctimas
4910563 es duro ver que el violador o el asesino de tu hija est libre y que presentar una denuncia no sirve para nada es incluso peor acusar a los autores es peligroso porque muchas veces te amenazan a ti
4910564 la ocupaci n de la v ctima es un dato que contribuye a dignificar su muerte ya que se comunica cu les fueron sus aportes a la vida social pol tica y cultural de su pa s
4910565 las declaraciones de las personas cercanas a las mujeres asesinadas son claves para reivindicar su vida en raras oportunidades se les da espacio a las familias para reclamar justicia o para que den a conocer el trato que las autoridades le dan a la investigaci n
4910566 abordar el contexto social y pol tico en el que se presentan los casos contribuir a a que la poblaci n tome conciencia de la situaci n que se vive en el pa s la prensa no pone de manifiesto el c rculo vicioso de la violencia de g nero y c mo afect el entorno de la afectada tampoco muestra objetivamente el perfil que retrate la conducta de los victimarios
4910567 los medios monitoreados est n faltando a compromisos asumidos por el estado guatemalteco en el mbito internacional en materia de derechos humanos derechos de las mujeres y promoci n de nuevas formas de comunicaci n y de informaci n esta tendencia informativa genera percepciones exacerbadas sobre la violencia afecta la participaci n social de las guatemaltecas e inhibe su desarrollo

4910571 ampam will consolidate australias best materials processing research by combining scientists and engineers from uq the australian research council centre of excellence for design in light metals the defence materials technology centre and three co operative research centres crcs cast crc crc for advanced composite structures and the polymers crc
4910572 these researchers will help small and medium players in the manufacturing sector to supply larger firms bidding for high value contracts in global industries such as aerospace automotive health and agriculture
4910573 working together scientists engineers and business people will rapidly translate research breakthroughs into practical tools for industry and give queensland and other australian businesses a vital edge over international competitors
4910574 ampam will foster an integrated multi materials approach to research and development
4910575 by combining metals such as titanium magnesium and aluminium with
4910576 innovations in products as different as rocket structures car engines and cardiac stents could emerge from this centre within its first few years
4910577 we showed him a lot more info than any player has ever seen before how we scout how we measure players statistically
4910578 we just talked about the team how we operate and where we are going and then his performance and place in the future so i would say it was a good meeting in that a it happened and b marian had good input observations and understanding
4910579 sometimes you think how it could be in an eastern system in a more offensive system theres more offense there for sure
4910580 he seemed surprised pleasantly to learn he is among the top scorers in the league right now and doesnt need to go anywhere else to do that
4910581 so only his groins have kept him from being right there which would not change with another team
4910582 i bought this i should have the privilege and rights to do what i want to it
4910583 i think nova seafoods the team to beat theyre solid they dont make any mistakes but were here
4910584 we kicked the ball around a little bit but we had solid pitching and some timely hitting
4910585 last game i think we had two hits the whole game we just didnt hit the ball and we werent in it mentally
4910586 we are writing you not as your election strategists but as people of faith whose primary allegiance is to be prophetic witnesses to the ethical vision articulated in the holy texts of our religion and the elaboration of those religious traditions over the course of the past two thousand years
4910587 im ready to contribute im ready to make my mark
4910588 he is a home run threat every time he touches the ball we havent had that since ive been here
4910589 i feel like i have a big heart that makes up for the weight and height i dont have
4910590 i think stephfons got a great career ahead of him he didnt finish up his senior year of high school the way he started it because of a knee injury but i think stephfon will be fine and we think he can be an all purpose back
4910591 we all know that stephfons an exciting back im excited to see him just like everybody else
4910592 weve got so many weapons on offense we have to use them
4910593 were trying to mix it up weve really got the option to do anything we can put in two a backs an a back a tailback and a fullback or we can do a tailback and a flanker
4910594 weve got an offensive line that can open up holes
4910595 we saw that last year they just blow people out of the water
4910596 i pouted last year when they told me they were going to redshirt me
4910597 every game i cried i wanted to be out there
4910598 if evan has the inside game brent carter has both and im more of an outside guy well be fine but i feel like i can run inside the tackles too
4910599 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4910600 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4910601 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4910602 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4910603 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4910604 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4910605 queensland government backing is vital to this three year research program which has grown out of more than two years of high level engagement between the chinese academy of sciences and uq and the queensland government
4910606 look at this we made it down to the river
4910607 guess its the end of the trail wed better get back up there
4910608 everything is a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing christ jesus my lord

4910612 i am an american fighting man i serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life i am prepared to give my life in their defense
4910613 i will never surrender of my own free will if in command i will never surrender my men while they still have the means to resist

4910617 i will never forget that i am an american fighting man responsible for my actions and dedicated to the principles which made my country free i will trust in my god and in the
4910618 optimal performance comes from me setting the framework and parameters and allowing them to take ownership and lead
4910619 ill give you the instruction ill lead you from the standpoint of heres what it is heres what were going to do and there has to be a trust involved as well
4910620 that they are going to give you what they want what they need and that youre not going to grind them into pulp and that theyre going to in turn make it internal it isnt going to be a deal where ive got to beat 30 guys over the head with a baseball bat
4910621 as long as everybody is playing by the same rules 80 is 80 and it is a finite number
4910622 its like there hasnt been any hitting or there hasnt been any balls on the ground here or that nobody has been subjected to any conditioning or football like movements
4910623 thats just not accurate to even insinuate the fumbles are because we havent tackled to the ground those guys get whacked in that inside drill and we have had live goal line short yardage drills
4910624 putting the pants on most of the time when you have those on theres only going to be a couple of times that you tackle to the ground

4910629 there are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils one is to disbelieve in their existence the other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them they themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight

4910640 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4910641 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4910642 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4910643 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4910644 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4910645 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4910646 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4910647 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4910648 design tools fear and loathing in the newspaper business somewhere and adobe incopy too
4910649 oh yes and youll make how much money this year and cant you clean house by cleaning instead of to continue this analogy buidling a new house next door and wrecking the first one

4910651 people never recall the bicycle but who taught them to ride it they dont recall the basketball game but who taught them to play it they dont recall the english class but who taught the lesson
4910652 should i not inform you of that which i fear for you even more than the dangers of dajjal it is the hidden shirk a person stands to pray and he beautifies his prayer because he sees the people looking at him
4910653 islam is built upon five pillars testifying that there is no true god except allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah performing the prayers paying the zakat making the pilgrimage to the house and fasting the month of ramadhan
4910654 allah will not look at a person with pleasure who commits sodomy with a man or a woman
4910655 if someone is ordered to take an oath and he takes a false oath in order to take possession of property of a muslim then he will incur allahs wreath when he meets him
4910656 do you know who the bankrupt is the bankrupt form my nation is the one who appears on the day of resurrection having performed the prayers fasted and paid the zakat but had also abused that person slandered that person wrongfully taken the wealth of that person and spilled the blood of that person these people will take from his good deeds if his good deeds are thereby exhausted he will be given their sins and then he will be thrown into the hell fire
4910657 allahs curse is upon women who appear like men and upon men who appear like women
4910658 allah has forbidden the paradise to three people the alcoholic the runaway slave and the one who is complacent in the face of the evil deeds that his family is performing
4910659 these two are being punished and they are not being punished for something hard but it is a great sin one of them did not keep himself clean form his urine and the other went around spreading tales
4910660 if allah were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and earths then he would punish and he would not be doing injustice to them if he were to have mercy on them his mercy would be greater than from their actions if a person had amount of gold equivalent to mount uhud or similar to mount uhud and spent it in the path of allah that spending would not be accepted form him by allah until he believes in the preordainment of good and evil and until he knows that what afflicted him was not going to miss him and what missed him was not going to afflict him if you were to die with any belief other than that you would enter the hellfire
4910661 abusing a muslim is evil and fighting him is disbelief
4910662 whoever goes to fortune teller and asks him about something will not have his prayer accepted for forty nights
4910663 the people who will receive the greatest punishment on the day of judgment are those who compete with allah in creation those who make pictures or statues
4910664 one who strikes his cheeks or tears his clothing and shouts in the manner of pre islamic culture is not one of us
4910665 allah will torture those who torture people in this world
4910666 a person whose neighbour is not safe from his mischief will not enter paradise
4910667 what is below the ankles will be in the hellfire note this is a general hadith which applies irrespective of whether pride is involved or not and is not limited to prayers
4910668 whoever shows enmity to a slave of mine allahs i shall be at war with him
4910669 gold and silk have been permitted for the females of my nation and forbidden for its males
4910670 men who wears silk in this world will have no portion of heavens in the hereafter
4910671 if a slave runs away his prayers will not be accepted
4910672 the one who sacrifices for other than allah is cursed by allah
4910673 one who claims that someone is his father and knows that it is not true will be forbidden of paradise
4910674 whoever argues in support of something that is wrong and he knows it allah will be angry with him until he stops
4910675 whoever doesnt allow the access water or pasture for others will not share in the blessings of allah on the day of judgment
4910676 whoever hears the call to prayer and doesnt come to prayer there is no prayer for him say for the one who has valid excuse
4910677 if people dont stop abandoning the friday prayers allah may seal their hearts and they will become headless
4910678 hey britt ever since we met my life has been different and the nights we cuddled or the time we spent talkin or seeing you after work just made me realize that i want that all the time i want that just for me so lets make us official
4910679 management defended chief bolton during his dispute with the fbi over the allocation of resources
4910680 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4910681 when we get to 18 months then well be well on our way
4910682 had the acting ability to take the audience with him on his personal and physical journey
4910683 epic romantic and really about what it is to be a human being it affected and still affects me hugely and i hope it will do the same to audiences atonement also explores the truth of how we are at our best when we are being attacked and robbie turner is forced to fight on two fronts
4910684 id first seen james in a play about seven years ago and i could tell how good he was id offered him parts twice before and this third time was the charm james has working class roots and that was very important robbies story is that of a working class boy whose life is often at the mercy of the snobbery of an upper class family james also has a deep soul and isnt afraid to show it the character is described by ian mcewan as having eyes of optimism and james has those when he smiles you smile when he cries you cry
4910685 later in the story it is written that there is a stamp of experience in the corners of his eyes through james performance you feel the pathos
4910686 joe would tell me dont beg them to cry meaning the audience
4910687 as a director joe knows how to choreograph his scenes understands the story hes telling respects his crew and loves actors he made me a better actor on atonement
4910688 the sequence was originally scripted as a montage but that would have required 30 40 set ups in a single day with consistent light so we went a different route
4910689 we wanted something that would evolve within the scene itself and was appropriate for the context the conventional way to shoot what robbie is seeing would be to go for a wide shot with a longer lens with this shot you are with robbie so you share his point of view and also see his face his reaction to it all
4910690 joe wanted the scale to be fully conveyed to me this shot says everything about dunkirk and about robbies journey
4910691 my father was in or attached to the british army for 50 years he was on the beach at dunkirk severely wounded and then evacuated when he talked about it you could see the darkness of the memory yet also the sense that it was when he felt most fully alive
4910692 we talked to one veteran who couldnt tell us a lot he said when youre doing it boys just think about how bad it really was it was hard for him to even say that to us
4910693 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4910694 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4910695 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4910696 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4910697 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4910698 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs
4910699 i can never quite tell if the defeatists are conservative satirists poking fun at the left or simply retards or both retarded satire perhaps

4910702 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way
4910703 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
4910704 we will begin the demolition process in accordance with the courts approval
4910705 well take every legal remedy available to us to stop them from trespassing on village property
4910706 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs
4910707 i can never quite tell if the defeatists are conservative satirists poking fun at the left or simply retards or both retarded satire perhaps
4910708 you two the rev and el comandante make an erudite pair i guess it beats thinking
4910709 as a comedian as a person as a citizen as a mammal everyman is susceptible to utter bullshit the redeeming factor of things like blogs from all sides and the daily show is that at some level they indicate an unwillingness of a segment of the population to go along with bullshit my boss and i started in on a political slant yesterday and i threw up my hands and said
4910710 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
4910711 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about
4910712 the absurdity of what you imagine to be the dark heart of conspiracy theorists wet dreams far too frequently turns out to be true
4910713 you go i know what ill do ill create a character who when hiring people to rebuild the nation we invaded says the only question ill ask is what do you think of roe v wade itll be hilarious then you read that book about the green zone in iraq
4910714 and you go oh they did that i mean how do you take things to the next level
4910715 man id take a mistress ya know nothing tied down no commitment yeah a mistress is the way to go
4910716 well i think i would have to say id prefer a wife id like to start a family and build on that foundation

4910720 he was a nice clean cut american boy ive known the powers family for years and theyre the kind of family thats always giving back to the community
4910721 despite the weather and the economy we are doing fairly well all things considered

4910723 you cant get caught up on how a teams going good or bad
4910724 sure they were swinging the bats good against texas i look at quality pitches i try to avoid whos hot and whos not
4910725 i dont think hes too worried about whos at the plate
4910726 he can pause a game plan and work against hitters he pumps strikes and makes it easier for guys behind him its impressive to watch
4910727 he throws strikes hes got great stuff and its tough to get into a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going
4910728 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
4910729 hes been doing that for years when he stays healthy
4910730 the legislature has already deemed it to be within the public interest
4910731 why not just have all the questions asked and answered and move forward
4910732 whats the bearable amount that we think is acceptable until we say that this resource isnt going to produce power cleanly enough or the price is too high
4910733 electric customers are entitled to safe and reliable service at the lowest possible cost
4910734 i think we all knew at the outset that putting this scrubber unit up was not going to be cheap but the rewards and benefits on the other side i think are going to be substantial
4910735 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4910736 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4910737 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4910738 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4910739 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4910740 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4910741 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4910742 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4910743 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4910744 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4910745 i have been on both sides of it everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4910746 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4910747 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4910748 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4910749 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4910750 its a nice safe utility but it has to be clean it cant have 3 2 billion in debt on it
4910751 i think they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they let everybody know that they are for real
4910752 they are playing with a purpose and that purpose is to win and show everybody else they are superior thats the bottom line
4910753 i was asked where has my offense went it aint go nowhere
4910754 its the same shots i was taking in the last couple games they just went in that comes from putting in extra work in practice before practice getting in a little better shape im going to continue doing that until the tournament is over
4910755 were not going to let up were trying to get ready and win a gold medal no matter how well we play
4910756 each game we dont know if were going to be tested or not we came into the greece game thought we were going to be tested spain game though we were going to be tested
4910757 if at the end of the tournament thats where we are well take that

4910784 if it were the regular season it would not have been a big deal but we wanted to be careful
4910785 this is the first hand removal of a dam anywhere in the state
4910786 the trend is definitely going to increase dams like this are now just liabilities to their owners removing them creates short term impacts the water gets muddy and material sediment is transported downstream but the long term benefits far far outweigh drawbacks
4910787 one of the reasons this project was vital is with the dams if wed had a catastrophic event there was no way for fish to move upstream now they can that gives us a sense of relief
4910788 we should be able to tell relatively soon if fish are passing through the system
4910789 we could take our best guess and try to force it back to the channel we think is right
4910790 but the best thing we can do for this stream is let it run its course
4910791 i dont even recognize it from when we first got here

4910797 while many other states provide general funds for their wildlife agencies in pennsylvania state taxpayers do not contribute to the commission only our hunters and trappers

4910854 they deferred a lot because he was the big dog
4910855 it makes it a little more difficult this season hopefully we can find ways to make all of them happy
4910856 theres no such thing as one back anymore in the nfl or in college
4910857 i have no problem with a two to three back system because it gives you weapons to throw at a defense and it makes it easier
4910858 we probably went too far too fast with him and slowed down his comfort level in the games
4910859 once he got settled in you saw what he could do
4910860 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4910861 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4910862 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4910863 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4910864 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4910865 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4910866 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4910867 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world no way we were going to let those guys down

4910869 every single athlete in the world right now needs to tip their hat to michael phelps
4910870 it wouldnt have been possible without the help of my teammates
4910871 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4910872 everything had to go perfect everything had to fall perfectly into place and i was able to have probably the best week of my life
4910873 to the factual gaps that give history its tantalizing air of the unknown
4910874 five years have passed since the united states led a military invasion into iraq and george bush declared a mission accomplished but americas proposed goals remain elusive iraqs fragile stability hinges on deals brokered with sunnis and shiites iraqis caught in the midst of open ended war struggle to survive
4910875 i keep asking myself what justifies the enormous costs of this war and the wounds it has inflicted i am at a loss for an answer this is the story of war
4910876 i dont mind if you did that i just dont like the lifestyle of those addicts on the strip
4910877 yay lets go for it the most important thing to me is that i have a great trip this is gonna work out perfect
4910878 she came in the same day rocsi went out and he had already issued the statement that they were separated
4910879 the sub story is that he has been under investigation because 57 million dollars is missing from our government they froze all of his bank accounts hes getting a separation because he cant afford to get a divorce
4910880 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at
4910881 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4910882 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated last night wednesday august 13 2008 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its enquiries whilst it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me i continue to have the utmost respect for the people of the tci who have always shown me kindness and support i vow to continue my work amongst the people of turks and caicos islands until recently i had hoped that i would be able to continue to assist my husband during what will undoubtedly be difficult times ahead for him i do not wish to have to add to his difficulties
4910883 i was just as shocked about hearing about it as anyone and everyone else but just as any wifes position would be in such an allegation as this it has to put a damper on the marriage
4910884 by him going overseas and talking with the israeli government and the people who mean the most to the united states i think what hes doing is great
4910885 what hes showing now is that he has the experience to go out and reach out to these people and to say to them hey this is barack obama
4910886 the ontological aspects of subjectivity are produced in different or rather antagonistic ways
4910887 the spectacle destroys any collective form of sociality individualizing social actors in their separate automobiles and in front of separate video screens and at the same time imposes a new mass sociality a new uniformity of action and thought
4910888 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
4910889 hollywood must share the blame for the obesity epidemic every day we see examples of overeating gorging food play and general disregard for health in movies and tv shows no wonder millions of people are overweight

4910899 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4910900 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
4910901 i think in terms of just sheer dominance in his events
4910902 and the times hes putting up and what hes done now over two olympics really three but the two where hes won medals i think its hard to argue of course im a swimming coach

4910941 with 55 kilometres to go it was just pete and one other rider with him i thought this is too far to go to be down to two
4910942 with 40 kilometres left pete was on his own and he had a minute he just rode away without really going too hard behind them there was a bit of a regrouping with two aussies including simon clarke and a russian
4910943 i told pete dont sit up and wait for them but dont bury yourself either because they were going to catch him anyway and it was better to have some company
4910944 clarkey kept trying but pete just went and went again and got clear to win

4910957 if the students are studying edgar allen poe for example the teacher can bring video streaming on him right into the classroom
4910958 we have to change the way we teach because students have changed the way they learn you cant stand in front of a group of students anymore and lecture it doesnt work
4910959 youre looking at a future of not even having textbooks having everything online
4910960 we will come up with an implementation plan with the superintendent and technology department
4910961 the superintendent and the board have been great in showing their support for these grants

4911004 the catch is to make them see that it affects them
4911005 but lately there is a heightened concern they see the melting of the polar icecaps and the polar bears disappearing

4911033 the attendance is proof that people are really coming out
4911034 ive worked for cranberry for eight years and this is how we have accomplished most of our projects
4911035 thats been the key to our success story and it doesnt surprise me at all
4911036 i think people will like the way its laid out
4911037 we need this system to streamline access to water data and models and to enable more effective water resource management it will give us the knowledge management and ict infrastructure to manage appropriately the new multi billion dollar water infrastructure underway in south east queensland and elsewhere
4911038 the clear goal of this research is sustainable healthy waterways and healthy ecosystems
4911039 it will be valuable for conservation industry and community organisations as well as researchers and educators
4911040 the initial advantages will be for south east queensland but subsequently other regions in australia and internationally will have access to customised services resulting from this project
4911041 it will be a significant advance on our current information systems as it will be designed so that good information underpins the management investments by healthy waterways partners
4911042 one of our priorities is to establish strong links with universities across the asia pacific region whereby we can combine the strengths of our research capabilities and resources with those of outstanding universities like uq
4911043 professor hunters water management research has the potential to benefit not only australia but countries throughout the region that through the increasing pressures of population growth urbanisation and climate change would benefit from more sophisticated approaches to water management

4911049 we didnt stop them and a lot of that came from jackson scrambling
4911050 i went in a little earlier than i expected and felt pretty comfortable
4911051 when you go in with those guys you just have to step up
4911052 they are required to demonstrate to the department that they have planned for the most effective technologies for removing hazardous pollutants from the emissions
4911053 we are continually looking for ways to tweak our system to better our controls but the technology in my opinion will stay the same
4911054 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4911055 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4911056 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4911057 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4911058 people have less time so their garden projects have changed over time convenience time saving factors less mess
4911059 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4911060 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4911061 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
4911062 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
4911063 there were a lot of things to appreciate in the performance tonight in that we didnt just pack it in and say lets go home
4911064 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
4911065 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
4911066 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
4911067 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
4911068 i dont have one yet but i think ill build one just for that
4911069 its hard to fathom when someone beats you by one one hundredth
4911070 am i crazy for wondering if the geeks at penndot are crazy or are all these construction projects their idea of fun specifically im referring to the fact that all three mainline roads have work going on at the same time parkway east parkway west and parkway north
4911071 you cant say that pennbotch doesnt have a sense of humor specifically the lane closure on route 30 near greensburg coinciding with the opening of steelers training camp at st vincent college
4911072 last weekend there were construction delays on the parkway west in robinson which were noted ahead of time what i was not prepared for was an additional inbound traffic jam at carnegie where two workers doing some patch work had traffic backed up in single file for a mile was this scheduled and publicized
4911073 it took us 45 minutes to get from robinson to the i 79 interchange and i noted a lot of cars were exiting on i 79 south to avoid heavy one lane traffic we didnt know what was causing the delay nor where the issue was without some idea of the location of the issue and impact i was unable to make an informed decision
4911074 this is a large construction season and it can be difficult to encapsulate everything we are doing in the media
4911075 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store
4911076 this is going to be the model of all of our stores
4911077 that kept me coming back because it was more fun
4911078 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much
4911079 this is a serial rapist and vicious murderer who tore apart countless lives during his crime spree
4911080 this is why zoning codes were implemented in the first place to protect property values and public welfare
4911081 nobody wants to take the bull by the horns and do whats right
4911082 why have hearings when you arent going to do a thing about this
4911083 she was unique she was in the forefront of women in jewish education at that time
4911084 she was very intense and she was very dedicated to her students
4911085 she tried to bring out in her students the best they could offer
4911086 she really loved her occupation and dedicated her life to that
4911087 ninety nine percent of the people i encountered were kind some bent over backwards to help me out
4911088 ive been a big fan of vincent van gogh since high school lots of his works are based on optical blending techniques
4911089 i also like to experiment with different historical techniques and mix them in my works

4911105 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4911106 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4911107 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4911108 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4911109 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4911110 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4911111 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4911112 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4911113 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4911114 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4911115 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4911116 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4911117 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4911118 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4911119 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4911120 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4911121 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4911122 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4911123 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4911124 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4911125 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4911126 a lot of the families on the north side are related to each other but over a period of years the kids got disconnected
4911127 were trying to introduce the little ones to each other then by the time they are 12 or 13 theyll know each other as friends
4911128 we got to get all these kids back in sync with each other
4911129 we have to get our young people back in church instead of trying to make fast money by killing each other
4911130 we just need to keep working on that and realize that weve won a preseason game its good in some ways but in others it doesnt mean anything
4911131 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4911132 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4911133 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4911134 were not going to make every play but there were plays we left out on the field
4911135 when i have mike walker running down pretty much wide open i know he kind of got jammed at the line but i still have to make that a catchable ball for him you dont want to miss your layups

4911175 the average increase in the prices of various building materials last month varied sharply from 3 to 53 per cent yet the fact remains that the overall prices have increased substantially during the first half of the year
4911176 one of the reasons is the overwhelming demand in abu dhabi where the value of development projects from 2004 to 2007 stood at dh880 billion with dh200 billion additional projects expected this year alone
4911177 nevertheless the steel consumption pattern in the capital suggests the continuation of the imbalance for years to come given that the average annual growth of consumption stood at 24 6 per cent during the past three years it rose from 1 69 million tonnes in 2006 to 2 11 million tonnes in 2007
4911178 only 5 7 per cent of the imports come through abu dhabis ports while the majority comes through dubai
4911179 aims to stop officials from abusing the countrys economic capabilities and to implement international standards to protect and guarantee investors rights
4911180 the probes include several real estate and financial companies not just one company
4911181 the campaigns findings revealed how a number of low ranking employees who come from many nationalities abuse the powers given to them in sales operations to make big money using illegal methods such as bribes and commissions
4911182 the dubai leadership directives have been very clear in taking maximum measures against those involved in such actions since it hurts the country and people
4911183 international companies always look for places that are known for their transparency
4911184 revealing those who may have been involved in corruption bringing them to justice and punishing them once they are convicted will consolidate the uaes reputation as a nation that is transparent and just
4911185 such a crackdown will add to the peace of mind of investors and international companies the uaes reputation is the real issue and such corrupt people will have a negative impact on the countrys status globally
4911186 there are challenges that our company and our industry are facing which are new to us all
4911187 my fear is that the entire economy is broken particularly at the national level but its affecting us in the carolinas too
4911188 were seeing a more significant impact on commercial loan quality and local real estate values than id originally hoped wed see
4911189 its going to take a few years to fix it
4911190 that means lots of stress on community banks poor growth prospects and a lot fewer banking jobs here
4911191 we have seen no indication of any bank based in north carolina facing any situation that would lead them to default
4911192 majority of credit worthy borrowers will find no shortage of loans for traditional mortgage products such as fixed rate loans
4911193 but they will be expected to meet credit standards that some lenders have de emphasized in recent years
4911194 as a direct result of the ongoing crisis in the housing and financial industries
4911195 one large residential construction and development relationship of 4 5 million
4911196 this situation came up fairly quickly within the last six months with a client that weve been doing business with 20 plus years
4911197 they took out a considerable amount of loans not just with us to buy a lot of land in recent years at what they thought was a good price
4911198 when the slowdown hit they had little maneuvering room left
4911199 the reality is were really in challenging times in terms of the economy the markets in housing and financial services
4911200 lots of good progress has been made in working through difficult issues
4911201 the odds are high there will be new challenges and additional issues that well have to face
4911202 were largely driven by continued challenges in residential real estate markets with the largest concentration of credit issues occurring in georgia florida and metro washington
4911203 unfortunately like many community banks were a reflection of the economy were in right now and banks are in disfavor with the investment community
4911204 this approach has led to early identification of potential problem assets and as a result we have increased the allowance for loan losses commensurately to recognize the loss potential in our loan portfolio
4911205 in the majority of these cases these real estate loans were good loans when they were written
4911206 they became negative loans because good home builders are having a rough time in the economic slowdown
4911207 theres no question that we had too much residential expansion from 2002 to 2006 with mortgages being given to homeowners who didnt have the financial resources to maintain the loan when their adjustable rate mortgage rose
4911208 the local housing market is paying the price for that lending binge thats likely to carry into 2010 and likely lead to more home builders going out of business as we work our way back to a normal housing market
4911209 we must stay the course and continue our focus on credit quality as we resolve our problem loans
4911210 we are taking a number of steps to prepare the company to emerge from this economic downturn in a strong competitive position
4911211 with everything that has gone on more borrowers eyes are open to which options are realistic for buying a home and which options are just too risky
4911212 were just in an overly tight housing market now and it obviously hasnt helped consumer confidence with gas and heating oil prices over 4 a gallon at one time he said
4911213 with great economic potential with fedex cargo hub and mack trucks coming up
4911214 sometimes its just a matter of the economic times getting ahold of you he said
4911215 some of the local developers are not getting the revenue from their developments they needed to
4911216 i hope its idiosyncratic one or two loans rather than systemic a slowing economy that diminishes overall credit quality
4911217 it is a lot easier to fix a few problem loans than it is to fix the entire economy
4911218 pandora says theyre alread paying 70 of their 25 million in yearly revenues in royalty fees and it is driving them out of business
4911219 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
4911220 lose our lives and take up the cross and follow him
4911221 but the one who looks into the perfect law the christ is the lamb slain before the foundation of the law of liberty and perserveres being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts he will be blessed in his doing
4911222 blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked nor stands in the way of the sinners nor sits in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the lord and on his law he meditates day and night
4911223 and if you faithfully obey the voice of the lord your god being careful to do all his commandments that i command you today the lord your god will set you high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you if you obey the voice of the lord your god
4911224 only be strong and very courageous being careful to do according to all the law that moses my servant commanded you do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left that you may have good success wherever you go this book of the law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be frightened and do not be dismayed for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
4911225 do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them for truly i say to you until heaven and earth pass away not one iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
4911226 abide in my love if you keep my commandments you will abide in my love just as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love this is my commandment that you love one another as i have love you greater love has no one that this that someone lays down his life for his friends you are my friends if you do what i command you
4911227 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am of the flesh sold under sin
4911228 for the law of the spirit of life has set you free in christ jesus from the law of sin and death for god has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit to set your mind on the flesh is death but to set your mind on the spirit is life and peace for the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god for it does not submit to gods law indeed it cannot those who are in the flesh cannot please god you however are not in the flesh but in the spirit
4911229 therefore be imitators of god as beloved children and walk in love as christ loved us and gave himself up for us a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god
4911230 have this mind among yourselves which is yours in christ jesus who though he was in the form of god did not count equality with god a thing to be grasped but made himself nothing taking on the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on the cross
4911231 for this covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares the lord i will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people
4911232 and you solomon my son know the god of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind for the lord searches all hearts and understands every thought and plan
4911233 i have this against you that you have abandoned the love you had at first remeber therefore from where you have fallen repent and do the works you did at first
4911234 kill steal and destroy but christ has come to give us life and life more abundantly

4911271 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4911272 were going after people who are persuadable people who may be likely obama supporters sporadic voters undecideds
4911273 we persuade we mobilize and we register thats what we do
4911274 when you get to the big four year presidential election the old patterns kick in
4911275 but it was clear what warner was doing and he held down votes which would have automatically gone to republicans can obama do that i dont know
4911276 the military vote is the most fascinating aspect of this thing
4911277 there is an enormous amount of ambivalence about iraq among people there they feel abused jacked around they never know when a loved one is coming home or not thats going to be a factor and mccain may suffer as a result
4911278 john mccain is loved by the military in this state
4911279 he understands the way we think obama is not going to win in virginia because he hasnt done anything he has no experience
4911280 but thats because we havent put the obama signs up yet
4911281 were sick of being jerked around by the oligarchs cartels and dictatorships
4911282 are like going back to the carter era all it did was make us more dependent on foreign oil
4911283 obviously sen obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4911284 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4911285 its really remarkable how extremely popular mr mark warner is
4911286 both mr obama and mr warner are going to washington to change it
4911287 that we intend to fight for every vote were fighting everywhere
4911288 obama can carry virginia but it wont be the state that puts him over the top
4911289 other larger national forces will have to be in play for obama to win virginia wont do it for him
4911290 he is a cultural candidate hes a harvard guy not a down and dirty guy hell take the college towns the african americans the urban affluents but he wont take harry hunter he cant even bowl
4911291 a month ago i would have said im voting for obama but now im not sure
4911292 i voted for bush twice and im disappointed he doesnt seem to be engaged

4911301 quiero hacer referencia a dos conceptos que se trabajaron ac esta ma ana y me parece que son importantes el primero es la idea de proceso y el segundo la idea de las cosas simples que dec a luc a la idea de proceso que la entienden los docentes y quienes tenemos formaci n jur dica tambi n tenemos que leerla mucho y nos acord bamos que es una serie de gradual y concatenada de actos unos sucesivos a los otros siempre en busca de un resultado final esa idea del proceso es cierto est en la educaci n y por sobre todo est en la escuela en esta escuela la 832 que arranc su accionar con problemas simples fueron obteniendo un par de aulas nuevas y alquilando otras y hoy inaugurando la casi totalidad de sus instalaciones decimos la casi totalidad porque siempre es bueno que se sue e y que se anhele m s esta escuela necesita un zoom y lo vamos a estudiar y esta escuela necesita algo m s y ac s quiero detenerme en lo que es el verdadero proceso de la educaci n necesita continuar la formaci n de los chicos
4911302 quiz s el punto m s importante que tiene la educaci n p blica en la argentina es casualmente la escuela media la escuela secundaria yo no tengo la posibilidad de decirle que esto va a ser habilitado porque me gusta obrar con mucha responsabilidad pero tengan la certeza de que a partir de hoy el ministro de educaci n con el intendente municipal y con las distintas directoras lo van a analizar y si hay prioridad este proceso va a continuar porque es nuestra decisi n continuar abriendo escuelas de nivel medio
4911303 all tenemos nuestro mayor desaf o a nuestro modo de entender en la provincia de misiones hay zonas en las que de cada diez chicos que entran en la escuela primaria s lo uno sale de la escuela secundaria seguramente no ser el caso de leandro n ale porque me dec a tambi n el ministro que la realidades en educaci n dependen mucho de las zonas y hay zonas donde tenemos m s calidad educativa hay zonas donde tenemos mejor infraestructura y hay zonas donde tenemos por razones econ micas y sociales mayor inclusi n en la escuela secundaria esto es importante decirlo habiendo muchos intendentes para que cada intendente tambi n adopte el compromiso de saber en cada pueblo cu les son los niveles de educaci n y de inclusi n que tenemos vamos a trabajar en una de las materias pendientes que tenemos en educaci n que es armar lo que se denomina en gerenciamiento y administraci n un gran tablero de comando con los indicadores que nos permitan tener la informaci n exacta de lo que ocurre en los pueblos y en la provincia en t rminos de educaci n
4911304 en estos tiempos en los que se discute tanto lo del indec si la inflaci n es una o es la otra nosotros en misiones no discutimos eso tenemos clara una pol tica los n meros son los que son referidos a salud a seguridad a la educaci n a crecimiento a recaudaci n son los que son porque solamente vamos a poder gobernar bien y tomar las mejores decisiones si sabemos d nde estamos parados y justamente para eso nos sirven los n meros los datos las estad sticas
4911305 en este gobierno buscamos resolver muchas cosas desde lo simple desde lo pr ctico d as pasados viene una se ora de mi pueblo arist bulo del valle y le dice a mi hermana qu bien est gobernando tu hermano
4911306 para que uno pueda continuar con esto los caminos pol ticos no se deben detener deben continuar y deben profundizarse los modelos de provincia deben continuar y deben profundizarse desde la renovaci n con aciertos y con errores con muchas cosas hechas y con muchas cosas pendientes tenemos un camino trazado y estamos en ese proceso en el proceso de una misiones que tenga m s educaci n m s salud m s trabajo m s producci n lo hacemos con muchas ganas con mucha fuerza con mucho cari o con mucha transparencia y sabiendo que siempre nos van a quedar cosas pendientes cada vez que uno llega a un pueblo las demandas de obras nuevas de escuelas son infinitas pero con la tolerancia que han tenido los amigos las amigas que componen esta familia de la 832 vamos a ir cumpliendo este sue o y sue os en todos los lugares de la provincia
4911307 la directora reci n me dec a somos as porque el equipo de docentes que tengo es magn fico cuando alguien conduce a un equipo y ese equipo trabaja en conjunto existe el esfuerzo compartido y el liderazgo reconocido y se alcanzan estos objetivos a esta comunidad educativa hay que sumar a los padres y a la comunidad esta l gica del esfuerzo compartido es lo que debemos hacer crecer en cada pueblo y en cada rea de gobierno por eso para m es importante haber cumplido con un subsidio a nuestras amigas de lalcec que est cumpliendo la primera etapa de su sue o que es una obra civil que seguramente la vamos a inaugurar para luego ah dar el segundo paso que es la compra de un elemento que las ayude a combatir contra una enfermedad muy dif cil como es el c ncer ellas sue an con un mam grafo y el ministro sabe de esa idea y hay otras organizaciones en otros lugares de la provincia que tambi n hacen ese esfuerzo y tambi n tienen sus sue os nuestra visi n es que el esfuerzo debe ser compartido y en buena hora que haya grupos intermedios que colaboren con nosotros en la atenci n de la salud
4911308 siempre dijimos que en este proyecto pol tico y en este modelo de provincia no distinguimos entre salud p blica y salud privada la salud es una sola la de todos los misioneros hay actores p blicos y actores privados y en buena hora que exista este tipo de actores como lalcec de alem y otros grupos intermedios que se preocupan por colaborar y hacerse cargo de parte de las necesidades de nuestra comunidad en el rea de salud asumo desde el gobierno provincial el compromiso para completar la segunda parte que es la compra del mam grafo porque es lo mejor para esta regi n pero pido el compromiso compartido s que este pueblo tiene de la municipalidad de las empresas de las cooperativas porque entre todos tenemos que colaborar para alcanzar estos objetivos descuento se or intendente que nos va a ayudar a alcanzar este sue o
4911309 hemos entregado un subsidio que es emblem tico para una cooperativa de loreto que es un pueblo muy peque o y esta idea de hacer una f brica de alpargatas que es algo sencillo va a generar trabajo y va a devolver vida a un peque o pueblo de la provincia de misiones el subsidio grande de 200 000 pesos es para fericoop para la organizaci n que queremos hacer para el 2 de octubre cuando estaremos para esta feria de cooperativas en el rea de alimentos ustedes saben lo importante que es para nosotros que las cooperativas est n fuertes y se mantengan bien y que nos ayuden y nos acompa en en este desaf o de la producci n de alimentos
4911310 me dec a el intendente la necesidad de vincular a leandro n alem con la ruta 14 cuando se termine la avenida san mart n y yo le digo se or intendente que est absolutamente decidido que llamaremos a licitaci n adjudicaremos y leandro n alem tendr esa arteria terminada
4911311 ive seen them at their worst and now see them at their best thats what we like
4911312 weve all had roots weve left them this is our new roots we call this home this is our team
4911313 we always lean back to that if they make a mistake its the old rays except its not the old rays the new rays come back all redone reborn again ready to win theyre going to win tonight you watch and see
4911314 everybody is a great fan in their own right you dont have to stand here screaming like a nut like i do all you have to do is come and support them then youre a great fan
4911315 saakashvili stressed that next time we also peacefully as it was two years ago shall be directed to abkhazia to liberate sukhumi returning of abkhazia and abkhazians is the main goal of georgia we shall necessarily spread a wave of freedom and democracy to other georgian parts including abkhazia and south ossetia saakashvili stated
4911316 he will be formally arrested and interrogated and the fully story will then be out
4911317 used to inspire terror activities in april he had held a big meeting he had also visited ahmedabad by interrogating him more clues about other blasts that occurred in the country earlier could come out we have uncovered sleeper cells successfully
4911318 in no previous blasts has the case been completely solved these arrests may give leads to other blasts including those in jaipur hyderabad and uttar pradesh
4911319 with a sense of pride i can say that our efforts in the past 20 days have paid off and we have almost completely solved the blasts case
4911320 we have uncovered this network and it will help in solving the cases of other offensives across the country
4911321 the people involved in the blasts were also involved in the surat conspiracy
4911322 there were two different types of bombs used in ahmedabad and surat the integrated chips used in surat didnt go off due to some technical glitch
4911323 the arrest was a setback for the simi activists in gujarat there was a major meeting held in april after nagoris arrest
4911324 we have some hints which will help us in cracking the cases related to the jaipur and mumbai blasts but media needs to bear with us we have all the information about how the blasts were planned but cant be revealed right now
4911325 we received cooperation from up karnataka maharashtra police and also from central agencies the credit of cracking this case goes to the entire indian police force because the entire nations police has helped gujarat police in investigating this case
4911326 its something we have been working towards for four or five years now he said
4911327 we said we were going to give these guys a shake and we certainly did he said
4911328 there are good things to come for us four we are four young guys they have jason lezak and aaron peirsolwho are a bit older
4911329 fundamental selfishness at times also mentioning his experimental use of drugs in the past
4911330 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me obama said
4911331 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage mccain said
4911332 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4911333 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade obama said
4911334 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies

4911337 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4911338 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species

4911343 just a few more throws but i got looser quicker
4911344 i think it is the time of year where everyone is getting tired
4911345 im starting to feel it a little bit but you have to dig deep i dont think it has affected me at the plate at all though
4911346 obviously he has never caught this many games at this level him and i talk about it there is some mental frame that he has to be in but i think what he did last winter and what he has done this season about his conditioning has really helped him it is a grind it is a lot of baseball
4911347 right now for example i think our guys are trying to do a little bit too much because we are not scoring
4911348 you try to do a little too much and it will take you out of your approach but obviously word has also gotten out that nate mclouth and ryan are very good hitters so that has been a factor too
4911349 i think it is no secret everyone in our clubhouse loves it when he plays because he brings so much energy but he understands the situation we are giving some guys opportunities to develop their career
4911350 honestly the biggest adjustment i see for pedro is just playing everyday the physical the mental parts of that
4911351 pedros already swung a wooden bat in summer leagues so i dont think that will be a problem
4911352 some would argue hes got a ital better end ital swing with wood amateur hitters get away with a lot with alumimum because the sweet spot of the bat is a lot longer with wood you have to have a more refined swing you have to center the ball pedro gets rewarded more for his great swing with wood
4911353 he was a shortstop in high school and hell tell you he could still play there what i like best is that he works so hard to get better there that means a lot to me you see guys who hit like he does and they think they can get enough rbis to make up for their defense
4911354 well let the player show us that as with any player
4911355 there are a lot of players that are drafted to be early arrivals that never arrive pedros abilities to make adjustments will show us how quickly hell get here
4911356 one of the best moments ive had as a professional
4911357 and ive never seen a draft like the one we just had
4911358 its the single best management team in all of baseball maybe in all of sports and everyone including greg and his staff showed that with what they just accomplished
4911359 even if alvarez hadnt accepted our offer the way the process was conducted was what was important
4911360 it shows the plan that was in place the work that went into it
4911361 ive said from the very beginning that its not going to be about how many dollars we spend
4911362 but we pushed hard and were excited with every single player were adding to the organization
4911363 a good draft wouldnt mean anything if we didnt sign people we really wanted
4911364 the old me wouldnt have been very happy with the new me
4911365 teams dont even make offers until hours before the deadline and in many cases minutes before the deadline
4911366 this deadline creates major administrative problems and for most draft picks it removes almost in its entirety the negotiation process
4911367 there is a much greater chance of this having long term impact than grabbing a piece here or there or a short term fix if we get impatient
4911368 we have a plan its a long term plan its an orderly plan this is where we need to be focusing our energy and investments today
4911369 to some degree thats a decision we make to some degree its a decision the players make as we get enough stability throughout the system enough depth we can not only hold onto players but also strategically build oakland has proven you dont have to hang onto every player forever but to put together a team that can consistently compete with enough depth to support it thats where we need to be
4911370 unfortunately were putting a lot of effort into that bottom tier building that foundation but we all look forward to seeing that percolate up to the major league level
4911371 i came out the first inning didnt have any fastball command and they made me pay for it
4911372 im trying anything to be honest ive tried different warmup techniques ive tried different routines it is just one of those things
4911373 we got down big and we havent been swinging the bats well so it was a tough chore to try to come back
4911374 it was nice to see the push in the ninth but it was just too big of a hole we dug early duke is just missing his spots and it just seems to take him two or three innings for him to get into some type of rhythm and when that happens a lot of the damage is done
4911375 one thing my friend and i would do to further that male bonding was to have lunch or dinner with each other we were both divorced and we both had children we were both hurting and needed to be healed i would call him when something went wrong he would call me when something went wrong we struggled through his court dates together and i was there for him to this day i can pick up the phone and call and he will do the same with me

4911810 if the students are studying edgar allen poe for example the teacher can bring video streaming on him right into the classroom
4911811 we have to change the way we teach because students have changed the way they learn you cant stand in front of a group of students anymore and lecture it doesnt work
4911812 youre looking at a future of not even having textbooks having everything online
4911813 we will come up with an implementation plan with the superintendent and technology department
4911814 the superintendent and the board have been great in showing their support for these grants
4911815 you provide an experience for the students and it helps with the transition into higher education

4911827 i dont say it to shock and awe them but because its important and theres so much to learn
4911828 he absolutely was the most positive minded man that ive ever known
4911829 his friends thought he was crazy and wanted to know why he didnt just sit back and relax
4911830 but he wasnt content with just sitting back and doing nothing
4911831 he helped a few of his nieces and nephews go to college and paid their tuition one of them went to law school hes now a lawyer
4911832 he was a mentor to so many people people who were in need

4911834 they gave us a love of traveling the world and respect for other cultures

4911853 the fair policy is to ensure that goods donated at this store remain in this store

4911856 if i dont go in there as much that means im not buying as much

4911864 we are very very careful about how we spend the limited money we do get
4911865 people see what we have how great a park it is and it encourages them to come back

4911868 they are required to demonstrate to the department that they have planned for the most effective technologies for removing hazardous pollutants from the emissions

4911870 this is a serial rapist and vicious murderer who tore apart countless lives during his crime spree
4911871 a lot of the families on the north side are related to each other but over a period of years the kids got disconnected
4911872 were trying to introduce the little ones to each other then by the time they are 12 or 13 theyll know each other as friends
4911873 we got to get all these kids back in sync with each other

4911881 for two months i had this conversation with god i said excuse me but this isnt a safe neighborhood cant you send a big male christian down the street instead of me i kept bringing that to gods attention by his grace he ignored me
4911882 our parents couldnt help us and they were really happy that we were in a country where people help when there is a need
4911883 its a great way for middle and upper class people to recycle furniture we are able to give them a tax write off
4911884 we believe its really gods grace in their life that delivered them from sleeping on the floor we want to give credit to our ceo jesus we dont want to appear like were just a nice group of people we are but thats not what motivates us to do this
4911885 it makes them feel like theyre normal it makes them feel they have a home and that theyre not just squatting someplace theres no longer that feeling that were going to move someplace else next month
4911886 it was like christmas they were bouncing up and down the neighbors came over to see and helped unload the mattress
4911887 i was crying when those beds came it was a real blessing
4911888 i think most americans would look at all those japanese faces and say thats too bad a lot of japanese people died but you get one american face and they might feel a little more of a connection

4911897 its been a long year building up for the olympics
4911898 its one of three races taking on the challenge of winning three golds takes work
4911899 its just incredible physically it wasnt an easy race because of the races yesterday and their close proximity
4911900 i just had my head down and was thinking about the finishing line nothing else i think that race was one ill remember for a long time it just means everything to me
4911901 ive got a gold medal to go after and im not going to give up until i get it
4911902 im delighted there are two british girls in the final wendy and i have been working hard and it has paid off i knew she had it in her she is an awesome athlete and she deserves a medal here
4911903 ive got a goal and ive got confidence in my ability that i can be my best
4911904 for the last four to five months our coach jurgen grobler has told us theres no one who can beat you but some days you dont feel like that
4911905 i didnt realise we were ahead until very close to the finish i just had a sniff that we could do it in the last 200m the last 10 15 strokes were phenomenal it was beyond skill it was just primeval
4911906 if you told us yesterday that we would have been in a position where we might have won a silver medal i would have laughed at you
4911907 i was fifth best today but in the final was a triumph
4911908 i feel empty now but not decimated i gave it my best shot
4911909 i knew when i touched the wall i was going to win the gold but i didnt expect to get the world record
4911910 its always been a goal of mine to do this i never really expected i could do it at this moment in time but its always been at the back of my mind and in my sight i cant believe it i went out so quick its fantastic that all the hard work over the years has paid off im so pleased when i realised i was on my own i just went for it
4911911 i thought id pick up as i went on but i felt really drained my strong point is coming through but i just didnt have it today gutted
4911912 give me another year and i think ill be up there with the girls a 4 40 was sixth in athens so it shows how pole vault has come on so much in the last few years
4911913 the cuban is a very experienced fighter and it showed today
4911914 it was hard to get him im not going to moan about the scoring i got beat fair and square although im disappointed it was a great experience for me and ill still be around for 2012
4911915 i got through my routines so obviously i am pleased with that
4911916 but i am disappointed to miss out on the final
4911917 i thought there might be chinese fireworks or chinese food but its really lacking
4911918 it the chinese government has failed by acting in this way it has shown the world this is a country that does not respect human rights
4911919 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed

4911968 alles bij elkaar van de race met eenhonderdste van een seconde verschil tot aan het wereldrecord van vandaag het is een geweldige ervaring en iets dat me altijd zal bijblijven ik wilde iets doen dat nog nooit iemand anders had gepresteerd dat is gelukt
4911969 het enige wat ik nu even wil is naar mijn moeder toe
4911970 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4911971 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off of earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4911972 processes in the martian soil and gases in the atmosphere
4911973 he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose
4911974 surrender is daily what you give up today you must give up even more tomorrow
4911975 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga
4911976 its a weird feeling because i didnt at any point feel sick or in any distress
4911977 you cant take short cuts in a marathon ive learned that today
4911978 dear child i only did to you what the sparrow did to you i am old when it is fashionable to be young i cry when it is fashionable to laugh
4911979 its a wonder i havent abandoned all my ideals they seem so absurd and impractical
4911980 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
4911981 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
4911982 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
4911983 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it
4911984 we would plan and find the resources to do it
4911985 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
4911986 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around
4911987 but we want to keep everybody safe and its sometimes difficult to simulate that
4911988 we take the sample over to our mobile laboratory and if theyre not able to determine what it is theyll take it over to lawrence livermore
4911989 oh my god like im doing a start up no one else i know is doing a start up so i am taking a lot of risk
4911990 the night of the gun a reporter investigates the darkest story of his life his own
4911991 if i said i was a fat thug who beat up women and sold bad coke would you like my story
4911992 what if instead i wrote i was a recovered addict who obtained custody of my twin girls got us off welfare and raised them myself even though i had a little touch of cancer now were talking both are equally true but as a member of a self interpreting species one that fights to keep disharmony at a remove im inclined to mention my tenderhearted attentions to my children as a single parent before i get around to the fact that i hit their mother when we were together
4911993 s he allowed me to drive her insane over time coming and then leaving loving her and then hitting her
4911994 to be an addict is to be something of a cognitive acrobat you spread versions of yourself around giving each person the truth he or she needs you need actually to keep them at a remove
4911995 in retrospect getting chronically stoned even in high school was dumb like driving through life with the parking brake on
4911996 in a broader sense addiction can be enormously simplifying it leads to a life that is in a way remarkably organized what are we doing today exactly what we did yesterday give or take
4911997 its helpful to think of junkies as like minds with a common interest like folks who knit or clog dance
4911998 part about where you dust yourself off and take over the world
4911999 missed field goal to win the game from the five yard line
4912000 youve got to be able to execute that play thats standard operating procedure i thought wed go to overtime im disappointed
4912001 for i know of the plans i have for you
4912002 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future
4912003 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga
4912004 i completely spaced out on my mark which is my fault ive never done it before and ill probably never do it again but it was just one of those things
4912005 i thought his putt would break a lot and it didnt break thats what i was thinking it doesnt break as much as it looks dont play as much to the left as i first thought
4912006 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4912007 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4912008 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4912009 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4912010 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4912011 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4912012 its been such an unbelievable ride with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
4912013 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional all i want to do is go see my mom
4912014 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4912015 to be honest i was thinking not to blow the lead i was really nervous going into this race i just wanted to take it out as hard as i could and hold on as strong as i could
4912016 there is no comparison in the swimming world to what michaels done
4912017 it would be like playing seven games of a football season and never ever being behind completing every pass
4912018 its a far more competitive world than it was at any other time in the past its unprecedented
4912019 its absolutely amazing that shes going that fast shes truly remarkable
4912020 she gives me hope for another 20 years she was actually talking about childbrith in the ready room
4912021 she said swimming was painful but nothing compared to that
4912022 weve got to get through the end of the game
4912023 its amazing the effort he goes out and gives and to not be rewarded
4912024 it was nice to see us push it in the ninth
4912025 i didnt really feel too comfortable when i first got out there
4912026 i dont know what it was i just felt a little out of whack
4912027 people give pets the love the feel they cant give to others
4912028 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
4912029 im going to speak to the manager this is just ridiculous

4912036 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mom
4912037 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4912038 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honor to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4912039 sullivan came back at the end but i think at the end of a long competition we are all a little tired right now
4912040 in the first 20m i noticed dara torres beside me
4912041 my coach told me the last 10 metres would decide the results
4912042 im thinking i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4912043 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4912044 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4912045 i have raced a lot before i know a lot about running
4912046 i said to myself what happened why are they not coming
4912047 maybe they thought i wouldnt finish in the top three
4912048 i dont want to appear to be putting phelps down
4912049 but i need a little more longevity to name him the best olympian ever
4912050 lets win another nine and no one will remember this one
4912051 here he is this young kid whos able to do it
4912052 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4912053 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4912054 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4912055 how often could you say you saw history being made
4912056 i think its an incredible feat for phelps and im in awe of him
4912057 go phelps and hoff we are proud of you champs
4912058 it makes me feel very nationalistic sitting in front of the television
4912059 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things and gives you something to hope for
4912060 but i do think its great for these kids to have a really good role model instead of all this hip hop crap they have
4912061 each one of those kids wants to be the new michael phelps
4912062 to come here and see my brother out on the field its something you cant even describe
4912063 you just want to be a part of that i wanted to do whatever it took to get here
4912064 hes not here because hes steves brother we wanted to bring eric in to give him a chance
4912065 as soon as i got healthy i wanted to be a bear
4912066 steve said it would be one of the best experiences of my life that i would remember it forever i have no words to tell you how awesome it is
4912067 at least calmed down we laid him down in time give me 100 000 and press them here take document to safe box for she never know
4912068 ped s y no recib s porque ped s mal
4912069 it is evident that man never attains to a true self knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of god and come down after such contemplation to look into himself john calvin
4912070 every time we look at the cross christ seems to be saying to us i am here because of you it is your sin i am bearing your curse i am suffering your debt i am paying your death i am dying nothing in history or in the universe cuts us down to size like the cross all of us have inflated views of ourselves especially in self righteousness until we have visited a place called calvary it is there at the foot of the cross that we shrink to our true size
4912071 we cannot free ourselves from pride and selfish ambition a divine rescue is absolutely necessary
4912072 it was humanly impossible for the disciples to free themselves from their selfish pursuit of self exaltation just as its impossible for us to free ourselves from the very same sins
4912073 z mojego punktu widzenia i wci jestem w kontakcie z francuzami rosjanie by mo e nie dotrzymuj danego s owa

4912076 to learn true humility we need more than a redefinition of greatness we need even more than jesus personal example of humble service what we need is his death
4912077 can anyone be arrogant when he stands beside the cross
4912078 far from offering us flattery the cross undermines our self righteousness and we can stand before it only with a bowed head and broken spirit
4912079 abide close to the cross and search the mystery of his wounds
4912080 thankfulness is a soil in which pride does not easily grow
4912081 if you crossed matthew henrys path you would quickly realize that here was someone taking thankful notice of all god was doing for him and doing so in an attractively joyful way that was infectious
4912082 individuals motivated by self interest self indulgence and a false sense of self sufficiency pursue selfish ambition for the purpose of self glorification
4912083 pride is when sinful human beings aspire to the status and position of god and refuse to acknowledge their dependence upon him
4912084 at every step of our christian development and in every sphere of our christian discipleship pride is the greatest enemy and humility our greatest friend

4912090 we are the swing county in the swing state and a personal visit from the senator will energize volunteers and voters in a huge way
4912091 theres never been enough of a margin in clark county that you can just do average in the rest of the state
4912092 washoe just like every other county in nevada is very important
4912093 we have campaigned there and continue to do so very heavily our grass roots teams have been working hard for months making phone calls and going door to door
4912094 you have the old soccer moms and nascar dads and im wondering if some of these people are moving to the democrats versus where theyve been literally because of some economic anxiety
4912095 washoe county really is a symbolic version of that these people are inclined to be more bread and butter than philosophical voters
4912096 the focus will be the economy and his plan to provide relief for working families
4912097 i anticipate energy will come up probably outsourcing jobs overseas
4912098 i think washoe county has always had an independent streak
4912099 its been misunderstood as this big bastion of conservatism even when the registration numbers were benefiting republicans i always cautioned that those are not automatic republican votes and the democrats are not automatic democratic votes
4912100 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of running i had done wasnt enough
4912101 my calf stiffened up and the pain went all the way up my leg
4912102 i dont regret anything at all if i had stopped all that hard work would have been for nothing
4912103 its not the end we still keep fingers crossed for 2012
4912104 maybe the olympics wont happen for me but how old is constantina

4912111 peters main point in the verse is clear believers who suffer are not dashed to the ground by their troubles they love jesus christ and rejoice in him even though they have never seen him and do not see him now their lives are characterized by a hope that fills the present with love and joy

4912128 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4912129 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference

4912155 i know a lot of people will say that but hes really mature well beyond his years in terms of coaching knowledge its what he was destined to do
4912156 i couldnt ask for a better opportunity at my age let alone a better program to start out with
4912157 it couldnt have worked out better from the standpoint of having him right now finishing up his masters degree so he is still living at home we not only get to face each other on the court but on a daily basis
4912158 nobody whom ive been able to talk to can remember a father and son coaching against each other in an area high school game let alone in the same section
4912159 i knew i wanted basketball to be a part of my life for as long as i can remember
4912160 i think i wanted to coach more to be like my dad he was a role model and when i was little i wanted to be like he was
4912161 as a coachs son he had a little more insight than an average player
4912162 from the time he was in high school he was doing things other high school kids werent
4912163 he would be home breaking down film during his sophomore junior and senior years the past four years hes been helping me in practice hed watch film and point out things that i didnt even see
4912164 all youve got to do is come down to the basement
4912165 well yeah youre in school youre used to seeing the same people all the time
4912166 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4912167 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4912168 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4912169 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4912170 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault

4912201 we believe this is the oldest suspect that weve had arrested to date in our program
4912202 its just a surprise every time what the situation is what are these people thinking
4912203 we all suffer as a result of vehicle theft and insurance fraud were all paying for it

4912206 while laissez faire economy was the product of deliberate state action subsequent restrictions on laissez faire started in a spontaneous way laissez faire was planned planning was not
4912207 was a free trader and an opponent of many eighteenth century restrictions on trade his attitude towards the navigation act of the usury laws shows that he was not dogmatic
4912208 the phrase laissez faire is not to be found in the writings of adam smith of ricardo or of malthus
4912209 is what the economists are supposed to have said it is what the popularisers and the vulgarisers said it is what the utilitarians were driven to believe in if they were to effect a synthesis
4912210 politicians and administrators laissez faire was simply a principle of the ensurance of law and order with the minimum cost and effort
4912211 american capitalism though not perfect was a successful economic system
4912212 reagan and thatcher tried to overthrow the big government interventionist capitalisms that they inherited
4912213 nothing demoralizes the capitalists more than high marginal tax rates the rich are altruistic givers who give in order to get without being sure of the getting
4912214 free markets could never have come into being merely by allowing things to take their course laissez faire itself was enforced by the state laissez faire was not a method to achieve a thing it was the thing to be achieved
4912215 if capitalisms are to be successful in the 21 st century they are likely to be quite different from the models we are familiar with
4912216 what thats crazy how can you write tests before you have any code that doesnt make any sense

4912224 i really truly believe that the impression you make on someone on the radio at one given moment is very fleeting
4912225 as much as they love your song or your record it can be very fleeting if the radio plays it too much but the impression you make on a given evening when its you and them and you make a real connection with an audience that can last forever and does
4912226 i dont really have mixed feelings of performing live at all i love playing
4912227 but performing live is an hour and 15 to two hours out of a 24 hour day and the nature of my mental illness is such that it makes things seem hallucinatory and not real and so the best thing and healthy thing for you is familiar things family friends home those sorts of things and so a succession of very similar hotel rooms is really disorienting to me and can be real difficult its not the time on stage people would ask me if i have stage fright and i would say no i have rest of day fright im so comfortable there i belong on stage i belong writing songs i dont belong necessarily in whatever hotel room im in
4912228 i dont consider myself to be very prolific at all
4912229 its a really big struggle for me to write a song songs take either 30 seconds for me to write or a year or two to piece together depending on the song and how im feeling on any given day i dont really like to write music at all unless im completely unbothered by touring i dont want to be on stage i dont want to be performing i dont want to be anywhere i want to be alone and home and with family and friends and that usually winds up yielding more creativity
4912230 i remember when that first record came out i was pretty amazed
4912231 it didnt sound like anything that was out at the time it was really organic and simple and a lot of the stuff that was coming out at the time was really overproduced and kind of over the top and this seemed like a really nice breath of fresh air and it has been ever since then im a fan
4912232 i remember very clearly the first day maroon was out on the tour my band and i going out in the audience to watch them play and two songs into it looking at each other and going oh they can really play because you never know nowadays its so easy to fake it in the studios and there are lot of bands you see them on some tv show you realize they cant play everybody here can play music and thats kind of the spirit of this tour is that its for real its a great thing a great thing
4912233 i just like the funk of it and i like it because it gives you a lot of room im kind of looking forward to seeing it in the summer because what i like about adam is that hes a real singer and i like to see singers who can take a song from a record and delve into it even more live and give you a little more out of it

4912258 it was more out of interest its completely standard technology i just got the data to see what format it was in
4912259 i dont know if our results were surprising its been known for a long time security people have said this is not a great way of doing things we just did a proof of concept

4912263 galarraga has obviously picked us up tremendously hes done a very good job outstanding job in fact
4912264 hes picked us up pretty good the team was a little short there
4912265 hes pitching better than some of the other guys right now
4912266 it depends on what our pitching staff looks like next year and right now i dont have any idea what it looks like
4912267 i dont know yet if i think i need to freshen somebody up it might

4912277 i mean we expected it to be much tougher but in a best two out of three set doubles match anything can happen and we know that maybe the classic doubles teams are into the semifinals of the olympic games and we have a great challenge coming up
4912278 i think the lead was important it was good to sleep well and start off in a positive mindset and continue what we have been doing
4912279 it has been a great tournament for us weve played well and we improved a lot during the last match they paes bhupathi were a very good doubles team but we played together and played incredible tennis
4912280 getting to play with world number one player is a huge opportunity and its great to be together in the court and hear the crowd root for us

4912309 his own artistic work is significant in the context of his time
4912310 morris considered her his equal and qualitatively the women in this group were every bit as strong
4912311 she seems to have been highly intuitive sensitive her work is in a way more lyrical and poetic whereas morris did a number of paintings in the 1940s that are not passionate but analytical and biting
4912312 i think there is an interview in the new yorker in which she comments

4912321 people get mad at me they call me names i dont care if they become better paddlers i have done my job its all in fun
4912322 he reminds me of my dad trying to teach me eighth grade algebra
4912323 if you dont think you are going to die during a race you arent paddling hard enough
4912324 it is not like baseball and volleyball and you miss the ball if you miss a stroke with your paddle the boat will still go
4912325 you gotta remember at the steel city dragons our charter is to get people in the boat it is not about making people crazy or scared

4912366 we all know the contributions that the navajo families contributed to the initiative that took place during the cold war
4912367 for whatever reason we sit here talking about an issue thats been very devastating for the navajo people we also know that the people of laguna the people of acoma as well as the hopi have similar issues
4912368 as we began to talk and represent our issues questions arose from the committee members i realized that our trustees no matter which department or where they may be had no knowledge of what we were talking about
4912369 within that five year plan as it is today where is that moratorium
4912370 we requested 500 million for cleanup of every site that is within navajo where is that
4912371 again i ask where in the five year plan is that
4912372 we know that you have existing data why can you not begin addressing these needs and these areas of concern that we have put on the table before the oversight committee
4912373 were at a place where water is scarce generally out there when you find water you dont distinguish you give it to your animals you use it in your household
4912374 living out there where the water was scarce the open pit mine was the best thing we had in a sense even in midsummer when it was very hot those are the only things that contained water and that was the drinking area for the livestock as well as for the folks around there
4912375 the other one was more recent we had to bury her on july 27 even to this day ihs doesnt seem to find the research to nail it that its from uranium
4912376 the only conclusion that my late wife could be able to associate it with was when the united states bombed hiroshima you could see those pictures which were similar to the way my sisters were at their late stage before they were ready to leave
4912377 when i go to meetings people share their stories about how the legacy of uranium has impacted their lives they shed their tears from my own experience you just have to shed your tears with them
4912378 i lost my mom and my dad died the same way exposure you hear stories all over it tears your heart out maybe through this workshop we can see something better for our people come out of it the compensation is not worth it i know i would rather have my dad than the money that was sent to my mom for her use
4912379 the only reason i bring that up is a family in oljato
4912380 their son he laid right next to that point source about five years ago that son died from brain cancer

4912460 suggest that women claim they want a nice guy because they believe that that is what is expected of them when in reality they want the so called challenge that comes with dating a not so nice guy
4912461 although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind sensitive and emotionally expressive men the nice guy stereotype contends that when actually presented with a choice between such a nice guy and an unkind insensitive emotionally closed macho man or jerk they invariably reject the nice guy in favor of his
4912462 there is a digital trail of interest left by customers
4912463 one customer found that 10 percent of its population accounted for 60 percent of bargain sales so on the day of the sale you can send a full price ad to everyone else
4912464 i wish i could tell you that our recommendations system was reliable but its not perfect
4912465 but if i know your taste in drama i do not know your taste in horror
4912466 using as much information as you can is very important
4912467 track all clicks the movies that people searched for the pages they jumped to their mouse movements
4912468 i still get e mails from amazon recommending books based on the jared diamond titles i bought three years ago
4912469 i had gone to the farmers market to buy some veggies
4912470 yeah blogging a week or so ago most of the stuff was things id alread figured out most of those guides usually are though some of them can be quite entertaining for example
4912471 rubber band in place of the top button on the jeans trick
4912472 the weakest form the one thats most susceptible to a downturn and this is what were seeing is display advertising
4912473 we were not satisfied with the performance of display advertising on our owned and operated inventory which declined compared to last years first quarter
4912474 a recent shift toward shorter term buying commitments in certain of its customers consumer advertising purchases which the company believes is driven by increased caution in the current business climate
4912475 the new advertisers are more cautious about requiring some sort of proof or evidence that something is working
4912476 its clear to us that were well positioned for 2008 and beyond regardless of the business environment that we find ourselves surrounded by
4912477 in a moderate or even quite severe downturn online advertising actually improves because people switch their advertising budgets out of traditional advertising formats tv radio and print and move more online because its got higher performance its cheaper and its more measurable
4912478 if the downturn is so severe that advertisers stop advertising altogether or face financial difficulties then online is affected like everybody else
4912479 there was a time when we would go out and buy inventory on the portals
4912480 portals make it easier for us to buy and place media on behalf of our clients but as time continues and as analytics capabilities increase you find that your media dollars can work better elsewhere across a range of different sites
4912481 id hate to say were late to the party but were getting our act together for the first time this year we allocated some significant resources to online media
4912482 we have been shifting more and more resources to digital and will continue to do so
4912483 if you think about the fact that industry sales are down this year year to date and when you think about fewer people being in market
4912484 digital is even more important to be able to talk to those consumers who are in market
4912485 let me get back to you mort apparently this new phone has a time travel function i wasnt aware of
4912486 the propensity to truck barter and exchange one thing for another
4912487 nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog
4912488 when you sell to your fellow or buy from the hand of your fellow dont oppress each man his brother
4912489 other stores sell this object for ten dollars but i wont sell it for less than 20
4912490 boy you might not understand but a long long time ago

4912492 this is a great way to be a part of nature rather than fight against it
4912493 as we learn about wildlife we learn to appreciate what a huge impact we humans are having on the rest of the creatures on this planet we are the only hope they have
4912494 it tolerates anything sun shade wet dry its ornamental peeling bark is very attractive in the winter
4912495 and im really starting to push sumac its tough and drought tolerant a plant more people should use its also salt tolerant and takes occasional flooding
4912496 food is best provided by using native plants for their berries seeds nuts nectar pollen and foliage
4912497 natives rather than exotics are preferable because they and their native wildlife have co existed and evolved together to be part of a mutually sustainable environment
4912498 people should vow to help their parents live 100 years without illness suffering afflictions or worries they should also vow to alleviate the suffering of the hungry spirits of seven generations of ancestors to allow them to be born among men and gods and to have blessing and bliss without limit
4912499 this festival is a chance for guilty homeless spirits to be pardoned people worship ghosts and release animals such as birds or fish
4912500 i am going to the pagoda this year to pray for my mother because we are miles apart my mother is living in my hometown in the central province of binh dinh i always think of her
4912501 although nowadays the youth live faster and are becoming more unfamiliar with traditional values they still deeply love and respect their parents
4912502 thats why many youngsters visit pagodas and present their parents with flowers on this day
4912503 the festival is no longer exclusively for buddhists but an occasion for everyone to express their love to their parents this cultural trait has not faded over time but become more and more diversified
4912504 when i was 11 years old i received a gift of happiness from god
4912505 i was riding my bicycle when a strong gust of wind blew me onto the ground into the path of an oncoming truck the truck ran over me and cut off my leg
4912506 as i lay there bleeding i realized that i might have to live the rest of my life without a leg how depressing but then i realized that being depressed wont get my leg back so i decided right then and there not to waste my life despairing
4912507 when my parents arrived at the hospital they were shocked and grieving so i told them ive already adapted now you also have to get used to this
4912508 ever since then i see my friends getting upset over little things their bus came late they got a bad grade on a test somebody insulted them but i just enjoy life
4912509 my whole life would improve if i had a new car
4912510 i just need a better job and then i can relax and be happy

4912516 ah i guess theyre not so bad i can see
4912517 once i know the tools for being happy then it will work like magic
4912518 if i become content and satisfied with what i have ill lose my motivation to achieve more
4912519 i have a boat do you want to go fishing
4912520 happiness is optional if i want to be depressed thats my own prerogative
4912521 who forgot the forks its too hot for volleyball i want to go home already
4912522 auntie i came here to suffer with you today but before we suffer it is only fair that you also share with me five pleasures that you had today
4912523 was it sweet warm did the aroma linger did it give you energy
4912524 did you wash your face was it pleasant warm refreshing
4912525 and they say that alcoholics are always alcoholics even when theyre dry as my lips for years even when theyre stranded on a small desert island with no place in two thousand miles to buy beer and i wonder is he different has he changed what hes about or is he just a liar with nothing to lie about am i headed for the same brick wall is there anything i can do about anything at all

4912549 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4912550 i know its tough right now cuz they lost a couple games and theyre not used to losing
4912551 when we get some guys on it puts a little more pressure on the kids to do something theyre not used to doing maybe
4912552 a lot of those teams play year round where we dont get that chance and theyre used to being in front of all these crowds where ours havent been
4912553 were telling them we want to be a spoiler to hawaii
4912554 give them a loss and also get a win for the first time in the world series
4912555 and i keep telling the kids to relax and have some fun and play the game they like to play
4912556 we had a lot of close calls last year and a lot of games could have went either way and some of them didnt go our way
4912557 so were hoping that in a lot of situations the ball will bounce in our favor a little bit and actually hopefully we can control our destiny a little bit more and not hope that it comes down to luck
4912558 but were looking for a much better season we know we have a much better team and if we just control the ball and have a little bit more ball security were going to be a pretty dominant team on offense and defense
4912559 i know that we have improved but as to what scale i dont know
4912560 weve looked pretty pure in all the organized team activities in the offseason communication has been great adjustments have been very well so were playing together very well it just still remains to be seen how much weve improved
4912561 obviously its just his presence as far the pass rush goes
4912562 everybody knows what he can do against the pass and hes proven that in the years before in kansas city i think obviously people are going to be looking for an improved pass defense but theres a lot that goes into it its not just one guy
4912563 we have to shore up a lot of stuff in the back seven and kind of let the guys up front do the work so well see we obviously are very excited for it we cant wait for the season to start and see how well we do
4912564 im not throwing that hard but everything feels good it doesnt hurt at all so everything is fine
4912565 yeah im throwing my pitches throwing my changeups a lot everything im throwing everything right now im throwing 93 94 miles per hour tops and so everything is fine
4912566 im feeling comfortable throwing my pitches and youve just got to take it one by one get ready for my next start i mean its fine i dont get sore at all so everything is good
4912567 hes helping me stay patient and not rush too much
4912568 weve got some really young talented kids and i think weve got some tremendous battles going on
4912569 ryan wynn we think is going to be one of our better offensive linemen as he progresses were playing him at right tackle some now ned tavale is having a good camp along with chris bunders theyre in good competition and dom alford at left tackle has really been a solid player for us so we dont have a whole lot of experience up front but weve got some talented guys that i think are really going to grow together in a very strong way
4912570 so the muslims now have the consciousness that in reality islam has remained in the end as the more vigorous religion and that they have something to say to the world indeed are the essential religious force of the future before the shariah and all those things had already left the scene in a sense now there is a new pride thus a new zest a new intensity about wanting to live islam has awakened this is its great power we have a moral message that has existed without interruption since the prophets and we will tell the world how to live it whereas the christians certainly cant we must naturally come to terms with this inner power of islam
4912571 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4912572 a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership
4912573 though appearing separately the candidates will field similar questions about their faith abortion same sex marriage and humanitarian efforts abroad

4912578 my parents say i should be a photographer when i grow older ive already taken many pictures i take them all the time i photograph everything and save them on my computer
4912579 they are very conscious and well meaning people but they themselves havent got the exposure to a lot of career choices
4912580 the corporate world has the great responsibility to partner with them to help giving them back inside information
4912581 think about the wildest thing you could think about you can do that
4912582 the word from moscow is that the russians have come under attack by the georgians but the georgians are saying this is a pretext for russia to move a column of armour toward tblisi
4912583 we were able to move the ball a little bit but the penalties really hurt us we definitely have things to work on but there is still some time for that
4912584 working with them all week we knew what they were going to play and they werent really going to stray from that it comes down to executing if they man up or play zone we still have to make plays we still have a vanilla offense and dont want to show our hand this time of year
4912585 we pretty much knew what they were going to do we didnt expect anything different we practiced against them all week they knew what we were going to do offensively we knew what they were going to do defensively we just had to come out and try to execute
4912586 they knew what we were going to do and we had to make

4912600 well somebodys gonna a i think i would throw up too so itd probably something along the lings of
4912601 some combination of easy money loose lending greed and fraud
4912602 no matter how you look at these data it is obvious that the current state of the single family housing market remains grim
4912603 more likely well be well into 2009 before we start describing this housing cycle as in recovery
4912604 we have not seen a nationwide decline in housing like this since the great depression
4912605 its interesting that the industry has invented new ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine
4912606 the fed replaced one bubble mostly confined to the technology sector with another far larger bubble encompassing most of the housing market
4912607 removed minimized and postponed the consequences of poor lending decisions
4912608 anything containing the words home or real estate seemed to be as hot as anything with a dot com during the late 1990s

4912610 all asleep at the switch with respect to ridiculous mortgage products

4912617 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4912618 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4912619 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4912620 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4912621 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4912622 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4912628 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4912629 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4912630 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4912631 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4912632 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4912633 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4912634 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

4912648 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

4912654 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4912655 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4912656 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4912657 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4912658 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4912659 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4912660 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4912661 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4912662 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4912663 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4912664 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4912665 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4912666 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4912667 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4912668 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4912669 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4912670 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4912671 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4912672 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4912673 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4912674 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4912675 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4912676 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4912677 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion

4912680 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4912681 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4912682 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4912683 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4912684 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4912685 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4912686 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4912687 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4912688 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4912689 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4912690 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

4912696 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4912697 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4912698 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4912699 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4912700 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4912701 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4912702 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4912703 how cool is this to be wandering through a rainforest jungle in the rain
4912704 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4912705 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4912706 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4912707 during a call use the speakerphone key in conjunction with the left soft key to activate the speakerphone operation
4912708 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4912709 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4912710 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4912711 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4912712 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4912713 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4912714 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4912715 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4912716 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4912717 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4912718 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4912719 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4912720 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4912721 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4912722 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4912723 it seems like everyday im in sort of a dream world
4912724 sometimes you still have to pinch yourself to see if its really real im just happy im in the real world
4912725 i think if we would do this again i would win
4912726 it was a real honor to be able to race with michael phelps
4912727 people will be asking this for years you know you won that race
4912728 you hear him do his arm slap it gets your heart racing
4912729 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4912730 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4912731 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4912732 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4912733 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4912734 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4912735 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4912736 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4912737 how you can make 50 000 in the next 60 days
4912738 a lot of evils been perpetuated based on the claim that we were fighting evil
4912739 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4912740 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4912741 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4912742 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4912743 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4912744 given the spread of taliban control in this country it is difficult to know how much anyone could have done to push back the taliban
4912745 mr berniers comments several months ago may have put the government of afghanistan in a bit of tight spot obviously they have to be seen as making these decisions on their own in their own time and in their own way
4912746 there have been real issues around corruption in kandahar so any steps we can take to deal with that are important steps
4912747 now russia needs to honor its agreement and remove its forces and of course end military operations
4912748 we can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection
4912749 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
4912750 creal wouldnt think of going back to a five day week id be tarred and feathered for even suggesting it he says which also means its unlikely summer vacation will get downsized anytime soon
4912751 goats are extremely cute and fairly intelligent for livestock and importantly delicious food page 54 source national center on time and learning
4912752 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4912753 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4912754 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4912755 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4912756 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4912757 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4912758 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4912759 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4912760 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4912761 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4912762 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4912763 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4912764 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4912765 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4912766 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4912767 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4912768 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4912769 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4912770 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4912771 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4912772 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4912773 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4912774 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4912775 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4912776 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4912777 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4912778 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4912779 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4912780 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4912781 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4912782 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4912783 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4912784 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4912785 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4912786 we love this land and we would like to live in palestine in peace as humans with equal rights and responsibilities regardless of our religion or culture and without being superior lawmakers or oppressive thieves
4912787 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4912788 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4912789 the most important thing about living is to learn from the past not to fear it and always look to the future with one eye and to the now with the other
4912790 it will be exactly 19 years on 4 july since burmas military arrested win tin the government which has a responsibility to protect the life of its citizens should now release him
4912791 he should be moved to a hospital as quickly as possible
4912792 its my first time playing in a while rutley said im just trying to get back into the swing of things
4912793 hes made some really dynamic plays on the practice field coach dick tomey said
4912794 we expected him to be very good but to be honest hes better than i thought hed be because i didnt know hed adapt as quickly as he has
4912795 it was tough at first to only be able to watch last year but it was good for me because i got to see what the college game was like without being in it rutley said
4912796 jordan may be a little ahead but its too close tomey said
4912797 we just need more evidence it could be that theyll all get opportunities through the year because you never know what can happen
4912798 were just really banged up right now like every football team in the country tomey said
4912799 it feels good hitting the sled again paysinger said im pain free but we want to be safe some days its still a little sore i just have to work back into it
4912800 its unbelievable the best ive seen since weve been here said right tackle chris marinelli
4912801 a legitimate all pac 10 type of guy coach jim harbaugh said thats good news because smiths return from a kneecap injury is unknown
4912802 it was tough last season because i spent most of camp playing right tackle and then allen got hurt and i moved over to left muth said
4912803 its been nice being over here since spring and im really feeling comfortable
4912804 hes played in big games he played half the usc game he played the cal game hes a guy thats really come into his own
4912805 were still trying to work out a few kinks muth said
4912806 but overall im liking what im seeing the thing thats really helped is weve had pretty much the same five guys starting since spring so every practice weve been taking all the reps
4912807 last year i was so concerned about getting the play in and getting the play called and getting in and out of the huddle said pritchard who is currently no
4912808 his sister told me that min ko naing was suffering from high blood pressure an eye infection and gout his family has sent him medicine but his health has not improved yet
4912809 his family is very worried about min ko naings health because his request for proper medical treatment is still being denied

4912812 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilise or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4912813 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4912814 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4912815 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4912816 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4912817 but for the most part i feel comfortable in this uniform
4912818 were going to every neighborhood in the city working with the community to turn liabilities into assets
4912819 when we demolish condemned structures we want to fold those vacant lots into greenspaces were not just targeting vacant lots were doing post demo greening
4912820 the program is one of the most popular initiatives the mayor has started communities want to take back their communities and the mayor wants to help them do that
4912821 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4912822 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4912823 this board has taken action without even discussing it with me
4912824 i think its a clear message that we do respect his contract rights but that we have a responsibility to the ratepayers
4912825 im innocent and i want the opportunity to prove it
4912826 the last thing we need is a hostile work environment
4912827 there are other facts that will come to light as we move forward that quite frankly you just havent found out about
4912828 corby officially gets today on indonesias independence day a three month cut off her sentence
4912829 were here today looking for any witnesses to what happened early last saturday morning

4912832 this happened two days after he came home to sydney
4912833 his mother got a text about five or six hours before he was attacked saying he was at a party having a great time
4912834 a brutal and cowardly attack occurred just at the intersection of kidman street and he was left in a grave condition on the footpath
4912835 he was discovered a short time later by another gentleman who was on his way home

4912853 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned
4912854 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4912855 we still see the next few months as being quite rough
4912856 the cycle has turned and the australian dollar likely has more downside ahead of it possibly taking it back to around us0 80
4912857 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
4912858 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
4912859 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
4912860 mein trainer hat mir beigebracht so gro e tr ume wie m glich zu haben
4912861 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4912862 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4912863 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4912864 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4912865 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4912866 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4912867 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4912868 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4912869 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4912870 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4912871 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4912872 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4912873 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4912874 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4912875 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4912876 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4912877 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4912878 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4912879 im the owner of this joint i choose the numbers i direct them i arrange them you have any complaints you just come to me and ill throw you right out on your ass

4912881 ive never seen anything like it the talent in this conference is amazing
4912882 of course i am but thats a hard question to answer without sounding cocky
4912883 if you look at the legend of chase daniel three or four years from now its not going to be based on my yards or my touchdowns or my interceptions its going to be based on wins
4912884 these other guys are good quarterbacks but i have supreme confidence in my abilities as a leader and playmaker
4912885 i always go with the guy that led the nation in passing
4912886 cody might be the 12th best quarterback in the conference
4912887 so many people said it couldnt be done phelps said
4912888 i dont know what to feel i have so many emotions going through my head so much excitement its been nothing but an upward roller coaster ride and its been nothing but fun
4912889 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4912890 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4912891 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4912892 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire
4912893 and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4912894 thats what im thinking but i dont really know right now
4912895 i just got hit on it so were just taking it from there
4912896 he can be called the best olympian of all time
4912897 not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4912898 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4912899 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4912900 its unbelievable the best ive seen since weve been here said right tackle chris marinelli
4912901 a legitimate all pac 10 type of guy coach jim harbaugh said thats good news because smiths return from a kneecap injury is unknown
4912902 it was tough last season because i spent most of camp playing right tackle and then allen got hurt and i moved over to left muth said
4912903 its been nice being over here since spring and im really feeling comfortable
4912904 hes played in big games he played half the usc game he played the cal game hes a guy thats really come into his own
4912905 were still trying to work out a few kinks muth said
4912906 but overall im liking what im seeing the thing thats really helped is weve had pretty much the same five guys starting since spring so every practice weve been taking all the reps
4912907 last year i was so concerned about getting the play in and getting the play called and getting in and out of the huddle said pritchard who is currently no
4912908 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilise or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4912909 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4912910 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4912911 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4912912 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4912913 under the cyclone circumstances they were trying to save their lives because apparently the cyclone was hitting the prison so they were trying to save their lives and there are some reports that there are 30 or 40 perhaps a number of killings in the situation in insein prison
4912914 i am very concerned because i do not know so far about his whereabouts i do not know if he is in detention in the police station or where so i ask for clarification from the government on that
4912915 esa cosita de no haber podido ver cumplida la ilusi n de llegar entre las diez primeras
4912916 the arrests are now increasing especially of people actively helping cyclone survivors we dont know the reasons for the arrests
4912917 if you plant hatred those weeds will attempt to drown out the good seeds
4912918 we want to plant seeds of harmony and respect throughout the community
4912919 blue cross blueshield of tennessee will not stand for this behavior
4912920 bcbst has a proud history of diversity we do not discriminate on the basis of race national origin gender sexual orientation age or faith
4912921 shadowrun is a bit like mild cheddar mild cheddar is essentially the stuff that people buy when they like the idea of having cheese on toast or cheese in a sandwhich but they dont actually like the taste of cheese shadowrun is cyberpunk for people who actually dont really like cyberpunk they just like the idea of playing cyberpunk
4912922 theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4912923 he gets it done again he gets it done again
4912924 where shall i cum a man can be strong with his woman but must also be moment i had almost forgotten about it gaywheels com has just most recently listed out the vehicles that took the most interest among all gay and lesbian car aficionados enthusiasts and shoppers shocked at the aggressive sexuality of these pretty little girls and as she watched she was mesmerized by their erotic appearance music html
4912925 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4912926 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4912927 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4912928 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4912929 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4912930 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4912931 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4912932 we had a lot of close calls last year and a lot of games could have went either way and some of them didnt go our way
4912933 so were hoping that in a lot of situations the ball will bounce in our favor a little bit and actually hopefully we can control our destiny a little bit more and not hope that it comes down to luck
4912934 but were looking for a much better season we know we have a much better team and if we just control the ball and have a little bit more ball security were going to be a pretty dominant team on offense and defense
4912935 i know that we have improved but as to what scale i dont know
4912936 weve looked pretty pure in all the organized team activities in the offseason communication has been great adjustments have been very well so were playing together very well it just still remains to be seen how much weve improved
4912937 obviously its just his presence as far the pass rush goes
4912938 everybody knows what he can do against the pass and hes proven that in the years before in kansas city i think obviously people are going to be looking for an improved pass defense but theres a lot that goes into it its not just one guy
4912939 we have to shore up a lot of stuff in the back seven and kind of let the guys up front do the work so well see we obviously are very excited for it we cant wait for the season to start and see how well we do
4912940 im not throwing that hard but everything feels good it doesnt hurt at all so everything is fine
4912941 yeah im throwing my pitches throwing my changeups a lot everything im throwing everything right now im throwing 93 94 miles per hour tops and so everything is fine
4912942 im feeling comfortable throwing my pitches and youve just got to take it one by one get ready for my next start i mean its fine i dont get sore at all so everything is good
4912943 hes helping me stay patient and not rush too much
4912944 weve got some really young talented kids and i think weve got some tremendous battles going on
4912945 ryan wynn we think is going to be one of our better offensive linemen as he progresses were playing him at right tackle some now ned tavale is having a good camp along with chris bunders theyre in good competition and dom alford at left tackle has really been a solid player for us so we dont have a whole lot of experience up front but weve got some talented guys that i think are really going to grow together in a very strong way
4912946 theres not that much difference between them and yet the media gets on young and doesnt criticize mauer the radio caller said
4912947 your appointment is at 3 00pm dr f will be waiting for you in his consulting room
4912948 you still have considerable bruising from our session two weeks ago
4912949 you have done much talking about submission and discipline zita
4912950 is it a metaphor for a selflessness and humanity you otherwise fear you do not possess or a real desire
4912951 you throw around the word master as though its a game a though that is something you grant a man for all your academic musings on natural order and the flaws in modern pornographic works depicting bdsm you seem to have entirely missed the point
4912952 do you really think that you could be a slave
4912953 dont call me master i have not decided whether you are fit to serve me call me elias
4912954 i will take only what you see fit to give me
4912955 ask me to give you more so i can punish you
4912956 now you are going to perform a service for your master
4912957 i havent washed today for you to enjoy me dirty
4912958 one of the big positives is going to be the oil price thats going to be the major point of differentiation between bhp and rio tinto as far as the market is concerned
4912959 we saw spot oil prices hit a record high of us147 per barrel and that has to have a positive rub off on their earnings
4912960 we still see the next few months as being quite rough
4912961 the cycle has turned and the australian dollar likely has more downside ahead of it possibly taking it back to around us0 80
4912962 its a lot less humane to let a horse starve all winter than to take them to slaughter
4912963 slaughter is a necessary component of our industry and we should establish rules to let horses going to slaughter be handled in a humane way
4912964 there is definitely a higher volume of unwanted horses and no place for them to go
4912965 the unwanted horse coalition was created under the american horse council to help deal with this problem nationwide
4912966 people have given up trying to sell them and are now trying to give them away im afraid weve only seen the tip of the iceberg right now it takes a 1 200 pound horse a long time to starve to death so you can say what you want about slaughter but its certainly quicker than starving to death
4912967 we work so hard on this issue because its very inhumane and traumatic for the horses
4912968 regardless of what the animal rights people say the horses in the u s were slaughtered in a humane way
4912969 now weve made it so the unwanted horses have to be exported for slaughter which is much more inhumane than anything that happened in the u s
4912970 we are overwhelmed with phone calls for people that cant take care of their horses anymore so weve started an adoption program
4912971 the plants being closed and the price of hay grain and diesel fuels have created a perfect storm for the horse industry resulting in the decrease of the horses value and an excess of unwanted horses
4912972 if all unwanted horses are euthanized where do we put 100 000 bodies
4912973 a national awareness of the cruelty inherent in the modern diet and an alteration in peoples food choices
4912974 the decision by the burmese authorities to extend the house arrest of aung san suu kyi
4912975 reports that the burmese army murdered political prisoners in the aftermath of cyclone nargis
4912976 deplores the ongoing imprisonment by the burmese authorities of victims of cyclone nargis who attempt to seek aid from international aid organisations in burma
4912977 to stop official interference in the delivery of aid and to cooperate fully with humanitarian organisations
4912978 to lift all restrictions on peaceful political activities in the country and to move towards an inclusive process of national reconciliation and restoration of democracy the rule of law and full respect for human rights
4912979 urges the burmese authorities to enter into close dialogue with the un special rapporteur and to accept his request to visit burma
4912980 to put serious pressure on the burmese authorities to bring about democratic change
4912981 by bill daniel which i collaboratively designed and directed with gary phil and sam from the holster we all lovingly labored over this project for two months while simultaneously i was homeless and tramping around new york definitely an interesting time in my life

4913012 do you know where i can get some food that isnt turtle related
4913013 i told my daughter of this mike gentlemen and how she was to pass the word down to her daughter
4913014 you are an odd man by the way how are things going with you and mary
4913015 dont you mean how are things going with me finding mary
4913016 no you are still staying at her house are you not
4913017 the whole neighborhood heard you two together last night you should be glad her husband is not around because if he were then he would chop off your penis
4913018 its not like theres much to lose wait a minute are you saying that i just fucked the virgin mary
4913019 well if she was a virgin before shes not anymore
4913020 theres no way this is the same woman besides all the virgin mary statues are of a white women and this bitch is brown
4913021 no your not your just gaining weight because your letting yourself go
4913022 i always said that if i had a son that i would call him jesus
4913023 wow i didnt expect to see you back so soon
4913024 and it should seeing as how you didnt fuck anything up
4913025 so did you find out if the virgin mary was really a virgin or not
4913026 well on that note ill be leaving oh by the way i met one of your great grand fathers and he was a complete idiot
4913027 well i dont suppose that a relative from so many years back would have much in common with me at all
4913028 well now that i know your home safe and sound im gonna go home and feed my turtles
4913029 ive been warned about guys named mike apparently at first my long lost relatives believed that we women should rip off our clothes and please you till you cry but then the same great grandmother who passed this information down found out about a man named mike that knocked up her friend and then bailed so we karuna women were then told to kick any neighbor we have named mike in the junk
4913030 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4913031 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4913032 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4913033 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4913034 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4913035 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4913036 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4913037 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4913038 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4913039 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4913040 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4913041 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4913042 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4913043 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4913044 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4913045 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4913046 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4913047 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4913048 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4913049 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4913050 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4913051 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4913052 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4913053 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4913054 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4913055 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4913056 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4913057 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4913058 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4913059 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4913060 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4913061 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4913062 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4913063 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4913064 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4913065 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4913066 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4913067 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4913068 to come here and see my brother out on the field its something you cant even describe
4913069 you just want to be a part of that i wanted to do whatever it took to get here
4913070 hes not here because hes steves brother we wanted to bring eric in to give him a chance
4913071 as soon as i got healthy i wanted to be a bear
4913072 steve said it would be one of the best experiences of my life that i would remember it forever i have no words to tell you how awesome it is
4913073 the prisoners receive regular medical check up by the prison doctors and when a prisoner needs a special attention of the specialist the prison authority arranges him her to see the specialist medical practitioners
4913074 if and when it is necessary i am going to broaden and deepen this process in my dialogue with the myanmar authorities
4913075 you have my firm commitment and assurances that i will work very hard to help the myanmar people to enjoy genuine freedom and democracy
4913076 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4913077 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4913078 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4913079 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4913080 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4913081 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4913082 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4913083 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4913084 who are open to doing something on the production side
4913085 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4913086 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4913087 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4913088 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4913089 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4913090 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4913091 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4913092 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4913093 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4913094 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4913095 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4913096 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4913097 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4913098 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4913099 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4913100 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4913101 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4913102 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4913103 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4913104 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4913105 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4913106 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4913107 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4913108 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4913109 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4913110 its my first time playing in a while rutley said im just trying to get back into the swing of things
4913111 hes made some really dynamic plays on the practice field coach dick tomey said
4913112 we expected him to be very good but to be honest hes better than i thought hed be because i didnt know hed adapt as quickly as he has
4913113 it was tough at first to only be able to watch last year but it was good for me because i got to see what the college game was like without being in it rutley said
4913114 jordan may be a little ahead but its too close tomey said
4913115 we just need more evidence it could be that theyll all get opportunities through the year because you never know what can happen
4913116 were just really banged up right now like every football team in the country tomey said
4913117 it feels good hitting the sled again paysinger said im pain free but we want to be safe some days its still a little sore i just have to work back into it
4913118 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4913119 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4913120 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4913121 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4913122 i love all kinds of art and i love music i enjoy rap hip hop reggae reggaeton and soul music i have to listen to it everywhere i go i draw and paint too but i dont have much time for that im into computers and sometimes if i have a little time i like to play computer games i like to watch the simpsons and south park on tv my life has become very busy since i started to model for score people ask me how i became a score model i discovered score when i answered their website beascoremodel com
4913123 karina hart has ruined me for all other women her breasts are perfect and the curve of her hips and ass are absolutely divine miss hart is perfectly proportioned from top to bottom while your pictures are a good start this is a woman who should have her likeness immortalized in marble she is far and away the most incredible model i have ever laid eyes on and definitely a future member of the pantheon of greats thank you for bringing us this truly tremendous discovery she already has my vote for newcomer of the year

4913127 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4913128 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4913129 youre talking about a guy whos a surefire hall of famer in his sport
4913130 theres been a lot of great players but hes the only one of the real superstars that has played with an organization at that kind level and for that long
4913131 you have to win a championship to be even considered
4913132 for someone like me who likes both sports baseball and basketball its pretty difficult to pick one thats actually better
4913133 theyre pretty equal to be honest with you with what theyve done
4913134 why not go out on a limb thats where the fruit is
4913135 i may disagree with what you have to say but i shall defend to the death your right to say it
4913136 its tough to play after you shoot 61 and i thought i played good
4913137 unless you get off to a really hot start you feel like youre behind the eight ball
4913138 why did pentagram design this at such a small width
4913139 i got four matches in this week which is what i was looking for
4913140 it would have been great to play five but ill go to new haven hoping to find a little more rhythm and build up to the u s open
4913141 iraq bringing benzene and gasoline from outside its a joke
4913142 we need equipment we need instruments we need a lot of technical help
4913143 these deals themselves are not likely to be hugely lucrative
4913144 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4913145 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4913146 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4913147 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4913148 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4913149 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4913150 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease

4913152 auf vielen b rgerjournalismus websites kann man schreiben was man will
4913153 bei uns muss man einen gewissen mindeststandard einhalten wir haben kein interesse an unsinn aber ehrlich gesagt wir bekommen auch nicht viele unsinnige beitr ge das ist f r uns kein gro es problem
4913154 ganz im gegenteil wir wollen sehr gerne wissen was so jemand zu sagen hat aber er muss in seinem text offenlegen wer er ist

4913158 dave wannstedt is the right guy for the right job at absolutely the right time pitt is on the cusp of becoming a perennial top 10 team all the needed state of the art facilities are in place and dave is the element that will take the program to another level
4913159 i think it is very clear this program is on the rise and dave has it headed in the right direction
4913160 i am very happy the administration stuck by him and has shown some patience because more often than not that isnt the case coaches who come in usually have a mess to clean up and by the time they are done straightening it out theyve had a few losing seasons and they are fired
4913161 but if you look at this situation dave has recruited extremely well hes built a great base of talent that talent is starting to mature and more importantly he is bringing in the right kinds of players kids that work hard are good students and dont embarrass the university this thing is being built for the long haul
4913162 look at how many guys with much bigger names than me guys like mike ditka dan marino tony dorsett that they could have chosen to do this and they asked me so there was no way i could pass up this opportunity
4913163 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

4913169 memang patut kedua duanya bermuhabalah dalam islam pun ada kita ajak ramai ramai sembahyang hajat dan bersumpah dan kalau siapa salah biar allah tunjukkan
4913170 tindakan bersumpah dengan menggunakan kitab suci adalah amalan orang kristian yang melakukannya dengan menggunakan kitab injil bukannya umat islam
4913171 dalam islam hanya ada lian iaitu sumpah antara suami dan isteri yang menuduh pasangan mereka melakukan zina dalam hal ini anwar dan saiful bukan suami isteri
4913172 mahkamah membenarkan anwar bertanding dalam pilihanraya dan itu menunjukkan beliau tidak bersalah lagipun yang mendakwa saiful sepatutnya ada empat orang saksi atau kedua dua pihak harus berikrar ingin saya tegaskan disini bahawa pas tetap menyokong anwar dalam pilihanraya kecil permatang pauh pada 26 ogos ini

4913182 what if joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him
4913183 dont be afraid am i in the place of god you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives so then dont be afraid i will provide for you and your children
4913184 this is how i want you to conduct yourself in these matters if you enter your place of worship and about to make an offering you suddenly remember a grudge a friend has against you abandon your offering leave immediately go to this friend and make things right then and only then come back and work things out with god

4913220 buy a stack of discs get a copy of his dvds or a membership to pptv and burn to disc all you can afford and get them out to everyone you can
4913221 when buying and selling are controlled by legislation the first things to be bought and sold are legislators
4913222 yup go a head and burn them plus a copyright suit has to involve some type of monetary loss you cant sue someone if they copy your work and give it out for free you can sue someone if they are selling fake copies of your work though and i think you can sue someone whos doing it for free in order to make them stop then it becomes a criminal offense but yea buy a copy of truth rising and pay the 6 bucks a month for a pptv membership even if you dont use it if 100 000 of us did that hed gross 600 000 month plus his sponsor income plus his dvd sales i dont know what his expenses are but i assume 600 000 month or hell half of that 300 000 a month with 50 000 people would be a good budget to work with even 10 000 memberships would equal 60 000 that 6 bucks a month is important

4913239 last year i was so concerned about getting the play in and getting the play called and getting in and out of the huddle said pritchard who is currently no
4913240 it makes it difficult when your long man starts and youve got to go get him
4913241 this is how you learn to do it but youve got to be smart about it this is a pretty good warning sign so well back sanchez off were watching all these guys
4913242 those guys were hard on their arms theyd have high pitch counts in the fifth and sixth innings

4913257 illegal logging especially in the tropics is causing huge environmental and social damage and undermines the markets for legal forest products
4913258 the government continues to talk about the problem but does nothing we need regulations now to stem the multi million dollar import of illegal wood products into new zealand
4913259 illegal logging and the destruction of rainforests have unfairly sullied the reputation of all wood and forest products even those derived from sustainably managed plantation forests

4913283 perhaps the most important single issue of agreement for ordinary new zealanders was that on progressing retirement savings portability between the two countries
4913284 a memorandum of understanding to formalise portability arrangements will be signed in october
4913285 legislation in 2009 will then bring the proposed portability regime into effect
4913286 superannuation minister nick sherry estimated that of the 13 billion in lost accounts under the asg a considerable amount of this money will belong to new zealanders who have returned home
4913287 with portability he has undertaken to have new zealanders accounts in the australian system proactively identified this would be a huge bonus for many new zealanders

4913367 these elections are a vote for the image and future of kadima and afterwards for the future of israel we can return kadima to what it should have been and we must not ignore the fact that we have been given a second chance to do so today we have the opportunity to fulfill the dream that we had when we established kadima
4913368 kadima represents in my eyes the wide common agreement in israel in terms of diplomatic economic and social policy
4913369 we are going to win twice inside kadima and afterwards in the general elections whenever they may be
4913370 they are both right in their criticism of each other barak failed as prime minister and as labor chairman and livni doesnt have enough experience to lead the government weve already done enough experiments on this matter we have paid a heavy price and i dont have the privilege of carrying out another experiment
4913371 kadima members know that we will continue to lead the country with responsibility and consideration and we will strive to achieve peace without selling our national and strategic assets
4913372 to reach achievements such as these and to ensure the future and security of israel strong leadership is needed leadership that knows to guide with experience and ability to make decisions even when they are difficult ones
4913373 despite the challenges facing israel and decisions that must be made the kadima contenders could not even reach a decision on primaries in their party without the labor partys intervention
4913374 what we need is dedicated leadership no marketing gimmick can cover up the need for such experienced leadership you know i have it

4913379 en cuanto a la f rmula que determina el monto econ mico a asignar a los partidos pol ticos es discutible pero esta es una decisi n que corresponde a los diputados se trat de una reforma constitucional aprobada y no tenemos margen como ejecutivo para observar somos sensibles a la opini n p blica y sabemos que hay reclamos
4913380 porque quieren seguir teniendo el control de los candidatos y futuros gobernantes
4913381 este es un gran miedo que tenemos en la iniciativa privada que se pueda aprovechar esta coyuntura de la solicitud de las plazas del gobierno de jalisco a cambio de no establecer una controversia constitucional y eso no lo permitiremos como ciudadanos

4913393 we won thats the most important thing thats what we were looking for we won
4913394 you knew if we didnt score i had a chance to go back out there again and get some outs and give a chance for the guys to score thats what we did
4913395 they were all great and we asked a lot of innings out of them
4913396 the pen came in and really shut the door our pitchers did a good job of holding them down
4913397 you feel great when you finally come through in a tight game
4913398 its good to do the job with men on base we havent much
4913399 for robinson its not a lack of effort it just hasnt been the year all of us expected him to have
4913400 there were a lot of opportunities for us before gardy comes up with the big hit i dont know how to explain it other than to say sometimes it looks easy but just a fraction of a second off and its an out
4913401 when i first came up against fulchino in the 13th i was just looking for a good pitch to get wood on the ball and then after fouling them both off im suddenly 0 2 then after getting the count back to 3 2 i knew fulchino would want to come in with a fastball rather than risking walking me and having to pitch to johnny damon and thats what i got
4913402 that was something we tried friday night and it didnt work
4913403 johnny just wasnt comfortable doing it and thats the way it is
4913404 its a good thing we were playing at home so we had the last at bat
4913405 ninety five percent of my opponents dont give a damn about all the injuries on my team and the other 5 are glad i have them
4913406 i cant worry about guys on the disabled list i only deal with the living
4913407 the first thing that came across my mind was that i didnt feel good about coming into the clubhouse
4913408 once i walked through the door it was a bitter thought like a rejection from me to the clubhouse even though i dont have the same locker i didnt want to see it to be honest it was a very bad moment
4913409 but for the most part i feel comfortable in this uniform
4913410 there were some feelings i havent felt in awhile but i was excited
4913411 hes going to be there the thing is can the other players get the job done to help brett along
4913412 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4913413 im a 94 overall i think thats the biggest year to year ratings jump in madden history
4913414 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as somewhat loving
4913415 im very ticked if you really want to know the truth
4913416 they might as well be moving to outer new jersey so he doesnt care hes got no attachment out here i cant imagine driving by here next summer and not seeing them
4913417 all the great players that walked through the same door
4913418 he was the same old brett very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work

4913428 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4913429 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4913430 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4913431 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4913432 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4913433 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4913434 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4913435 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4913436 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4913437 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4913438 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4913439 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4913440 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4913441 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4913442 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4913443 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4913444 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4913445 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4913446 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4913447 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4913448 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4913449 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4913450 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4913451 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4913452 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4913453 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4913454 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4913455 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4913456 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4913457 this is a planning took where all things are going
4913458 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4913459 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4913460 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4913461 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4913462 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4913463 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4913464 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4913465 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4913466 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4913467 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4913468 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4913469 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4913470 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4913471 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4913472 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4913473 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4913474 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4913475 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4913476 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4913477 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4913478 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4913479 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4913480 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4913481 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4913482 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4913483 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4913484 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4913485 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4913486 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4913487 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4913488 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4913489 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4913490 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4913491 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4913492 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4913493 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4913494 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4913495 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4913496 virtualization for dummies sun and amd special edition is now available
4913497 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4913498 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4913499 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4913500 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4913501 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4913502 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4913503 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4913504 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4913505 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4913506 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4913507 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4913508 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4913509 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4913510 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4913511 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4913512 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money

4913780 beloved brethren in moses we have received your letter in which you tell us of the anxieties and misfortunes which you are enduring we are pierced by as great pain to hear it as yourselves
4913781 the advice of the grand satraps and rabbis is the following
4913782 1 as for what you say that the king of spain obliges you to become christian do it since you cannot do otherwise
4913783 2 as for what you say about the command to despoil you of your property make your sons merchants that they may despoil little by little the christians of theirs
4913784 3 as for what you say about making attempts on your lives make your sons doctors and apothecaries that they may take away christians lives
4913785 4 as for what you say of their destroying your synagogues make your sons canons and clerics in order that they may destroy their churches
4913786 5 as for the many other vexations you complain of arrange that your sons become advocates and lawyers and see that they always mix in affairs of state that by putting christians under your yoke you may dominate the world and be avenged on them
4913787 6 do not swerve from this order that we give you because you will find by experience that humiliated as you are you will reach the actuality of power
4913788 what id like to do is talk to health and human services to get information thats going to help resolve this
4913789 if true this is particularly disturbing because the legislation specifically and unequivocally states whether or not the department has established an infection reporting system hospitals shall begin to submit reports as required by this section within six months of the effective date of this section
4913790 to prevent hospitals from rationalizing any failure to file reports based upon administrative inaction i also note that this provision of the law required the first reports to be filed not later than dec 31 2007
4913791 i am requesting that you advise me and the oversight committee which hospitals if any have filed reports and when
4913792 this is something we know is an issue we know its important to legislators and clearly we havent done it but we continue to make the effort in order to get this done
4913793 money is always a help to be sure but in this case im not sure its the biggest factor
4913794 there are so many different variables having the data out there without a framework how is the public and others going to be able to read the information
4913795 we spent a lot of time with lawmakers talking about the hospital infection reporting law my own experience in the legislature is that sometimes legislators think they can make something happen just by passing a law even if it is something that cant happen
4913796 hospitals are perfectly happy to report whatever the state wants somebody has to tell them what the rules are what are the criteria and definitions
4913797 we told the hospitals as soon as the state delivers the criteria rules and system they will comply until then they cant do it its not as if they are stonewalling this thing
4913798 the centers for disease control and prevention apparently feels there are sufficient protocols
4913799 there are some experts in this field who say protocols are available to be utilized
4913800 im happy to hear toumpas is on the case i hope more hospitals can get with it quicker

4913817 independent thinkers are analytical and witty persons they are normally self confident and do not let themselves get worked up by conflicts and criticism they are very much aware of their own strengths and have no doubts about their abilities people of this personality type are often very successful in their career as they have both competence and purposefulness independent thinkers are excellent strategists logic systematics and theoretical considerations are their world they are eager for knowledge and always endeavour to expand and perfect their knowledge in any area which is interesting for them abstract thinking comes naturally to them scientists and computer specialists are often of this type independent thinkers are specialists in their area the development of their ideas and visions is important to them they love being as flexible as possible and ideally of being able to work alone because they often find it a strain having to make their complex trains of thought understandable to other people independent thinkers cannot stand routine once they consider an idea to be good it is difficult to make them give it up they pursue the implementation of that idea obstinately and persistently also in the face of external opposition independent thinkers are not the type who easily comes out of his shell speaking about their emotional life is also not one of their strong points anyway social relationships are not particularly important to them they are happy with just a few close friends who find it easy to share their intellectual world they find it difficult to establish new ties in love they need a lot of space and independence but this does not mean that their partner is not important to them independent thinkers often make a cool and reserved impression on others but this impression is deceptive they can hardly bear it if people close to them should reject them they prefer a harmonious balanced relationship with a partner who shares their interests and with whom they can realise their visions adjectives which describe your type introverted theoretical logical planning rational independent intellectual self confident analytical structured dogged witty resolute self critical visionary inventive independent unsociable reserved nonconformist quiet visionary honest demanding hardworking

4913826 this is a totally different media and you can do so many things you cant do in a newspaper with animation and interactivity and sound
4913827 the goal is to entertain people but also to engage them with a not so subtle propaganda message
4913828 i would love to be an investigative journalist or a writer

4913835 i can tell you every one of these guardsmen is proud to go i dont think youll be able to talk to anyone who will tell you theyre not prepared for this mission
4913836 i never expected to be here again for another deployment ceremony
4913837 its kinda hard and its kinda tough for her for me to leave this will be my second tour but i told her just be strong i just got to do it to help out with my country
4913838 its more different now because were married the first time he got deployed we just started going out so now its kinda different responsibility i guess
4913839 so really nervous about this and scared i was crying earlier when they were cheering
4913840 im not nervous this time but i feel much comfortable leading my team
4913841 im trying to spend as much time with him as i can and then you know pray for him
4913842 biggest impact are on the families those who are left behind need to get through the childcare on their own now without their husband or wife or if son or daughter mother or father
4913843 as we found out last year a lot of this settles itself
4913844 they deferred a lot because he was the big dog
4913845 it makes it a little more difficult this season hopefully we can find ways to make all of them happy
4913846 theres no such thing as one back anymore in the nfl or in college
4913847 i have no problem with a two to three back system because it gives you weapons to throw at a defense and it makes it easier
4913848 we probably went too far too fast with him and slowed down his comfort level in the games
4913849 once he got settled in you saw what he could do

4913854 poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part
4913855 many commentators of course condemn this drive into an independent country as a manifestation of resurgent russian imperialism this first of all is to somewhat ignore history it also sets aside more than a few cases of wounded russian pride for the most part widely flouted before putin and incidentally not to offend our new european union partners from the east it is a demonstration of the futility and even the toxicity of nato
4913856 eastern europe with fear in the belly of the russian bear has never relied on european integration to ensure its security in their view only the united states could provide that hence their absurd following of the americans into the iraqi adventure hence their irrepressible desire to join nato a grave error on their part because the united states entangled as it is in the iraqi affair and with its allies in afghanistan wont budge for a piece of the former empires confetti georgia and perhaps not even in case of a more serious invasion especially since the new american leaders starting in november are likely to mobilize all their forces on domestic affairs
4913857 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4913858 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4913859 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4913860 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4913861 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4913862 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4913863 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4913864 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilise or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4913865 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4913866 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4913867 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4913868 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4913869 we still see the next few months as being quite rough
4913870 the cycle has turned and the australian dollar likely has more downside ahead of it possibly taking it back to around us0 80
4913871 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4913872 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4913873 love is not about the words for example les am ricaines they say i love you all the time they say it to the people they dont even know so much but it means nothing love is about the little things you do every day in the time you have together
4913874 it is much more specific than anything in the past
4913875 mechanical breathing or circulation through cpr and ventilation was all that was previously addressed the molst form covers feeding issues antibiotics comfort measures aggressive treatment and non aggressive treatment
4913876 it sounds perhaps frivolous but its a very serious thing
4913877 the event is more of an invitation to a revolution more than a party in a sense until we come out of the closet and let people know our numbers politicians think they can ignore us
4913878 this is showing those who arent religious that there are other social groups im not going to pretend im religious so i can be part of a group
4913879 theyre making a decision that theres life without god and were concerned about it
4913880 the de baptism doesnt have any magical or supernatural aspect
4913881 do you agree that the magical potency of todays ceremony is exactly equal to the magical efficacy of ceremonial baptism with dihydrogen monoxide and do you agree that the power of all magical ceremonies is nonexistent
4913882 for a minute there were just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that

4913884 the jineng doesnt have a narrow entrance anymore its all five start hotel standard king size beds the newest flat lcd screen television and even indoor jacuzzis that are todays elements of the jineng interior the air circulation is operated by ac to make it comfy for all season
4913885 most tourist prefers to stay in the jineng rather than in the other rooms
4913886 the development of materials and the trends of design do not close to the possibility of this structure getting a new look both to in fa ade and its interior
4913887 i have been working here for 25 years and its been renovated several time since i first arrived
4913888 the architect should work with the operator in enriching the concept so that it can reach an optimal performance not only followed the trend it is expansive to maintain the jineng
4913889 thats the way you like to see an offence execute
4913890 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4913891 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4913892 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the us and so it was difficult to refuse
4913893 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
4913894 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4913895 we received the order from the special investigation unit around 9 20 pm last night 1320 gmt saturday saying former president chen was barred from leaving the country
4913896 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4913897 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4913898 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4913899 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4913900 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies

4913907 there was no violence such as gagging threatening or hitting the child
4913908 we are put on this earth to have a good time this makes other people feel good and the cycle continues
4913909 mobile phone adult movie channels have all the different genres some major adult productions normally on sale in the marketplace have also been reformatted to suit mobile phones
4913910 these options are becoming really popular mainly among salarymen who want to be able to watch these movies without their families finding out
4913911 thats true but even so adult movie makers are setting up sites for docomo users one after the other and mobile phone av is on the verge of becoming an everyday service
4913912 some adult movie production companies have mobile phone site links on their official sites if you check these out it greatly reduces the risk of getting caught up in a scam

4913927 coach says its all about heart and real players come to play
4913928 its all about guys knowing their assignments and trusting each other we gave up 60 points but our offense is on fire we had a few big stops and then the offense took advantage so it takes stress off the defense

4913943 a college with which i am affiliated discovered that its alma mater was written for a blackface minstrel show in the 1900s although the lyrics are innocuous the school banned the song from this years graduation and formed a group to discuss its future use part of a campaign to make students aware of things they take for granted is this a good response or should the school focus on more important issues is it unethical to sing the song
4913944 the schools response is not only ethical but also admirable
4913945 the athena factor reversing the brain drain in science engineering and technology
4913946 dedicated to promoting policies that enable individuals to realize their full potential across the divides of gender race and class
4913947 once and for all we must recognize that the heart and soul of discrimination the last refuge of the bigot is to say that those who are discriminated against deserve it because they are less good
4913948 started to collect evidence that their male peers had received a disproportionate heres that word again share of laboratory space and resources for research
4913949 arise from particular religious and political strains remote from western experience
4913950 illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces
4913951 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
4913952 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
4913953 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
4913954 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
4913955 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
4913956 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
4913957 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
4913958 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
4913959 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
4913960 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
4913961 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
4913962 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
4913963 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
4913964 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
4913965 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
4913966 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
4913967 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
4913968 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
4913969 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
4913970 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
4913971 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
4913972 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
4913973 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
4913974 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
4913975 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
4913976 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
4913977 it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads
4913978 at first truman was almost alone in thinking that an airlift would work as an effective response to the soviets

4913980 the tour of world capitals and hot spots represented a test that was necessary to pass it looks as if hes done far better than just passing hes aced this tour if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
4913981 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes

4913985 he initially said some of the students were being harassed
4913986 i asked you to voluntarily remove your video from youtube because you had no authority to publish it i explained that you needed to obtain for starters the students consent before doing so
4913987 as a result of a third party notification by claremont graduate university claiming that this material is infringing
4913988 i dont see any legal basis to request student faces to be blurred based on the facts as i understand them
4913989 the web site i paid for it to be up for a year
4913990 i didnt want all the art to pile up on me
4913991 the knowledge of individuals taken as a whole is far greater than that of any commission or board however diligent and expert the magic of the system of prices and of economic markets is that they incorporate a great deal of diffuse knowledge
4913992 a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action
4913993 it looks as if hes done far better than just passing
4913994 if there was any doubt of his stature on the world stage i think hes more than answered that he hasnt put a foot wrong in any of these places
4913995 i didnt take it lightly that a high priced lawyer who has represented celebrities like cameron diaz and lou rawls was hired by officials at a university with unlimited spending power to make my life miserable i had no idea to what lengths claremont graduate university would go to jerk around a little guy exercising his first amendment rights
4913996 claremont officials had enough appreciation for free speech to allow an armenian genocide denier to speak as an honored guest at their university but when it came to news coverage of the event which is protected by the untied states constitution they seemingly concocted a reason to squash free speech i can only assume the phone call from a lawyer was a not too subtle effort to shut me up
4913997 theres nothing in any of these data that would suggest that girls cant do math or arent doing well in math
4913998 the claremont port side has changed drastically over the past year
4913999 the magazine has undergone a complete redesign from an expanded and professional looking website including

4914014 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through

4914028 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4914029 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4914030 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4914031 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4914032 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4914033 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4914034 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never see these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4914035 you only get one life angela you need to choose your battles wisely some things just arent worth it you know
4914036 i dont care what they do as long as they leave me out of it
4914037 it was a hard fought season and that no 1 car myers is awfully tough
4914038 winning this race just topped off a great season for us
4914039 seven wins nine poles and a seventh championship thats definitely the best yet
4914040 burt had me slowed down and junior caught me and gave me a shot in the corner
4914041 he got up to my door and i was thinking ok well be third and win the points
4914042 when junior spun burt i just cut left and went by them
4914043 then i was thinking hey weve got a shot to win a race and the championship
4914044 nascar is going to review the situation were going to talk about penalties in the coming week
4914045 thats why i try not to get into those peeing matches because it hurts you at the worst time
4914046 i think burt probably lost his cool and run into junior down there but you get caught up in the heat of the moment and thats what happens im just glad we stayed out of trouble won the race and won our seventh championship
4914047 we didnt have the best car by any means but we kept the hammer down and did the best we could
4914048 you see 5 over par winning u s opens and 7 or 8 over making cuts something is wrong
4914049 thats fine every once in a while we need a vegas and a buick open where guys shoot 20 under par and people are talking about he birdied four in a row thats what were supposed to do the nba players are supposed to dunk the big hitters are supposed to hit it out of the park and were supposed to make birdies
4914050 we need the hilton heads to play short and tricky and we need oakland hills to play long and tough but we need variety and not putting for par every week
4914051 if jesus were on earth today would he support a womans right to choose abortion
4914052 for anyone to presume to speak for jesus would be well kind of presumptuous
4914053 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement
4914054 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4914055 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4914056 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4914057 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4914058 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4914059 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4914060 i want to wear it all the time but i dont want to look like an idiot
4914061 i dont want to go out there and make any mistakes i dont want to look like an idiot my biggest goal is to just be smooth and gain as much respect as i can
4914062 we focus on everything from how internal communication is how people are doing their jobs
4914063 if making a change was going to fix it then there might have been changes but thats not the issue
4914064 i think steve letarte is doing an awesome job its just been one of those years i believe in what we have theres areas where were looking to getting stronger and better the fans have to just be patient and i remind everybody of what we did last year
4914065 we were an awesome race team last year had one of the best years that ive ever had
4914066 and steve was the guy that was guiding that ship so i believe 100 percent in him
4914067 in stock usually ships in 1 to 2 business days
4914068 im not mad im replaced we dont do anything anymore and all you do is hang out with your new friends
4914069 well while you were dating your last girlfriend and i asked to hang out you would say if she didnt want too
4914070 well if you thought a little harder id hang out with you more than her
4914071 the school called you have a two hour delay today
4914072 im not going to be home im hanging out with
4914073 well my birthday is tomorrow but that doesnt really mean anything anymore i guess
4914074 youre not old enough to think that yet are you
4914075 well no i guess not i have to work tonight and early monday morning so i cant really do anything
4914076 whatever the shape of the company moving forward there is little doubt that the retention of the mtn brand and culture would be two of the most important aspects executive management and shareholders should ensure
4914077 provide investors customers and the people of both companies a global platform for exponential growth
4914078 reliance communications is smaller than mtn and lacks the financial muscle for a takeover but it is not going to want to be a subsidiary either
4914079 if mtn is looking to remain listed on the johannesburg stock exchange and remain a south african company and be the aggressor in this deals having this sort of exclusivity says to everyone else you guys dont approach us dont bother we are not looking to be acquired
4914080 both countries are still posting double digit revenue growth in their native currencies which converted in us dollars creates a big spike in worldwide carrier revenue as well
4914081 its something im just going to have to play with
4914082 it may not be 100 percent for a while but you play
4914083 thats the main thing but im starting to feel improvement
4914084 doc is pitching like a hall of famer pitches hes being doing that for a few years
4914085 i pitch with a fast tempo and i know halladay does too
4914086 i know the games going to go fast if the guy i hook up with is the same way i like to get my team on and off the field even if i give up runs i dont want to do it in 30 pitches and i dont want our team out on the field for 30 minutes
4914087 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
4914088 how did their life become so adorably sweet how come they still can manage to laugh and play around despite a busy stressful life
4914089 whew i got a point today im glad i gave it a shot
4914090 geez i didnt even hit a score today i wish i had the guts to try out we could have won
4914091 most of us know that laughter is the best medicine to lifes aches and pain but most of us dont know that the best kind of laughter is laughter over self coz then you dont just become happy you become free
4914092 im not happy that we lost i never am but i saw some things out there that made me feel i would be a very good fit for this team
4914093 he pretty much controlled up the whole night and thats why hes one of the best in the league
4914094 halladay threw a great game and youve got to tip your hat
4914095 it isnt just duke it isnt everybody and it isnt just individuals making this disaster
4914096 baldwins column ignited a faculty firestorm political science professor kerry l haynie codirector of the center for study of race ethnicity and gender in the social sciences sic sent a nasty email implicitly challenging baldwin to settle their disagreement by violence
4914097 the postmodernist rag political identity and the vernacular in the bulk of what the authors write in reference to me are larger lies distortions innuendo incomplete references or references stripped of the context that made them quite different from what they report and often those things are in fact the opposite of what is implied or described
4914098 overwhelmingly african american audience spoke of the rape as an established fact
4914099 in lubianos mind the players could never be cleared no matter what the evidence
4914100 she expressed pleasure that the duke administration is getting the point
4914101 demand for perfect evidence on the part of the defenders of the team
4914102 lubiano looking forward to the day when well all get together after the revolutions over promised to run to the barricades to save her job at least if the university adopted policies that she opposed
4914103 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4914104 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4914105 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4914106 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4914107 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4914108 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4914109 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4914110 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
4914111 its bad enough with everything thats going on in this world
4914112 first it was people killing people adults now its adults doing it to children
4914113 i dont know how i would feel if it was one of my children
4914114 its just really messed up the situation that went down
4914115 but what she cannot do is betray the message in order adapt it to society
4914116 the truth is always the truth there are some things that cannot change because they are things man has received revealed by god in jesus christ
4914117 history and the present moment must adapt to the truth and not vice versa
4914118 unfortunately israel at 60 remains a country under threat threatened by those groups and regimes who deny to this day its right to exist
4914119 and why look beyond the thinly veiled rationalizations because they hate israel just as they hate the jewish people
4914120 my fear is what i see happening in some circles is anti israeli sentiment really just as a thinly disguised veil for good old fashioned anti semitism
4914121 some elements in our political system even some members of parliament
4914122 theres a very close association between being anti israel and being anti semitic i dont think its fair to say that everybody who has or expresses concerns about israeli foreign policy is anti semitic
4914123 if that were true three quarters of the population of israel would be anti semitic
4914124 do you expect from these greater numbers that they will absorb themselves into canadian society as canadians or that theyll try to push canadians to adopt their own values and principles
4914125 ive got nothing against the fact that muslims are members of the canadian parliament but it worries me that the type of political influence that were seeing in britain in france might ultimately reach the canadian political system
4914126 canadas policy on the middle east should be debated on its own merits without resorting to obnoxious statements about the demographics of one or another religious or ethnic community i wonder what the response would be if an ambassador to canada from any one of several arab states were to express concern about the impact of jewish canadians on canadas middle east policy
4914127 i talked to coach boynton a couple of days ago
4914128 south carolina is still up there in the mix they will most likely be in my top five theyve been loyal to me and they are just a good school
4914129 ive tried cutting the list down but schools keep contacting me and offering me so that makes it hard
4914130 i am glad you will be here in the fall you can accompany me to the stars games

4914133 i wouldnt come back from that type of surgery right now
4914134 i know it is not going to get better by just resting so i need to fix it to enjoy the rest of my life
4914135 when i was growing up nasa united americans to a common purpose and inspired the world with accomplishments we are still proud of today nasa is an organization that impacts many facets of american life i believe nasa needs an inspirational vision for the 21st century my vision will build on the great goals set forth in recent years to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and ensure the fulfillment of nasas mission together we can ensure that nasa again reflects all that is best about our country and continue our nations preeminence in space
4914136 human spaceflight is important to americas political economic technological and scientific leadership barack obama will support renewed human exploration beyond low earth orbit he endorses the goal of sending human missions to the moon by 2020 as a precursor in an orderly progression to missions to more distant destinations including mars
4914137 he had taken a shot on me and almost scored but i put him in a leg cradle so i scored two points and the match was over
4914138 martinez is going to challenge for a job and weve got a couple of other kids in the minors and theyre not going to give up either
4914139 weve got a lot to look forward to and get some players out of the kings system
4914140 the pace is a lot quicker the guys are smarter and more skilled
4914141 theres a lot less running around when you get more skilled guys and smarter guys they know their position and they play it well
4914142 its great to be out there the guys are so good and youre surrounded by great players its definitely a faster pace and its more fun
4914143 im 6 1 about 213 right now ive grown a little bit and ive gotten stronger
4914144 youve got to build your strength and your speed as well were working with the strength and conditioning staff and theyre doing a great job
4914145 theres guys in the nhl who are stronger now than when they started their careers and thats only benefitted them
4914146 you can improve your deception picking your head up a little earlier surveying the ice to get better vision theres definitely room for improvement
4914147 the great players are great because they do all the little things well
4914148 a lot of guys are skilled a lot of guys can move the puck but if you can do the little things well thats the difference between good and great
4914149 theyre talking to the defense as a whole and were working on the little things every day the deception being positionally sound
4914150 hockey is all about the next play if you catch yourself out of position the other team the skilled guys and the smart guys are going to capitalize
4914151 players my age tend to drift a little bit too much thats one thing were working on staying between the dots as a defenseman if youre the right position everyone else in the zone is reading off you and everyone else tends to be in the right position
4914152 i dont think you can really look at that stuff too much
4914153 if you look at that and get focused on it it can get the best of you all im trying to do is go out there get better every day and when training camp comes along see what happens
4914154 the belief in the inevitability of peace and democracy rested on one of the great conceits of the european enlightenment namely the belief in the perfectibility of man
4914155 the great constant in mans affairs is change the direction of that change is determined by human actions and many of the men and women who take those determinant actions are evil machiavelli is not the only sage who recognized it but he put it nicely
4914156 man is more inclined to do evil than to do good

4914173 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
4914174 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
4914175 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
4914176 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
4914177 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4914178 when shes not there i get flutterflies feel like i just ate a ton of atomic bombs and think that i might blow up
4914179 those first formidable years are the ones when being separated affects them the most
4914180 if you can keep them together for those years then the twins can fit in with the school and feel more at ease
4914181 i had already accepted the fact that they were going to be separated
4914182 the point is that separating them can have adverse effects and does in many cases
4914183 theyre focused on the other and constantly thinking about them
4914184 there are a lot of things in the school system that are antiquated and should be changed the laws are old outdated and dont make a lot of sense
4914185 most of the time parents dont want their kids together we just think they blossom a bit better by themselves and make new friends
4914186 i just wondered why they needed to make a law
4914187 i have no idea what was behind this or why
4914188 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years thats a good thing
4914189 when i stepped on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
4914190 theres not too much fun in training camp offseason workout and things like that to me the most important thing is playing i knew id made the right decision when i was on the field tonight
4914191 i feel like im a jet i do its still a little bit awkward but i feel like im here for a reason i told the guys im here to help them win
4914192 seven practices or whatever it was and he moved the ball effectively
4914193 the other thing that he does really well is the play fake and the things that that opened up like the reverse his presence puts pressure on the defense because theres always the opportunity for the deep ball
4914194 i had numerous people on the redskins team say it almost dont look right
4914195 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok ten days ago i was doing yard work i ran and threw a little bit with the kids at the high school but theres no substitute for what we did tonight
4914196 my arm feels great ive been throwing the ball well i feel once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok im more concerned about terminology and getting plays out and protection changes
4914197 most of those passes were passes you should complete anyway so i dont want to make it sound like there were some passes that are mid season form passes but considering what i was doing 10 days ago im pretty pleased to get the ball in the end zone
4914198 i wanted to get this game over with and just get on it was positive anxiety positive nervousness its better than not having any feeling at all i was excited about it
4914199 im just one piece of this puzzle at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not one person
4914200 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
4914201 the only result of the use of air strikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism if the international community focuses on the terrorists bases hideouts and places where they are being trained and financed the problem is going to solved
4914202 i cannot foresee a winning outcome in afghanistan without resolving the sanctuaries in the tribal areas of pakistan
4914203 i cant see a viable level of afghan government authority developing here while there are still all these militant sanctuaries across the border
4914204 the initiative does not provide the most appropriate measure of cancer care and has serious flaws particularly in the damage it has done to clinical audit of treatment and outcome the pressures on audit staff are excessive

4914313 we would plan and find the resources to do it
4914314 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
4914315 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around

4914323 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4914324 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life

4914330 every time i do something i see the kids six months eight months later and theyre still talking about it
4914331 i came here before i went home from school i got a lot of whoopings then but my mom is proud of me now
4914332 its just a thing me and my best friend came up with
4914333 we always preach taking one step closer to your dream
4914334 without him i really dont think it would be like it is right now

4914336 seeing the kids happy and having a good time thats the highlight for me

4914341 perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation

4914343 the campus itself has more people than my hometown im really more of a big city girl at heart

4914348 when i was standing on the podium at manchester it was like winning a gold medal at the olympic games
4914349 ive only ever won one medal during my career before so to win one after everything ive been through is just incredible
4914350 every time i race its like my personal battle with me and a way of finding out what i can get out of my body
4914351 i couldnt walk 50 metres without feeling out of breath i was completely exhausted there were some days i struggled to get up
4914352 i started losing my memory i couldnt retain any information if i read something i wouldnt be able to tell you what it was about i was really dizzy and suffering from severe exhaustion
4914353 it was just a relief to be told it was me because at least i knew what it was you start imagining all sorts
4914354 when i had to have a brain scan i was so scared that there might be something there
4914355 as for the athletics i thought that was the end of it i was 99 9 per cent certain in my own mind that i would never run again but it was really the last thing on my mind as my health was at stake
4914356 i felt so numb that really it didnt matter if i ever ran again
4914357 you look fine on the outside but inside you just feel dead the nickname yuppie flu left the condition with a stigma
4914358 i was so low and terribly depressed as i couldnt do anything i had nothing to look forward to
4914359 athletics had been my life but i was basically sitting around the house all day
4914360 i would walk into town with my mum who would put me on a seat in the middle of town while she did her shopping she would then come back for me and we would catch a bus home that was the most i ever did
4914361 she was an incredible lady who i was very close to and its terrible to see someone you love dying it was very distressing and just about sent me over the edge
4914362 after her death i went to her house to help sort out her belongings and i found a load of clippings from the cumberland news and the news amp star on my athletics career she was so proud of me and i just felt that i couldnt let my athletics go i felt i owed it to her
4914363 when i was at my worst i could never have imagined ever getting a medal no chance
4914364 if i hadnt been the sort of determined character that i am i would have been in bed all day
4914365 i cant give up no matter how much is thrown at me it makes me more determined
4914366 athletics has kept me going if it wasnt for that i dont know where i would be im going to try to step things up and try to set a new pb in the 100m
4914367 if feel terrible for what ive put my parents through as i love them to bits its not just me suffering its them too as well and i know my illness has an impact on them without them i would be nothing
4914368 everything i do is an effort some days im just so tired that i cant make an effort so i only train when im up to it and i dont set training schedules
4914369 if i go down to the sheepmount i think ive beaten me today i might be physically shattered afterwards but mentally i feel better

4914455 no mom i didnt forget i just you know dont care about easter all that much thats all
4914456 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
4914457 whether it was making fun of each other or clowning on raymundo somehow everyone found a way to make fun of mosley
4914458 the veterans me lalo hanz we clowned him on him everyday but he took it like a champ
4914459 what he was doing with the ball i dont know but you got two legitimate scorers who are capable of hitting those clutch shots
4914460 sometimes its about knowing your role and playing your cards right
4914461 he was feelin it that day and he had to take that shot
4914462 we have more than 1 example on that theory all im sayin is isnt basketball a team sport
4914463 i know ive playing horrible no d no o no heart im about to step up my game and bring my teams to playoff contention
4914464 so im stuck in vegas and im looking for a flight out
4914465 it would be easy for me to just drive but im here with my peeps
4914466 on them during the ldr considering the sources i got these stories from i took it with a grain of salt
4914467 where are those secrets now that youre too scared to tell
4914468 if our soldiers can make sacrifices on our behalf we are also willing to be patient until such time the terrorists are completely wiped out from this country that is the day that we can hope for true peace and harmony among all citizens we have suffered enough at the hands of ltte
4914469 what the man to my right accomplished is the biggest thing in sports general its bigger than the tour de france its bigger than a pressure putt at the u s open
4914470 im at a loss for words this was everything that i wanted to do and everything i dreamed of its an amazing feeling
4914471 oh yeah i said yesterday i welcome any comments all they do is fire me up i love when people say that somebody cant do something you want to go out there and prove it that much more
4914472 since hitting a peak in the summer of 2007 the illegal population may have declined by 11 percent through may of 2008
4914473 it seems that increased enforcement is at least partly responsible for this decline
4914474 the census bureau does not produce estimates or counts of illegal immigrants living in the united states
4914475 the persuasiveness of cis argument is undermined not only by an absence of hard data but by the faulty logic and contradictory statements of the report itself
4914476 the authors report confidently about a population that is nearly impossible to accurately measure
4914477 undocumented migration clearly responds to changing u s economic conditions with steep increases in the flow toward the end of expansion phases of the business cycle and significant decreases during economic downturns
4914478 there is no evidence of an exodus either because of economic conditions or greater enforcement
4914479 several demographers who specialize in estimating the illegal immigrant population expressed concern about the limits of the studys methodology but said they found the possibility that the illegal immigrant population is decreasing plausible determining the actual amount of that decline however is a far more controversial matter
4914480 that does not support the argument that people are leaving but rather that people here are spending less money because of economic conditions and future plans
4914481 while it is clear that a large share of illegal aliens are included in census bureau surveys there is always the question of those who are missed although dhs as well as most researchers assume a 10 percent undercount there is debate about the number of illegal immigrants who are not counted
4914482 the center for immigration studies cis has a history of misrepresenting facts concerning immigrants and latinos
4914483 dad i get the chills when we talk about the ways in which the world works and you describe to me your ideas and views and then you take it one step further and say isnt that how you respond to life zach
4914484 its different i think only in that it has evolved from record to record
4914485 i mean from the beatles to soundgarden not one thing they did sounded like the last thing they did this new ep will sound nothing like invitation karma crash
4914486 its been a long road to get to this recording so much has happened since the last record we finally got to a spot where we narrowed 15 or 16 songs down to five and just said its time we recorded it ourselves which is a first for us but to our surprise it sounds like we paid good money for it go figure it will be called either eyeballs and meatballs or face down on jackson avenue probably the latter it will be released in a couple of months
4914487 and because we produced this one ourselves we got to experiment in extremities during the recording process
4914488 we had the time to hook things up the wrong way take instruments through equipment theyre not supposed to go through do something completely wrong just to see if it sounds cool and that type of thing i think weve done some bitchin things sonically
4914489 we have been doing this thing for like seven years now
4914490 first they ignore you then they ridicule you then they fight you then you win

4914492 geschleust werden wir sind gespannt aber auch skeptisch ob das so funktioniert
4914493 one day when i was walking through the forest searching for mandrake and the rare mushroom of everlasting love i happened upon a big book buried deep in the ground
4914494 its an automatic diary i guess that means its up to me to create the story as i go on living
4914495 i realised the book was not merely recounting what i did it was telling me what i should do it was time i left my house and started exploring the world
4914496 i took my story to clark publisher of fine books on the corner of easy street and 23rd
4914497 no sir the flight isnt going to leave until later tonight we need to bus you all to the landing zone after dinner
4914498 well can you just let us out at the gate well find our own way back
4914499 o k how many of you sunni leaders want to get left in the middle of baghdad to find youe way to ramadi instead of flying with an armed escort
4914500 oh well all go and rent a couple of cars
4914501 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4914502 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4914503 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4914504 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4914505 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4914506 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4914507 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4914525 you could see the weight come off their shoulders i think they know that we are physically better than these guys we just werent there mentally tonight
4914526 i believe that this move represents a dangerous precedent of transferring properties in the heart of jerusalem and is in violation of the citys interest since this is not the only property being contested by foreign sources
4914527 it is unclear what the purpose of such a move is how it advances the national interest and strengthens israeli sovereignty in jerusalem and what the government of israel is getting in exchange for such a large and central piece of property in the capital

4914540 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end

4914552 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places
4914553 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4914554 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4914555 back then most people were still branding businesses with dot com quite frankly nearly everyone thought we were wasting our time
4914556 i had to make certain the samoans understood that we looked at the opportunity as a joint relationship that would ultimately benefit their entire nation
4914557 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
4914558 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4914559 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life

4914566 as we found out last year a lot of this settles itself
4914567 they deferred a lot because he was the big dog
4914568 it makes it a little more difficult this season hopefully we can find ways to make all of them happy
4914569 theres no such thing as one back anymore in the nfl or in college
4914570 i have no problem with a two to three back system because it gives you weapons to throw at a defense and it makes it easier
4914571 we probably went too far too fast with him and slowed down his comfort level in the games
4914572 once he got settled in you saw what he could do
4914573 violent crime more crimes against property more insurance fraud more white collar crime more juvenile crime more drug and alcohol related crime more domestic violence and child abuse and more organized crime
4914574 the average experience of all u s manufacturing firms over the last two decades is inconsistent with the simple story that all foreign expansions come at the cost of reduced domestic activity

4914597 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4914598 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4914599 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4914600 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4914601 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4914602 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4914603 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4914604 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4914605 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4914606 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4914607 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4914612 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
4914613 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4914614 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4914615 all of a sudden the door of the cell opened the guard came in he loosened the ropes
4914616 and i was standing outside for my few minutes outside my cell
4914617 he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his handle on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together
4914618 my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
4914619 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4914620 when i find myself taking the wrong step i think a lot of times its because im trying to protect myself instead of do gods work
4914621 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4914622 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4914675 one of the most important jobs of i believe the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches and i think that he has been a little bit too willing and eager to give an administration whether its mine or george bushs more power than i think the constitution originally intended

4914693 if a man sells a house in a walled city he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale during that time he may redeem it
4914694 the levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the levitical towns which they possess

4914713 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4914714 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4914715 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by a government on its own people can be more important than sovereignty itself
4914716 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4914717 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4914718 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4914719 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4914720 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4914721 this is the challenge for politicians and diplomats strategic military hostility and confrontation must remain a thing of the past

4914730 the president has been told that being constitutional bodies both the supreme court as well as the parliament cannot interfere in each others affairs and the apex court cannot impede the latter from impeaching him

4914732 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan and met senior government officials

4914969 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment

4914971 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4914972 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4914973 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4914974 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4914975 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4914976 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4915068 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4915069 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4915070 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips

4915086 the way things are going with the economy worries me
4915087 the cost of food keeps going up but our garden has helped us save 50 a month
4915088 what we get from that is an incredible help for our budget
4915089 when i ran out of space i did some herbs and strawberries in pots on the patio
4915090 the food tastes a lot fresher because you can go out to your garden right before dinner pull carrots and eat them that night

4915110 i think we still did well last year despite the rain and i wanted to come back
4915111 but the crafting business is down a bit people are buying gas for their cars rather than trinkets

4915244 i think the transition to more of a sexual health approach in my view brings the industry further into general public acceptance taking the health approach is a good way to allow the industry to become more acceptable and a move to becoming more widely seen in the high street or shopping mall
4915245 we try and make the website as couple friendly as possible and are finding that more and more female shoppers are spending with us
4915246 with broadband getting faster and faster its certainly going to be the media element of the site
4915247 as a community website as well as a shopping site we like to think people will visit to discuss and read about sexual health tips and ideas rather than just shopping as well as providing products to purchase to enhance peoples sex lives we also provide free information to also enhance peoples experiences in the bedroom
4915248 we have many community features to give new shoppers an insight into the adult world and to show people who may feel the subject is still a little taboo that its ok to explore themselves and their partner and to enhance their love life

4915263 last year there were 60 qbs that started in the regular season
4915264 unless all 60 are better than me i expect that my career in the nfl will continue
4915265 i am not convinced that i would gain anything from having an agent at this point in my career
4915266 when i visited the packers i felt real good about the opportunity to back up aaron rodgers on a good team
4915267 i just sensed that when it was time to negotiate that there were some unresolved issues that kept them from giving me a market value offer i think that the brett favre situation was in the background while they were dealing with me
4915268 i just was not willing to take the vet minimum and no guaranteed roster spot
4915269 fyi i never said i wanted to start in pittsburgh
4915270 i was encouraged by league personnel to contact the vikings during free agency to gauge their interest
4915271 i had a good conversation with coach brad childress and i have no hard feelings toward the organization
4915272 the trade discussions were initiated by the vikings and some teams during the nfl combine
4915273 once that was exposed i merely pushed to be involved in the discussions since i was representing myself i regret that there was a lack of understanding between the team and me
4915274 the situation had all of the ingredients for a perfect storm i needed to get out from under a long term deal that had no guarantees left they needed a commitment from their quarterback to get to town and learn their new system the fact that i was injured and it was recommended that i rehab in a warm climate only complicated the matter
4915275 the ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah the ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah the little one stops to chew some gum i dont remember the rest of the song and they all go marching down to the ground to get out of the rain boom boom boom boom

4915281 you know those signs on the highway that advertise gasoline
4915282 what if we could get our logo on one of those
4915283 wow thats a fantastic idea i cant believe no one ever thought of that before
4915284 we cant get our logo on one of those signs
4915285 well how can you be sure if you dont ask
4915286 because if there was some way that any company could get its logo on any interstate sign it wanted just for asking do you really believe that wed be the first ones to realize that
4915287 okay but what if the company doesnt offer one of those four services
4915288 well sir if youre not that kind of company you cant be on those signs
4915289 is there any other kind of sign along the roadway where i could advertise my business
4915290 of course i told them i was calling on your behalf
4915291 even when the avenue in question is an obvious route to nowhere
4915292 we had a lot of close calls last year and a lot of games could have went either way and some of them didnt go our way
4915293 so were hoping that in a lot of situations the ball will bounce in our favor a little bit and actually hopefully we can control our destiny a little bit more and not hope that it comes down to luck
4915294 but were looking for a much better season we know we have a much better team and if we just control the ball and have a little bit more ball security were going to be a pretty dominant team on offense and defense
4915295 i know that we have improved but as to what scale i dont know
4915296 weve looked pretty pure in all the organized team activities in the offseason communication has been great adjustments have been very well so were playing together very well it just still remains to be seen how much weve improved
4915297 obviously its just his presence as far the pass rush goes
4915298 everybody knows what he can do against the pass and hes proven that in the years before in kansas city i think obviously people are going to be looking for an improved pass defense but theres a lot that goes into it its not just one guy
4915299 we have to shore up a lot of stuff in the back seven and kind of let the guys up front do the work so well see we obviously are very excited for it we cant wait for the season to start and see how well we do
4915300 im not throwing that hard but everything feels good it doesnt hurt at all so everything is fine
4915301 yeah im throwing my pitches throwing my changeups a lot everything im throwing everything right now im throwing 93 94 miles per hour tops and so everything is fine
4915302 im feeling comfortable throwing my pitches and youve just got to take it one by one get ready for my next start i mean its fine i dont get sore at all so everything is good
4915303 hes helping me stay patient and not rush too much
4915304 weve got some really young talented kids and i think weve got some tremendous battles going on
4915305 ryan wynn we think is going to be one of our better offensive linemen as he progresses were playing him at right tackle some now ned tavale is having a good camp along with chris bunders theyre in good competition and dom alford at left tackle has really been a solid player for us so we dont have a whole lot of experience up front but weve got some talented guys that i think are really going to grow together in a very strong way

4915318 in the morning when i kneel in worship before the lover of my soul i worship him with my words with song and in the beauty of stillness and silence i praise him with the psalms of david and with personal psalms that flow from my heart of love i listen for his voice then i get up and walk in the world of relationships with a husband grown children grandchildren and friends
4915319 as i walk through my life i walk differently than i did before i began to understand what worship looks like now i see all my life as an opportunity to bow before my king in worship i can worship as i decorate my house clean it and cook many meals for others i can worship as i travel on planes trains and automobiles as i teach gods word to women i can worship as i speak and write books it has been a true joy to see all my words as worship and all my work as worship i rejoice that i now see my pain as a sacrifice to bow before my lord in worship

4915328 some of our players need to serve tougher some need to be more accurate and some need to miss less
4915329 were going to have competition for jobs we havent had in a while

4915389 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4915390 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4915391 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4915392 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4915393 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4915394 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4915395 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4915396 okay so does everyone else do this weird thing too
4915397 and we shall try you until we test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience
4915398 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into various trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience
4915399 women are like apples on trees the best ones are on the top of the tree the men dont want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and dont want to get hurt instead they just get the rotten apples from the ground that arent so good but easy so the apples at the top think something is wrong with them when in reality they are amazing they just have to wait for the right man to come along the one whos brave enough to climb all the way to the top because they value quality
4915400 if you want to win you have to be at the table
4915401 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4915402 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4915403 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan

4915410 it was a situation this neighborhood has original sidewalks in it
4915411 that can make it extremely difficult to replace because every time you try to replace a piece of sidewalk it starts breaking off

4915413 i know the mayor didnt want to do it you never want to get rid of somebody it just is what it is it just happens sometimes
4915414 its about community its everyones stadium this is the peoples stadium
4915415 i want to say thanks most of all to the workers who made this marvel possible
4915416 indianapolis has worked too hard to attract and hold on to certain conventions and special events some of those meetings were starting to outgrow us and those organizations were turning to other communities that were building new venues
4915417 with todays grand opening were more than back in the game weve moved back to the forefront
4915418 there are a lot of tangible benefits to building this stadium but the real reason is far more significant than any dollars and cents analysis it is because the indianapolis colts bring us together as a city and a state
4915419 indianapolis is already americas leading sports city and this gold medal stadium confirms that
4915420 indy and indiana can be very proud of everything that has been done to make this possible
4915421 evan bayh has had to develop budgets and administer a large state bureacracy which is vastly different from running an office in the united states senate
4915422 during his term in office people of both parties recognized his administrative skills
4915423 he could be stubborn but was a person who over time learned and listened
4915424 the evan bayh that came into office in 1989 left eight years later a much wiser political leader
4915425 i sometimes questioned whether he brushed his teeth without taking a poll
4915426 he had his own organization and his idea was that you guys need me a lot more than i need you and that was so true
4915427 im not using anything as an excuse just inefficient with my pitches ive got to use more of the plate rather than hitting edges

4915432 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
4915433 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing baseball betting workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
4915434 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
4915435 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
4915436 most baseball betting companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
4915437 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
4915438 our baseball betting company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
4915439 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the baseball betting industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously
4915440 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these baseball betting workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
4915441 seven ways to increase productivity in the baseball betting business
4915442 if you tell someone in the baseball betting field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
4915443 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
4915444 normalerweise ignoriere ich solche sachen aber wenn jemand sagt wie oft f lschlicher weise behauptet wurde dass ich meine romantischen beziehungen als pr missbrauche oder um neue filme von mir zu bewerben dann ist das wirklich weit unter der g rtellinie zu lieben und geliebt zu werden ist die sch nste sache die einem menschen passieren kann das eigene leben ist sehr viel wichtiger als all der glamour und ruhm der welt

4915748 they clearly drew a bright line separating themselves on some issues
4915749 but what was distinct here was they did it without smashing each other
4915750 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that but there are ways that we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
4915751 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually

4915783 i triple check and test all our online casino website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works

4915786 if the israelis dont resolve the palestinian prisoners issue soon and contemplate attacking gaza the palestinian resistance is prepared to not only defend the strip but also take the initiative and kidnap more soldiers who will never see the light of day unless a prisoner exchange deal is signed
4915787 bringing about the release of the captive idf soldier and prevent the capture of additional israeli troops
4915788 but they will be carried out should the ceasefire be violated and in case no solution is found to the issue of the palestinian prisoners within the framework of a prisoner swap with israel
4915789 why are the israelis permitted to arms themselves and train and we arent
4915790 we will continue with our jihad and warn that if israel attacks the strip will become a graveyard for idf soldiers
4915791 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizbullah or to kick hizbullah out south of the litani
4915792 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
4915793 so hizbullah is violating 1701 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south also we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
4915794 1701 says clearly no arms south of the litani river no militias south of the litani that is why unifil is here
4915795 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizbullah or to kick hizbullah out south of the litani
4915796 i know they are careful not to challenge unifil and there is practically no visible hizbullah fighter to be seen as far as unifil is concerned this is compliance
4915797 in lebanon everyone has a gun what graziano might have been saying is that nobody carries a gun except the army unifil and hunters in this he would be correct
4915798 but coming around the last corner one of my teammates thought the other guy was yelling to go so he sat up
4915799 when he sat up there was a lull in the sprint and i couldnt make up the gap
4915800 theyre 50 minutes from downtown dallas and its rural and its isolated and i think thats probably the reason that theyve chosen this area
4915801 its a class c misdemeanor which is the same as getting a speeding ticket
4915802 its not what id like to do but we have to work with the laws that the legislatures passed
4915803 it was a special occasion to get the job done and win gold
4915804 yesterday was hard the 4 16 this evening was controlled the final was hard but i couldnt risk trying to race too easily
4915805 i had to play it safe not chased world records
4915806 three other guys in the team deserved to be in this race it was the least i could do for them
4915807 i cant believe it i knew i was going to be thereabouts
4915808 i was pretty emotional before i went out there its a pretty big deal
4915809 three rides at 4 19 a silver medal ive got to be pretty happy
4915810 ive had coaches taking me aside and telling me ive made history now i have at least got the silver
4915811 ive had a smile on my face about that theres no other athlete in the olympic village that can say that
4915812 whatever happens tomorrow sunday its really got nothing to do with who its against its getting my best performance out
4915813 the race was very difficult for the first part only in the second part could i go around the group twice for the gold medal
4915814 i remember all the people who support me at this very moment i remember isaac
4915815 i knew in the penultimate sprint i had no more chance to get gold
4915816 the spanish cyclist had too many points im happy its my first olympics and ive been able to win a medal
4915817 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4915818 who is the man who would risk his neck for his brother man
4915819 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours
4915820 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4915821 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4915822 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4915823 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance
4915824 at that point i didnt really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4915825 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4915826 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4915827 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4915828 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4915829 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4915830 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4915831 maybe it comes around once in a lifetime its almost disbelief to some degree
4915832 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4915833 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4915834 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4915835 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4915836 we were obviously disappointed that we couldnt make the gold medal match but its going to be something really special to us to have that medal back at home
4915837 to win any medal in the olympics is a huge achievement
4915838 not many of the athletes get a chance to win a medal
4915839 i have to take something positive from the way i was playing this week
4915840 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to no 1 that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
4915841 its not the first time this tournament or in my life i had to serve for a big match
4915842 its basically the moment you dream of being in even though there is so much pressure to it
4915843 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4915844 you can make these up to one week in advance
4915845 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4915846 partnering with a leading operator such as o2 is an important step to expanding the opera brand in europe it brings the full internet experience to millions of cell phone users in germany
4915847 we hope to build on our relationship with o2 in the future and use this success to continue to bringing mobile customers across the europe the most complete internet experience on the go
4915848 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4915849 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4915850 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4915851 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4915852 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible
4915853 im making up a new olympic game for elle to take part in in order to succeed you need speed agility helpfulness legs and dignity you also have to be able to chase things that are rolling
4915854 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in love is the only rational act
4915855 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
4915856 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
4915857 you didnt get any photos of the game im disappointed
4915858 if you keep doing this ill stop pirating your shit
4915859 people say oh are you an engineer are you an artist do you do marketing i say yes i do all those things
4915860 they wanted to get some out of the box ideas for medical problems
4915861 we found that malaria is one of the largest problems affecting and killing millions of people
4915862 as they continue to breed they become immune to the insecticide
4915863 when people are sleeping your arm could be touching the net and the mosquito could bite through that net
4915864 by no way was it just me it was a team effort
4915865 i hope to continue to work on a variety of projects
4915866 i went home and googled industrial design and thats how i got on my path
4915867 el secreto de la vida no es hacer lo que nos gusta sino amar lo que hacemos

4915873 im walking 60 miles and youre not sure if you can make it across the street
4915874 i live in a quiet world a solitary place where i sometimes believe i have too much time to think a fantasy realm really where i concoct perfect worlds and perfect words and perfect moments its part of being a writer sometimes i just start talking out a scene in my head holding both sides of the conversation and occasionally i am astonished at what comes out of my mouth a perfect piece of dialogue and i run to my office and pull out a piece of paper and scrawl it down to put into the screenplay later but my life is not a movie i only get to control everyones behavior on the page when my hands leave the keyboard all bets are off people will say things or not say things and i get riled because their words are their own not from the daily script that runs through my head

4915921 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4915922 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life

4915928 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a cold war mentality but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4915929 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad
4915930 while there are actions that we cannot condone russian perceptions exist and will take time to change
4915931 the incomplete passes if you look at the numbers youd say he struggled well there are reasons for things that happened each play he did misfire on a couple of them but he made some good throws

4915937 within a poor mans squalid home i stood the one bare chamber where his work worn wife above the stove and wash tub passed her life next the sty where they slept with all their brood but i saw not that sunless breathless lair the chambers sagging roof and reeking floor the smeared walls broken sash and battered door the foulness and forlornness everywhere i saw a great house with the portals wide upon a banquet room and from without the guests descending in a brilliant line by the stairs statued niches and beside the loveliest of the gemmed and silken rout the poor mans landlord leading down to dine

4915943 also known as the nissan fairlady z is a sports car that was produced by nissan it comprises the third and fourth generations of the z car line up respectively given the chassis designations z31 and z32
4915944 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4915945 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4915946 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
4915947 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4915948 i know there are some here in cal eee fornia that disagree with that position
4915949 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is
4915950 i want to be president because thats the america i believe in and that american dream is slipping way we are at a critical juncture economically we are at a critical juncture internationally our politics is so broken washington is so broken that we cant bring together people of good will to solve these problems
4915951 i think i have the ability to build bridges across racial lines across regional lines and i hope i have the opportunity to do so
4915952 i am pro choice i believe in roe versus wade not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
4915953 i am in favor on limits on late term abortion if there is an exception for the womans health
4915954 most of it turns out to be just error and not deliberate fraud
4915955 the dollar amounts are so small that people get in cash assistance you can spend massive amounts of resources trying to crack down on small sums
4915956 on the other hand it is important to reassure the public that their money is being well spent and that people arent cheating the system
4915957 welfare is a needed program but when people commit crimes its our obligation to go after people who are committing them
4915958 if someones out there frauding lets get them off the program and get someone who needs it on it
4915959 if we find that somebodys frauding they just get shut down
4915960 were trying to save the county and in essence the taxpayer money
4915961 any felony case whether its welfare fraud or any other economic crime if it crosses the felony threshold were going to pursue it
4915962 i think having that designated staff i believe is the reason we may generate more cases
4915963 then we will allow them to do that as a sanction and they wouldnt have a criminal record
4915964 for one thing theyll drag it out in order to continue to get the benefits we dont get quick pleas on these
4915965 the advantage is its quicker and more efficient to move it through the administrative process
4915966 after scouring him over the summer we came to consider him one of the best players in the draft
4915967 his bonus was reflective of that he was too good to let walk without putting our best foot forward
4915968 the only way you can do something like signing the top 16 is with support from ownership
4915969 john henry tom werner and larry lucchino believe in putting money into scouting and player development and they believe in what were doing
4915970 he will do something similar today and maybe stretch it out
4915971 it will depend on how he feels coming in and the level of strength he shows
4915972 a bank robber walks into a bank in order to rob a bank
4915973 some people walk into a welfare office knowing theyre stealing from the welfare office
4915974 but some of them are just out and out bold
4915975 turner acknowledged that he was supposed to report his employment to minnesotacare but stated he could not afford the health care offered by his employer and did not want his family to go without health care benefits
4915976 when some people said its not possible and it cant be done i think thats when my imagination came into play
4915977 and i thought i had a chance to do it coach bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through
4915978 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4915979 hes not from another planet hes from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now hes just an average swimmer but he has come back to this time to mop up
4915980 he is the greatest sportsman ever to walk the planet
4915981 just a normal person but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
4915982 well never really know the answer to questions like that
4915983 but however you rank them michael cant be far down the list
4915984 there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation plus hes a fantastic competitor mentally tough and someone who appears to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
4915985 i hate to compare swimmers to players in the nba or nfl
4915986 but i will say that theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the field
4915987 the idling policy is what were really focusing on right now within a month well have a pretty good policy set up
4915988 itll be easier for me to make decisions on other cars if im stepping away from mine
4915989 if the city must provide a vehicle its going to be the most cost effective cost efficient model possible
4915990 this is an expense the city can no longer afford
4915991 its got some very strong community aspects to it beyond being very economical
4915992 my budgets what it is and i have to make that work
4915993 a bathtub is the only thing youll be able to turn on without hearing norm coleman and al franken attack each other
4915994 define the campaign in a way the other doesnt want to define it
4915995 theres so much negativity im tired of it i want to hear them debate
4915996 those ads are funny not only funny but very novel and creative
4915997 weve decided were running for u s senate why not were just as qualified as al franken and were better bowlers
4915998 instead of paying taxes in the states where franken spoke he overpaid taxes to the state where he lived
4915999 he is responding to coleman which means that coleman is setting the pace
4916000 coleman is being investigated for paying only 600 a month rent to live in a million dollar dc home owned by a washington insider
4916001 this is a picture of the living room al franken put in his tv commercial when he lied about where norm coleman lives
4916002 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4916003 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4916004 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4916005 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4916006 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4916038 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4916039 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class

4916099 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming
4916100 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4916101 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4916102 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4916103 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming
4916104 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4916105 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event

4916109 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4916110 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4916111 jedi fights okay now we need to come up with something to go inbetween them
4916112 the guys on the relay team were amazing these guys made it possible the relays made it possible the whole thing every race from winning by one hundredth of a second yesterday to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill have forever
4916113 i went from hitting my head on the wall to winning by one one hundredth of a second to doing my best time in every event its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster its been nothing but fun
4916114 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4916115 i think the term spitzian feat is a little outdated now
4916116 were going to have to start calling it a phelpsian feat
4916117 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4916118 its been everything from getting my hand on the wall and winning by 01 in the 100 butterfly to winning the 400 free relay by 09 to doing a best time in every event
4916119 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster and its been nothing but fun
4916120 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4916121 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4916122 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4916123 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4916124 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4916125 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
4916126 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
4916127 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
4916128 at the end of every day i go home and cry its such a rollercoaster by the end you are mentally drained the only way to deal with it is to go home and talk it through i just cant switch off
4916129 i talk about the contestants and then the next time people come back i say remember that person i was telling you about well today she buckled you cant help it
4916130 i find it quite overwhelming just to be asked to sit in sharons place
4916131 you cant replace sharon shes a massive character if i was sitting at home id miss sharon as a fan of the show thats one of my main concerns about being on but its not my fault
4916132 i find this whole thing quite insulting for both of us
4916133 i admire dannii in a way and you know shes been around for a long time longer than i have
4916134 i grew up on a council estate in a single parent family so ive had to be tough its in my nature to be tough
4916135 im healthy im happy and im definitely not too thin so its irrelevant really
4916136 the hours are long last week we worked four days solid from ten oclock in the morning until midnight and then im going into the recording studio so its so important for me to be healthy and to have a healthy diet i dont feel pressure to look a certain way but i feel i need to be healthy
4916137 you take on their feelings so one minute you might be laughing your head off because you think theyre crazy the next minute youre really sad because youre breaking their dreams
4916138 i dont feel pressure for myself i want to do the acts some justice
4916139 the music mogul had planned on spreading the hit show across saturday and sunday nights
4916140 but its either live or it isnt and i know that if we had recorded this on a saturday it would get leaked and its not a result any more
4916141 on cheryls first day i saw her shaking and i remembered being like that last year i told her were all here to have fun this is music its what we love doing and its giving that chance to someone else
4916142 and ive never been competitive but while mentoring i found i really wanted to win
4916143 the back to school look is harder like a rockin look
4916144 i think what happens is kids see mom wearing this stuff and then parents think its so cute they start buying it for their children
4916145 i think it started with people liking the look to be original but now everyone wants it because every one else is wearing it
4916146 its not as much color but its detailed with something like a guitar with one pink jewel on it
4916147 it is popular because it holds up is neutral and is easy to care for
4916148 we are selling everything from 165 joes jeans to guess to more moderate jeans
4916149 i think jeans have made a strong comeback because there is a jean for all body types there are jeans with embellishments and those that are flare at the bottom are popular
4916150 the brands that are really popular are dvs lakai and fallen
4916151 its the kids that dont skateboard that want the loud shoes
4916152 i think it has a lot to do with video games and they learn the brands through games
4916153 its really excellent marketing some games let you dress your skater so kids learn the brands
4916154 you even see some of the skater shoes being matched to the bold shirts
4916155 the colors are pretty basic but the material is fantastic and will last
4916156 a lot of our stuff is stretch material so you can wear something underneath or a longer sleeve shirt under a t shirt
4916157 the look is a bit more casual and not so many buttons but stuff that can be worn over other items
4916158 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming
4916159 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4916160 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4916161 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4916162 we are hoping to build an amusement park with international quality rides
4916163 the rides have not changed much over the last decade and there is need to bring something fresh and exciting for children
4916164 klfd is likely to be completed by this december the ring road will be open to public very shortly and be dotted with more than 3 000 trees
4916165 im so sad im so introspective this song makes me cry this quote speaks to me
4916166 be yourself if you care enough to have a personal blog in the first place define yourself as a person rather than a caricature of what youd rather people see or think
4916167 i didnt complete as high of a percentage as i did the week before but i thought my decision making was pretty good
4916168 it is tough to get into a rhythm but thats not an excuse
4916169 normally you have a full game to eventually bounce out of that get a big play and then the momentum switches
4916170 you can be the no 1 defense in the league and you can still have room for improvement
4916171 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4916172 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4916173 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4916174 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4916175 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4916176 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
4916177 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
4916178 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
4916179 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions running through my head so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4916180 our whole country can be proud of him maybe in this era nobody makes us prouder
4916181 there is no comparison in the swimming world for what michael has done
4916182 i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing he is and how special he really is
4916183 the term spitzean feat might be a little outdated it might be phelpsean feat now
4916184 weve got a much smaller surface area to play on and there are a lot more one on one contests
4916185 its a lot harder on the body and in afl they have got more freedom to do what they want in netball you have less time to make a decision and less room to move
4916186 netballers dont get as much recognition as they deserve we need more sponsorship though were getting there
4916187 hes a british citizen vietnam wants him to go back to the uk
4916188 icho hadnt been beaten for a long time so god its so frustrating to lose dugrenier fought so hard to have a 1 1 match against the olympic champion and multiple world champion were so proud of her super proud of her
4916189 its so hard not to have martine in the finals right now
4916190 pemerintah akan melakukan verifikasi berdasarkan hitungan itu dengan nanti minta bpkp atau pihak eksternal auditor itu yang kita selesaikan dulu mekanisme reimbursement kan apakah dia yang lebih bayar atau dia yng kurang bayar
4916191 pajaknya sendiri kan kita tidak tahu yang sudah mereka bayar dengan rezim ppn besar versus rezim ppn kecil implikasinya terhadap keseluruhan laporan keuangan dari perusahaan silakan mereka melakukan penghitungan kembali dari mulai mereka melakukan kontrak sampai sekarang
4916192 kalau lebih bayar harus kita kembalikan dan itu ada di dalam mekanisme anggaran yang kita buat pemerintah punya mekanisme untuk hal hal yang sifatnya kontinjensi seperti itu
4916193 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
4916194 these guys made it possible the relay really made it possible it shows how much teamwork and togetherness we have its amazing to be part of it
4916195 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second yesterday to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience and something ill have forever
4916196 wait i cant remember why i came into this room
4916197 i got thirteen channels of shit on the tv to choose from choose from choose from

4916203 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4916204 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4916205 i bequeath all my beauty to my younger sister joan since she has none
4916206 i think its because im not a bitch maybe thats why miss crawford always plays ladies
4916207 take away the pop eyes the cigarette and those funny clipped words and what have you got
4916208 the best time i ever had with joan crawford was when i pushed her down the stairs
4916209 my senior year in high school i was part of the worlds worst rock band to ever rock the north shore of chicago called collected moss
4916210 i think we had one gig and we did about 10 covers just any of our favourite songs that we could find we just voted whether or not to cover that song or not
4916211 i took four weeks of drum lessons with a drum coach and in the midst of that we watched a lot of heavy metal youtube videos to kind of prepare for that
4916212 i really wanted to be a convincing drummer i didnt want it to be like me faking drumming and then having a drum double i wanted people to see me doing the fill and hitting the cymbal on the beat and stuff life that
4916213 its really hard to be filmed and to have to act a scene in which youre drumming and youre different characters
4916214 so i have to drum as fish and not as rainn then there will be lines in the middle of it or theres a subtext or something going on while im playing and im trying to remember and listen along and play along with the track doing all of that at the same time was incredibly challenging
4916215 peters awesome he has a very sly and subtle sense of humour but he likes silly gags
4916216 he always kept it grounded and real its a pretty absurd piece but it stays enough within the real world to make it identifiable
4916217 i guess the similarity i would have with fish is that we both kind of wear our hearts on our sleeve a lot im actually a much more reserved and cerebral kind of guy fish is much more balls out react first and ask questions later i think thats the way any drummer is
4916218 thats the job of the internet movie reviewer to be kind of snarky
4916219 theyre good but people think of me as dwight and they start asking me dwight questions
4916220 and they get their chance to be with dwight so it kind of becomes a little bit more of that
4916221 do i enjoy watching myself on the big screen no i hate watching myself period
4916222 all i see is ah i should have done that or oh if only the camera was there or if they could see what i did with my hand there i look like a weird bloated ghoul its pretty painful for me
4916223 well i would like to say i slept with hef but i didnt
4916224 but i was thinking about three years ago about playboy bunnies and what happens when its time for the next phase of life for some of these girls that have lived in the playboy mansion how do you re enter the real world
4916225 so i pitched the character to legally blonde writers karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith and they wrote a script and the next thing you know were shooting the l
4916226 i did work out i mean i tried to i did pilates i got some hair extensions wore a lot of padded bras thats the extent of my prep
4916227 i still feel incredibly awkward and you never quite get used to this stuff but im really proud that i made a movie i feel in my movie experience ive definitely had to give up the sense of vanity
4916228 so it was kind of nice to play the pretty girl all of the cast gave up their sense of vanity for the sake of the movie they were all so game and eager to be vulnerable on camera whether it was katharine being pregnant rumer in the neckbrace emma wearing glasses
4916229 but all of them approached it so enthusiastically there wasnt a moment where i had to say cmon just do it for the movie
4916230 everybody was so game and so excited to play the true zeta girls maybe more than they were to be super hot later
4916231 hes been an incredible support system i talked to him yesterday and he really likes the movie he likes the fact that his girls are in it and its thrilling to see him act in a movie
4916232 in character so i was starting to really have a clear vision of who shelley was having said that it was really intimidating i had the feeling i dont belong in this crowd all these girls are really hot and confident and i felt really self conscious for sure
4916233 i thought maybe the studio wouldnt necessarily see me as that and that was intimidating
4916234 shelley yknow shes got a lot of hair and like a lot of makeup we had to do body makeup to make my cleavage look bigger getting into the wardrobe took 20 minutes or so strappin in it was a challenge
4916235 the shoes i loved i kept them all ill still put them on at night and trot around although i wont go anywhere in them i loved wearing those
4916236 i dont think its a stand against being a model
4916237 its more about finding her real family she realizes she doesnt belong in that world anymore but i dont think its necessarily a judgment against that world
4916238 keep your eye out maybe for the september issue i have to be cryptic about these things
4916239 maybe its just because i feel so good right now at this time in my life i dont know but it has been very cathartic
4916240 this most recent show i did outsiders inn is the most fun ive ever had in show business however i have to say it isnt really reality its more of a hybrid which im excited about because its mainly improv so i felt like i was acting again
4916241 totally absolutely because id probably weigh 500 pounds you know
4916242 im 5 foot 3 im always up and down i love to eat but i just feel best when im at a slim weight i get to a place sometimes in my life where i dont exercise im an all or nothing girl i get into things all the way and then ill just back off all the way
4916243 i was afraid of saying certain things and answering certain questions

4916332 obviously i still have a bitter taste im not pleased with what happened that first inning

4916341 and we inted to cater to this need with newly designed courses
4916342 the only reason we took this online casinos case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
4916343 im excited to be litigating this online casinos case with my colleague santa kandt a distinguished attorney with more than 25 years experience
4916344 and we firmly believe that the online casinos case we have prepared for the 3 judge tribunal is rock solid
4916345 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the online casinos case is argued
4916346 with students working hard on their online casinos law mid term exams ive been able to assist the grisso illsley and erminia huxley law team in the recent online casinos class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances
4916347 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss kanoa paulik was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision
4916348 were working closely with the lead partners at the soder wolinski and deena vandevender law firm to develop our new online casinos law curriculum
4916349 in hopes to provide real world insight for our studies that will prepare students adequately for the future
4916350 im really happy with the verdict in the recent online casinos case which was argued by my mentors eckart heupel and estrada juncker who work at the prestigious kindig hohnstein inc law firm downtown

4916357 maureen bader b c director of the canadian taxpayers federation agreed
4916358 if one government raises its public sector salaries because another government does without taking into consideration taxpayers ability to fund these increases it has the potential to spiral completely out of control
4916359 first we had the 30 per cent pay increase for members of the provincial legislature then a variety of municipal pay increases and now huge senior level bureaucrat pay increases we are on a dangerous trajectory with no end in sight
4916360 dont state it if you dont want me to investigate it
4916361 once again it turns out that the real decisions in this organization are being made between berlin and paris
4916362 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable
4916363 historical experience but also from the interests of corporations that think they will make a lot of money in russia
4916364 hi im deaf but i can read lips and id like to talk to you

4916369 earlier some neurosurgeries used to take up to 20 hours per surgery because of which neurosurgeons were known to work by the calendar
4916370 the role of laparoscopic surgery in the removal of rectum compared to the traditional method is tremendous as the postoperative complications are less
4916371 we are still in the infancy when it comes to minimal invasive surgeries
4916372 but what she cannot do is betray the message in order adapt it to society
4916373 the truth is always the truth there are some things that cannot change because they are things man has received revealed by god in jesus christ

4916385 the way things are going with the economy worries me
4916386 the cost of food keeps going up but our garden has helped us save 50 a month
4916387 what we get from that is an incredible help for our budget
4916388 when i ran out of space i did some herbs and strawberries in pots on the patio
4916389 the food tastes a lot fresher because you can go out to your garden right before dinner pull carrots and eat them that night
4916390 i didnt want to bend because i am compromised with back and neck issues
4916391 large containers dont require as much watering so they are less wear and tear on the grower
4916392 im putting up soups ill freeze things in bags because they lay flat and stack better
4916393 we decided to cut corners and make it through by putting in our own garden
4916394 two pepper plants yielded six to 10 bell peppers thirty radish seeds gave us 30 radishes the leaf lettuce is the best thing we did we havent had to buy it once
4916395 the garden needs one inch of water once a week
4916396 i recommend having two gauges one to measure rainfall and the other to register your watering
4916397 he was a year older than me but i ran with him from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1999
4916398 when i heard that he made the olympic team i made arrangements for a hotel airplane ticket and tickets to his event one other track event and several mens basketball games
4916399 i thought it would be cool to see someone i ran with starting in the fifth grade compete in the olympics and ive never been to china so i thought why not
4916400 i havent seen him since the spring of 1999 and have only talked to him on facebook
4916401 but i discovered that i am better at poker than i was at running
4916402 i am a spontaneous person i like to do a lot of unusual things and since i am a poker player i dont have to report to anyone
4916403 so my friends are not at all surprised that i decided to go to china for eight or nine days to watch jorge run in the olympics
4916404 it has been an effort of the whole parish and the culmination of six or seven years of work
4916405 we have a growing community a committed group of parents and a whole group of parishioners enthusiastic about a grade school everything came together at the right time
4916406 now a whole new group will have christ at the center of all of their classes
4916407 it will help parents raise their children in the faith and it is a statement of hope in the future batavia is a vibrant city and its an opportunity to say that we want to be a part of that
4916408 its been a blessing to be able to meet all the parents
4916409 there are so many things going on in the park people will be stopping here
4916410 having the show for two days will make a change i see the show growing it makes a real difference when you dont have to pack up after just one day
4916411 i think we still did well last year despite the rain and i wanted to come back
4916412 but the crafting business is down a bit people are buying gas for their cars rather than trinkets
4916413 we have to make sure he doesnt overexert himself so he can heal properly
4916414 jackson will be well taken care of at our home
4916415 we have a fenced in backyard baskets of toys treats and another boston terrier for him to play with he will have everything that he needs
4916416 we all hope that jackson continues to progress in his recuperation and that he has a long happy and healthy dog life
4916417 i liked having the opportunity of being able to sample the different theater companies in town
4916418 the next two saturdays theres going to be more artists out here
4916419 this is great were getting a lot of positive feedback
4916420 its a very different feel from what im normally used to but it gets us actors closer to the audience
4916421 you can interact more it really enhanced the experience for myself and the audience as well
4916422 its good on a lot of levels it gets people downtown the plays are the right length
4916423 we thought wouldnt it be nice if every kid in hanover park marched with their team or organization and if theyre not marching then they have plenty of options to choose from to get involved
4916424 weve been practicing our parade show at band camp but this is our first real parade this year and were ready to go
4916425 it gave them a wonderful foundation while building their confidence and boosting their self esteem and yet a lot of children dont have this
4916426 weve got a really young community and yet with seven school districts and no high school in the village were looking for ways to come together
4916427 this is one way for us to look ahead and stay progressive about our future
4916428 i live in a log house with a cathedral ceiling
4916429 ive been to the sale ever since they started here many years ago
4916430 last year we got rained out we still did well
4916431 hes leaving oct 2 from what i understand i have mixed feelings hes here to serve our country as a mother its hard its difficult your child leaving
4916432 youre the latest band of brothers miles away from home making this happen in the best way you can
4916433 you and they represent the finest qualities of our sons and daughters
4916434 troop c 2nd squadron 106th calvary was reactivated in november 2005 during the past three years charlie troop has successfully completed the transition from a light infantry company to a dismounted reconnaissance cavalry troop this will mark the first deployment of c troop proper since world war ii during which the 106th participated in all major european campaigns from normandy to austria
4916435 it had the most students and stories i was interested in
4916436 it wasnt necessarily the town itself or the school itself i was looking for subjects that would surprise me people who seemed one way but had attributes that were unexpected i was also looking for students with strong story lines people who wanted to achieve something during their senior year despite what ever odds there were
4916437 its one thing to agree to be the subject of a movie
4916438 its still another thing to actually have your life filmed i think the toughest part is being able to capture those raw and intimate and spontaneous moments and not miss them and to make these teenagers comfortable on camera and let them bring you into their lives and tell you whats happening so you dont miss things
4916439 and when you see students listening on one end of the conversation youre seeing reaction shots from other phone calls we just cut to a shot of them listening but the audio is all real
4916440 i felt that the inner lives of teenagers are very important
4916441 there is a lot of fantasy and wishful thinking going on at that age normally in documentaries the only way to express that is through the talking head describing it i wanted to visualize what they were feeling and thinking because its a fantasy or in some cases a nightmare the only way to do that i felt was through animation
4916442 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4916443 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4916444 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4916445 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4916446 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4916447 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4916448 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4916449 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4916450 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4916451 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4916452 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4916453 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4916454 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4916455 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4916456 all he talked about was his family and this city
4916457 the canal is not going to be the panacea for new york but it is part of the equation for the upstate economy
4916458 on our first trip in 1990 the locks were strictly commercial and it was really rough
4916459 some people would buy big bales of hay and tie them to the side of their boats to keep the boat from being swallowed up by the big holes in the canal wall
4916460 but it has improved considerably now there are barbecues picnic tables theres tie ups i cant believe how beautiful it is
4916461 we all know the history and significance of the erie canal but its really no longer a transportation facility
4916462 new yorks port is no longer dependent on the river system at all and you can only really justify public investment going forward not because something has a history
4916463 why should the people of new york subsidize yacht owners
4916464 obviously its important to the state for tourism and we dont want to see anything happen to the canal
4916465 but we dont think it should be maintained with money from thruway tolls
4916466 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4916467 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4916468 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4916469 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4916470 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4916471 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4916472 i just finished watching the night of bliss canada now via the internet
4916473 el juicio m s largo de la historia de venezuela
4916474 he is one of the best football players in the world
4916475 the whole team had a great performace in the match we won the game because of the endeavour of the team
4916476 i like messi even though hes on the other team
4916477 when he gets the ball he is unbelievable argentina are better than brazil they have a modern passing game
4916478 he came to meet the whole team on saturday afternoon he was very kind and cheered everyone up encouraged everyone and he told me how to play in this match like not to make long passes
4916479 ill meet him later to talk about the brazil game
4916480 the team is always hard working but also has some very good qualities
4916481 most importantly we all want to achieve something we won by giving 100 percent it was really hard but everyone had a lot of belief during the game even with a player being sent off early on
4916482 tactically we were very sound and we took our chances

4916503 when i heard that he made the olympic team i made arrangements for a hotel airplane ticket and tickets to his event one other track event and several mens basketball games
4916504 i thought it would be cool to see someone i ran with starting in the fifth grade compete in the olympics and ive never been to china so i thought why not
4916505 i havent seen him since the spring of 1999 and have only talked to him on facebook
4916506 but i discovered that i am better at poker than i was at running
4916507 i am a spontaneous person i like to do a lot of unusual things and since i am a poker player i dont have to report to anyone

4916509 the way things are going with the economy worries me
4916510 the cost of food keeps going up but our garden has helped us save 50 a month
4916511 what we get from that is an incredible help for our budget
4916512 when i ran out of space i did some herbs and strawberries in pots on the patio
4916513 the food tastes a lot fresher because you can go out to your garden right before dinner pull carrots and eat them that night
4916514 i didnt want to bend because i am compromised with back and neck issues
4916515 large containers dont require as much watering so they are less wear and tear on the grower

4916523 it gave them a wonderful foundation while building their confidence and boosting their self esteem and yet a lot of children dont have this
4916524 weve got a really young community and yet with seven school districts and no high school in the village were looking for ways to come together
4916525 this is one way for us to look ahead and stay progressive about our future
4916526 because the soil is already warm they tend to germinate faster and take off faster rather than in the spring when the soil is cool

4916575 terry has made it easy for me far easier than most of my patients not necessarily with his own self awareness which to be honest is nothing special but with his candor and total willingness to answer without pause or detour any question i put to him actually he may be the most straightforward patient ive ever had in my life i would like to say at this point you have done a tremendous job in raising a truly honest and open person
4916576 oh dont get the wrong idea hes crazy as a coconut but open
4916577 no mans life is a mystery believe me there is order and structure in the most ostensibly chaotic skull there seem to be tow major events in terrys life that have shaped him more than any others the first i would not have believed had i not unwavering faith in his honesty

4916586 the fact that a cluster bomb can kill more people than a pistol at one go is irrelevant since the death of one innocent victim as as heinous as the death of a hundred unless you have some means of deciding the relative intrinsic worth of individual human lives

4916600 august something in your eyes or was it that july told me not to take it to heart someday we will meet beyond the stars and it will be away from here
4916601 oh if thats what the problem is i know i can handle that
4916602 if things get too bad i can always kill myself or go crazy or get myself put away in a hospital prison or mental institution
4916603 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us
4916604 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me
4916605 no big deal surely it cant always be like this
4916606 oh my i didnt know it was going to be that much
4916607 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4916608 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4916609 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4916610 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4916611 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4916612 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4916613 we dont know what exactly they are going to do
4916614 so my first resolution for next year is to rediscover my writing touch and whip this blog back into shape
4916615 hes someone who will say lets go lets get this done
4916616 weve been a status quo city for a long time so having a fresh perspective is good
4916617 he has an extremely disrespectful way of talking to people
4916618 before we make any change i try to give the residents input
4916619 when they dont like what were thinking about doing im not too proud to change my mind im not too proud to apologize
4916620 we hadnt had the leadership we needed in that department
4916621 theres no magic parks trigonometry you need to understand to run the department its just about people and cooper knew how to lead people
4916622 my concern with mr cooper is his pell mell approach to adding things to our parks without consulting council
4916623 case in point is the bmx track paintball activities and cage fighting at woodward park while i eventually supported the bmx facility i was not pleased how he just did it without discussion with council
4916624 that bill probably has no chance at all of going through this year because congress is in a total deadlock
4916625 we cant even vote on an energy bill how are we going to pass a bill for the judges
4916626 if there is such a label as border courts surely the eastern district of california qualifies as a prison court
4916627 and ive got some people hurt we cant play everybody here in this hot weather in august especially in places like atlanta where you play a doubleheader and then here
4916628 you better rotate your team we dont want to be empty after labor day so weve got to keep our team and fresh
4916629 it was good i take a lot of positives from todays game
4916630 i know i hadnt had a start in awhile i felt like i still had command of most of my pitches the leadoff home run put them on the board early thats kind of a disappointment but overall a lot of positives from my aspect
4916631 he put some good at bats against me a leadoff home run and a double on a good curveball down
4916632 he was seeing the ball pretty well off me i figured i had a good chance of getting ross out i made a good pitch it looked like he was looking for that pitch and just muscled it over the second baseman
4916633 i had a shot there and didnt get it done we had some other shots it just didnt work out
4916634 i dont know how they did it but it was beautiful naigambo said of the marathon conditions
4916635 my foot has been sore for the past week kastor 35 told a reporter
4916636 i thought it was just tendons they get hyper sensitive leading up to a marathon i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
4916637 i was hoping to pull them back said russell who was 27th in 2 33 13

4916639 he had a high position and the power to save her he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
4916640 we all knew he was the only man friend of kim soo im he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4916641 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4916642 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4916643 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4916644 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4916645 came to her begging her to save her my mother
4916646 a very gentle kind of soul honest in his own way a very anticommunist and conservative christian
4916647 i just needed to be with someone who was in the courtroom with her
4916648 if youre looking to make good money in the online casinos field you need an internet presence and a great website

4916650 including hipster faves like legacy brewings pyschedelic ale and magic hats hocus pocus
4916651 im sorry but these prices are a sham knowing the disastrous state of the economy in russia right now if a cup of ordinary coffee cost 10 they wouldnt be making coffee in russia because nobody can afford to drink it
4916652 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4916653 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4916654 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4916655 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy

4916660 this isnt the type of thing that has been sprung on us there has been a lot of discussions for years
4916661 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4916662 this is the oldest identification of fingerprints by post mortem remains
4916663 one is bush and the antipathy towards him the second is iraq and the antipathy towards the war and the third is obama who has attracted a fervor that is very unusual in our politics
4916664 he kind of rolled his eyes and goes i am not waiting for the sheriff to get here
4916665 thats when i jumped in the back of the truck
4916666 we just recently had cameras put in because we had so many drive offs
4916667 the other beautiful part is we got the man and hopefully hell never do it again
4916668 one is bush and the antipathy towards him the second is iraq and the antipathy towards the war and the third is obama who has attracted a fervor that is very unusual in our politics
4916669 an intelligent woman with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned

4916680 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4916681 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4916682 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4916683 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4916693 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4916694 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4916695 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4916696 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4916697 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4916698 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4916699 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4916700 saudi arabias rulers follow the strict wahhabi interpretation of sunni islam according to an iga policy paper released last june saudi clerics have released fatwas effectively banning women from sports by banning sports centers for women
4916701 a lot of the women were depressed and this just lifts them up it gives them a sense of meaning and belonging
4916702 we are not asking for something against our culture or our religion
4916703 all of the arab and muslim countries around the world have women competing and a few years ago we had the bahraini 100m runner who ran in her veil these people should realise we can compete within our religious and cultural framework
4916704 iranian women still battle restrictions but three in headscarves will compete in rowing taekwondo and archery
4916705 muslims who take a more relaxed view of muslim taking part in sports sometimes point to the example of mohammed one of the hadiths or traditional writings and saying about the prophet says that he ran a race with one of his wives aisha aisha who was much younger than mohammed won the race but some years later after she gained some weight they had a rematch and he won according to the hadith narrated by abu dawood
4916706 the ioc said nothing short of a public announcement made in the newspapers and on the radio renouncing all racial discrimination in sport would be acceptable
4916707 of the iocs 110 members 16 are women and only one serves on the powerful 15 member executive board a sizable majority of the 205 national olympic committees have executive bodies that are at least 80 per cent male and only two of the 35 olympic sports federations have women as presidents
4916708 congresswomen delauro is a very big advocate of encouraging women in sports at all levels
4916709 when young women get involved in sports it has a profound effect in their studies their interaction with friends and others and in their future success and careers
4916710 other countries have overcome the challenges if applied sensitively we know it can be done
4916711 sarah mouwad was appointed to a senior position in the college football league in riyadh i hope to make a dent in the saudi sports scene in whatever way i can she recently told al riyadh newspaper

4916715 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4916716 it bit me and i know it bit coop because a lot of people probably thought that i should have been pulled
4916717 he stuck with me and im glad he did i told him to stick with me as long as possible because of the bullpen situation so im glad he showed a lot of confidence in me to try to face that one more hitter and it just didnt happen
4916718 friday we had to cover a lot of innings from a bullpen standpoint
4916719 the only real long guy was geoff geary with tim byrdak being down and chris sampson is down those guys probably need a couple days to bounce back they both threw 50 pitches or pretty close to 50 40 i think and 48 or something like that friday
4916720 i didnt have a pitch to throw inside on anybody righthanded or lefthanded it was ball 1 ball 2 its tough to pitch like that
4916721 i said i really need you to get this guy he said im ok i can do it thats why i left him in
4916722 the worst thing that could happen with cooper asking me to get through this one more hitter ultimately happened
4916723 i take all the blame he doesnt get blame for leaving me in
4916724 not getting chase davidson in an astro uniform to say the least is disappointing
4916725 i can honestly say that as a scouting staff and organization we made every effort on our part to get this deal done
4916726 this happens to be part of the risk of drafting an 18 year old high school player as well as every negotiation having its unique dynamics we met both the pre draft and adjusted post draft demands of the family but came up empty in our attempt as it became obvious that there was a change of heart of where they wanted their next stop in chases baseball career to start
4916727 in the 13 years of being involved in selecting players with the intent of signing the player on draft day this is the first player i have been involved with that has not signed the only silver lining to this outcome is the compensation pick that we will receive in the 2009 draft and i am very confident we will find and sign a prospect of similar value to sign 16 of our first 17 selections is a tribute to the due diligence of our area scouts and supervisors as well as the commitment of our front office and owner we will get past this and continue to push forward in our quest to continue adding quality talent to our system
4916728 hes a tremendous player and not having him in there is definitely something not good for our lineup but going to third base is natural to me ive always loved playing third
4916729 its actually an easier position than first base and thats something a lot of people dont realize at third you dont quite have all the moving around as you do at first base first base is far more physical
4916730 that all star game could be a part of it
4916731 but the fact is i have thrown a lot of innings and if all that happens is i have to be pushed back a few days i dont see that as a major issue
4916732 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4916733 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely there is no easy answer we knew the game was going to be played to its completion
4916734 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4916735 for example ryan is from st louis st louis it seems likes to support their team theyre encouraging

4916742 the ad calls on people to support the freedom to marry
4916743 in the midst of an initiative campaign this kind of call to action advocacy should be seen as lobbying against the current initiative
4916744 is untethered to any political moment election year political decision or vote it is all about asking people how they would feel if they or their loved ones couldnt marry who they love
4916745 the ad helps educate voters so they can make up their own minds

4916761 this program has the ability to improve the lives of everyday iraqi children and save u s lives at the same time
4916762 building security and eliminating safe havens for militia and insurgents
4916763 it was one of the things he could do with kids anywhere once you are on a soccer field it didnt matter
4916764 this is such a simple idea but it has already done so much
4916765 so much of the connection with daniel in iraq has been operation soccer ball
4916766 it makes the experience not as scary very uplifting energizing and hopeful
4916767 in turn the people will keep me and my guys safe in the long run
4916768 this has done wonders for my nephew and for my family
4916769 this has been a blessing this has kept us in touch with him and it has kept my sister focused on something other than the violence
4916770 he sent photos back with the kids holding the balls

4916794 i think its a little sweeter knowing ive been through some injuries and some doubters
4916795 but honestly i think it just made me so much stronger and made me the person i am today its been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4916796 she has a tiger inside her she was very strong today
4916797 i knew i really didnt have much of a chance
4916798 at that point i didnt really care where i placed i just wanted to finish my olympic experience with the best routine i could i wanted to represent the united states
4916799 i wasnt thinking about whether i was going to make it or not
4916800 i was thinking about how i was going to make it thats something that my dad has always taught me go in being so confident that you know youre going to make it and then just do the little corrections as you go
4916801 its an instant group of friends and a way to connect them quickly to the city
4916802 that first job in a strange city is challenging the housing situation gives you someone to talk to about what youre experiencing
4916803 for a crew of guinea pigs as good a group as we could have had
4916804 theyve been fantastic matt and tim seem to have a knack for picking exciting people who are genuinely interested in philadelphia theres a wonderful feel to these fellows theyre not just about adding another line to their resumes
4916805 the community feeling is a big part of what we do
4916806 he had a fearlessness a gutsiness you dont see in many people
4916807 um i really dont have a lot of experience ive been here a couple of years but i havent had a lot of experience
4916808 id rather have a group of inexperienced athletes who are talented than an experienced group that wasnt talented
4916809 im really excited about this young group of talent theyre young and theyve got a lot of things to offer weve been through this drill before a number of years ago when we were forced to play a lot of young guys early but they were much like this they were very athletic
4916810 all played at a young age back there and they grew up fast
4916811 curtis and chykie have come a long way and theyre doing really well and aaron williams is doing a good job so thats really helping our competition with deon beasley and ryan palmer
4916812 right now those five guys all of them have a chance to play we have to figure out how we play them how we substitute and what does that mean
4916813 if a guy is good enough to play then its our job to make sure that we dont disrupt our starting team and dont disrupt the chemistry of guys playing together
4916814 were really inexperienced with our safeties and weve got to find somebody fast earl is a guy who likes to play hes very passionate and hell hit you
4916815 weve just got to make sure we give them enough to be competitive with the other teams and give us a chance to win and not too much to overload young safeties really none of them have any experience
4916816 its exciting because all of us are young with the exception of ryan palmer whos playing great right now
4916817 were all young we have two or three years together so its going to be interesting not only for this year but for the upcoming years also

4916824 a strong link to the city was possible because of its strategic location between ahmedabad and surat also no bombs were planted in vadodara despite it being an important centre in the state made us believe that it was either used as a safe house or base
4916825 their interrogation revealed a lot of information including the fact that the city was being used as a centre for simi operations since about six months before the blasts safdar nagori had visited the city on three to four occasions and the mastermind of the blasts mufti abdul bashar kasmi nabbed from azamgadh had also made visits to the city
4916826 it seems that the plates were made in vadodara but we are still working on the leads and would not like to disclose details at this stage

4916829 the chips used generally by electric and computer engineers were armed by a written programme we believe that the programming went awry which prevented the bombs from exploding we have decoded the program but it is premature to say anything about the contents

4916836 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4916837 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4916838 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots

4916847 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
4916848 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
4916849 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
4916850 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view

4916862 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4916863 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4916864 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4916875 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo

4916877 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

4916879 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4916880 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4916881 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4916882 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4916883 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4916884 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4916885 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4916886 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4916887 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4916888 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

4916941 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4916942 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4916943 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4916944 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4916945 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4916946 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4916947 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4916948 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4916949 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4916950 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4916951 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4916952 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4916953 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4916954 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4916955 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4916956 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered

4916958 el uso de enzimas para la s ntesis qu mica comenz hace unos veinte a os y hoy est muy difundido en el mundo porque entre otras ventajas se pueden volver a utilizar varias veces y cuando hay que desecharlas como son biodegradables no resultan contaminantes
4916959 se utilizan proteasas y lipasas en formulaciones de jabones y detergentes para eliminar manchas rebeldes de grasa celulasas para reemplazar la piedra p mez en el stone washed de los jeans o lactasa para degradar la lactosa lo que es imprescindible para las personas que no pueden digerir esa az car de la leche
4916960 las enzimas ofrecen varias ventajas son muy selectivas biodegradables tienen un costo moderado y pueden funcionar a temperatura ambiente o a niveles no mayores de 50 grados

4916999 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4917000 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4917001 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4917002 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4917003 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4917004 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4917005 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4917006 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4917007 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4917008 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4917009 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4917010 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4917011 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4917015 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4917016 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4917017 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4917018 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4917019 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4917020 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4917021 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4917022 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4917023 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4917024 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4917025 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4917026 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4917027 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4917028 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4917029 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4917030 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4917031 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4917032 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4917033 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4917034 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4917035 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4917036 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4917037 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4917038 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4917039 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4917040 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4917041 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4917042 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4917043 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4917044 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4917045 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4917046 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4917047 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4917048 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4917049 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4917050 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4917051 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4917052 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4917053 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4917054 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4917055 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4917056 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4917057 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4917058 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4917064 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4917065 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4917073 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people
4917074 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
4917075 for years and years seeing place in the world that were being totally destroyed and people that were being totally destroyed by other people and governments i thought theres nothing that i could do
4917076 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangulated by israel and no one is even listening i cant sit outside of this and just let it happen we as human beings have an obligation to stand up and i cant be passive about it you cant stand up in london and just say that you dont agree we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone

4917112 an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all
4917113 this has been good but not as psychological as i expected
4917114 its nice research for physicists to explore but the reality
4917115 extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4917116 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4917117 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit
4917118 theyre real even both of them are doing a good job theyre both better but nobody has taken the no 2 job yet read more
4917119 they have said that they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well
4917120 its good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help
4917121 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4917122 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4917123 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4917124 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4917125 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4917126 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4917127 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4917128 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4917129 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4917133 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4917134 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4917135 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4917136 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4917137 we had a great showing against the defending big west champions
4917138 were ahead of schedule compared to where we were at this time last year
4917139 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4917140 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4917141 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4917142 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4917143 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4917144 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4917145 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4917146 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4917147 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4917148 i serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life i am prepared to give my life in their defense if captured i will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy i will never forget i am an american fighting man responsible for my actions and dedicated to the principles which made my country free i will trust in my god and in the united states of america
4917149 attendance at chapel is part of a cadets training no cadet will be exempted each cadet will receive religious training in one of the three particular faiths protestant catholic or jewish
4917150 all midshipmen except those on authorized outside church parties shall attend sunday services in the chapel
4917151 the commander in chief enjoins the observance of the sabbath the sacred rights of christian soldiers and sailors a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a christian people demand that sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity
4917152 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
4917153 generally speaking we can say that temperature does affect crime
4917154 i feel like i just have better games against them i dont know why because theyre a tough team ill take it its always good to win here in oakland we havent done that over the last few years
4917155 it was a struggle to say the least i was 1 pitch away from every inning except for the sixth from having them blow the thing wide open id like it to be a little bit easier next time out
4917156 every time we come here you always think something is going to happen in a negative way and weve got to try to not think that way or say weve got to do this or that
4917157 its an ugly game but we won it i dont know how we did it
4917158 maybe every time everybody comes here get ready to be killed they made a couple of plays in the last couple of innings to make it interesting but our pitching staff and our bullpen did a tremendous job to hold those guys
4917159 we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when youre not scoring every run becomes crucial if we get 1 or 2 more runs wed get a few more wins
4917160 were trying to win every game so its the same intensity
4917161 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

4917168 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4917169 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4917170 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4917171 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4917172 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4917173 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4917174 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4917175 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4917176 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4917177 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4917178 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4917179 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4917180 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4917181 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4917182 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4917183 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4917184 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4917185 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4917186 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4917187 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4917188 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4917189 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4917190 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4917191 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4917192 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4917193 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4917194 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4917195 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4917196 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4917197 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4917198 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4917199 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4917200 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4917201 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4917202 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4917203 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4917204 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4917205 who are open to doing something on the production side
4917206 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4917207 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4917208 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4917209 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4917210 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4917211 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4917212 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4917213 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4917214 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4917215 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4917216 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4917217 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4917218 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4917219 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4917220 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4917221 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4917222 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4917223 in the true spirit of amateur athletics all who witnessed this amazing feat will surely be moved to donate to the ministrys coffers

4917225 anak muda dengarlah pahitnya kehidupan adalah layaknya segenggam garam tak lebih dan tak kurang jumlah dan rasa pahit itu adalah sama dan memang akan tetap sama tapi kepahitan yang kita rasakan akan sangat tergantung dari wadah yang kita miliki kepahitan itu akan didasarkan dari perasaan tempat kita meletakkan segalanya itu semua akan tergantung pada hati kita jadi saat kamu merasakan kepahitan dan kegagalan dalam hidup hanya ada satu hal yang bisa kamu lakukan lapangkanlah dadamu menerima semuanya luaskanlah hatimu untuk menampung setiap kepahitan itu
4917226 hatimu adalah wadah itu perasaanmu adalah tempat itu kalbumu adalah tempat kamu menampung segalanya jadi jangan jadikan hatimu itu seperti gelas buatlah laksana telaga yang mampu meredam setiap kepahitan dan merubahnya menjadi kesegaran dan kebahagiaan
4917227 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4917228 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4917229 we are tied together in the single garment of destiny caught in an inescapable network of mutuality and whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly for some strange reason i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be and you can never be what you ought to be until i am what i ought to be this is the way gods universe is made this is the way it is structured
4917230 the pseudo occultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorizing and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision all such worthless rubbish is not worth the power and shot of argument in order to form a just estimate of the sacred science we must study originals and try to penetrate the minds of the great mystics whose works bear evidence of first hand knowledge of the supersensible worlds
4917231 it is through your body that you realize you are a spark of divinity
4917232 for most of us however we only think seriously of food or sex or money when it becomes a problem which is to say when we feel we are not getting our share when we find ourselves in that situation then i regret to say that meditational visualisations are really not the best way to remedy the lack we are here in a physical condition in a physical world and while in that state we have to abide by the laws appropriate to it
4917233 the biblical texts have been strained out through a greek latin mindset which is very surface and static
4917234 the imprisoned titans underneath the soil grinding writhing take your strength from them throw aside your petty drawing room point of view
4917235 there are some forms of religion that are bad just as theres bad cooking or bad art or bad sex you have bad religion too
4917236 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4917237 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4917238 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4917239 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4917240 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4917241 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4917242 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

4917248 i would look at steven and i was like i have to defend myself but i always had my oldest brother to take care of me
4917249 to see steven there supporting us just shows what a great person he is
4917250 he always adds on to what jean has to say and it really empowers us
4917251 always no matter what sport no matter what game all of the time
4917252 and steven sets that bar again a simple fun volleyball game turns into this competitive

4917257 we select students in early elementary school who are low income and have academic promise leadership potential and committed family support it is amazingly successful people are blown away when they see it
4917258 my mom was incredibly smart and had the highest level of dignity concerning work
4917259 i tell my players that you need to learn to love the process that theres a dignity to work it helps you and your self esteem i cite things that she did for me all the time with my team
4917260 theres an incredible strength from being with those children and their families
4917261 incredible stories occur all the time at duke childrens hospital even if a youngster is not able to go on with life how the hospital helps celebrate and dignify the life of those youngsters and families is amazing
4917262 you know to those who are given much much is expected
4917263 ive been fortunate to be given much and i understand that you should do something with that its very humbling knowing you have the opportunity to do that you better do it

4917300 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4917301 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4917302 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4917303 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4917304 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4917305 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4917306 siamo di fronte ad un vero e proprio accanimento personale nei confronti di chi si occupa di sicurezza dicono i lavoratori intervistati de angelis infatti nel 2006 aveva subito
4917307 il licenziamento era arrivato dopo la denuncia sulla mancanza di sicurezza andata in onda sulla puntata di
4917308 al termine della procedura prevista dallo statuto dei lavoratori e dal contratto collettivo nazionale delle attivit ferroviarie
4917309 non stato motivato per avere diffuso notizie sull episodio del 14 luglio peraltro ampiamente noto quanto piuttosto per avere reso dichiarazioni contrarie alla verit infondate e pretestuose sia sulle cause che sugli effetti dellepisodio stesso
4917310 un licenziamento in pieno ferragosto gi un fatto anomalo ha commentato il sottosegretario ai beni culturali francesco giro pdl ma a ci si aggiunge anche la gravit della denuncia se fondata de angelis meriterebbe una medaglia non un licenziamento mi unisco alla richiesta dellassemblea nazionale dei ferrovieri venga revocato il senza indugio lallontanamento del macchinista
4917311 thats what ive been telling him since last year when he got knocked out that one time
4917312 but hes making plays you cant ask him to do too much more but i think sliding is going to be a major focus now for him it takes a while to realize how important it is versus maybe that 1 yard you might get out of making that guy miss or something
4917313 for 10 years now you could set your watch on the men who play a couple of rounds of pool after breakfast
4917314 with fun activities being a very important part of the structure at autumn glen it seems a few of the ladies competitive nature has resurfaced theyve been practicing every day after lunch and if my guess is correct theyll be challenging the men to a tournament in the very near future
4917315 we engage the residents in everything from morning stretch exercises to chair volleyball games wii bowling and lasso golf and cooking classes to name a few
4917316 also newly introduced to the residents at autumn glen is the brain gym a specialized series of mental gymnastic programs tailored to our residents
4917317 we have some very special people here at autumn glen and some great activities to spark the interest of just about everyone
4917318 i drove the standard car in wales a couple of years ago and it was just awful it was like being entangled in a duvet on a hot night i hated it
4917319 the sense of community and belonging that noelle helped to provide for the hearing impaired scout is immeasurable
4917320 noelle continued to host the classes for the children and eventually taught the kids how to sign and sing songs like love me do by the beatles she understands that language opens doors to so many other things such as tolerance understanding communication friendships and peace of mind truly helping to make the world a better place
4917321 depending on how you look at the forecast and depending on whether or not we can actually meet the challenges at hand the forecast is at best partly sunny
4917322 we hope that its not a catalog of things that have been done so much as a series of ideas about what we could do what could be done
4917323 if we are to meet the challenges that we face i believe what is required are governmental led initiatives that are matched by and propelled by a kind of bottom up grass roots movement
4917324 i dont think you can have one without the other
4917325 ive never curated a show of this scale nor one where we expected this kind of audience
4917326 families have to work harder to find lenders than in years past
4917327 this year i was denied flat out by about 12 lenders
4917328 i was super excited for it and now i have to switch gears and try something new
4917329 we just take a look at what products we offer consider the environment were currently in and that was the decision that was made
4917330 sallie mae always encourages student or parent borrowers to apply for private loans with a credit worthy cosigner who can help them qualify for the best available rates and fees
4917331 it is not required of course but we always encourage it whether a student is a new customer or a return student looking for continued help
4917332 were seeing a lot of students who were planning to go to other universities and colleges but money is not available to them
4917333 would have to pay a higher interest rate but could still get money
4917334 maybe due to the economy and due to costs going up overall financial aid is not keeping pace with the rising cost
4917335 so a lot more families are applying for financial aid
4917336 weve had an increase in questions about financing but there hasnt been a huge jump in the number of financial aid applications
4917337 our choices have been reduced but we still have many lenders out there who are very willing to lend to our students
4917338 weve always been here to support the kids thats what its all about
4917339 weve been sponsoring sports teams and youth activities since day one
4917340 times are getting tougher for everyone and were feeling the crunch as a nonprofit organization
4917341 but that doesnt mean we can stop doing what we do there are people out there who need us
4917342 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
4917343 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
4917344 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
4917345 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
4917346 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
4917347 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
4917348 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
4917349 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
4917350 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
4917351 you go to your room shut the door and dont come out
4917352 encouraged or forced to buy their next vehicle instead of lease it
4917353 i like the fact that every two years you get a new car and you dont have to pay anything to return it
4917354 i cant drive a car for six or seven years i just cant do that
4917355 how much would you like to bet on what a cars worth three years from now given the circumstances
4917356 at a time when people are reconsidering their basic car buying decisions our business has been very strong
4917357 we dont feel the effects as much as a dealer or a bank or a manufacturer because people need transportation
4917358 itll be easier for me to make decisions on other cars if im stepping away from mine
4917359 if the city must provide a vehicle its going to be the most cost effective cost efficient model possible
4917360 this is an expense the city can no longer afford
4917361 its got some very strong community aspects to it beyond being very economical
4917362 my budgets what it is and i have to make that work
4917363 you dont want underutilized vehicles whether youre in this situation or not
4917364 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
4917365 he has the means to take it out we dont
4917366 for a long time hes worked with the white people
4917367 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
4917368 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
4917369 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
4917370 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
4917371 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
4917372 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
4917373 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
4917374 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
4917375 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
4917376 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
4917377 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
4917378 may moderate the relationship between e mail volume and feelings of e mail overload
4917379 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
4917380 if its a multiparty case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
4917381 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
4917382 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
4917383 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
4917384 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
4917385 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
4917386 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it is really misunderstood
4917387 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
4917388 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
4917389 its great to go out with your friends and play it doesnt hurt when you get shot you just get used to it
4917390 the problem before was there was no place around here for people to play
4917391 my main goal now is trying to perpetuate the fact that we exist
4917392 its as close to the professional sport seen on tv as youre going to see
4917393 weve had kids in with their dads weve had grandfathers a mom came here for a birthday party with a couple of 16 year olds
4917394 i want people to have a safe nice clean organized atmosphere
4917395 our goal is to make sure people come here and enjoy themselves
4917396 we want everybody to stay safe and have a good time
4917397 i like it because its different from any other sport
4917398 for less than 50 people can play here all day long
4917399 you better have size and you better be able to use that size if you want to match
4917400 we have a lot of work to do before we play tennessee and thats the bottom line
4917401 the coaches know that we know that the offensive line knows that the receivers know that and the defense knows that its all on us we have to fix it and well fix it in good time
4917402 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming
4917403 theres a whole number of issues they deliberately engineer to show they are an important power
4917404 they interpret weakness as a sign that they can go further
4917405 when you have a loss of life it really elevates things
4917406 everything you always wanted to know about your health care but were afraid to ask
4917407 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4917408 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
4917409 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4917410 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4917411 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4917412 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4917413 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4917414 its easier to decide to opt out if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4917415 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4917416 we are not staying home with our children by default
4917417 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4917418 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
4917419 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4917420 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4917421 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4917422 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
4917423 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
4917424 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
4917425 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
4917426 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
4917427 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends
4917428 if it works well go and see the new batman movie maybe
4917429 things are looking up houses are being taken over again its going good around here its a nice neighborhood its now real quiet everybody around here knows everybody its peaceful
4917430 before it used to be crazy in new bedford but not now its not safe but it is better than before
4917431 you know what i dont like i dont like to see people move out when they move from the neighborhood that bothers me
4917432 i dont like the foreclosures a lot of people are losing their homes
4917433 theres no question in my mind if someone needs a gallon of milk and they have no automobile where are they going to go you are going to see a lot of that and i am very happy i bought this
4917434 theres this tall guy with the newports he comes in and i say newports and he laughs now i cant sit down and talk to this guy but for some reason we get along he comes in here and
4917435 thats life youve got to be considerate of people nobodys perfect
4917436 were trying to get them thinking about and planning for plan b and plan c in the event their first choice is not available
4917437 the first semester the economy was still good jobs were aplenty i didnt think there would be problems
4917438 but as soon as 2008 hit the economy took a big downturn and the jobs dried up from last year to this year its changed quite a bit and its definitely been more difficult than i had anticipated
4917439 this market is one that just really needs to be navigated
4917440 its not like the old days where someone could pop a resume out there and get 15 interviews and five offers you have to seek out opportunities more than in the past in the past they were coming to you
4917441 having a college degree is not the guarantee of a good job with benefits the way it used to be
4917442 and college graduates are now being affected by the kind of squeeze being put on the middle class and blue collar workers for a long time
4917443 its a loss of resources its a social loss these are bright people who could be engaged in more productive activities but we havent figured out how to move them into productive activities
4917444 mainly the reason im doing this is because there are not a lot of jobs and i would rather be my own boss
4917445 in a tight labor market like this i would say employers are looking for the upper hand and trying to get more bang for their buck
4917446 theyre looking for different things theyre looking for the internship theyre looking for someone who is more aggressive
4917447 a lot of students have pride they dont want to ask mom and dad for connections but you need to tap into every network you have
4917448 as recent graduates coming out of college they need to be open to multiple types of career opportunities
4917449 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4917450 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4917451 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4917452 i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont
4917453 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4917454 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4917455 most home buyers or people refinancing their loans know there are financial booby traps waiting so theyre on the lookout for scams and junk fees
4917456 theres no purpose for both these fees other than to pad profit
4917457 in my opinion thats like a restaurant charging you more for napkins
4917458 future generations probably wont know what were talking about when we tell them about pine forests wed better start taking some photographs to show them
4917459 given the scale of the problem its going to be very difficult to get on top of this
4917460 if i was in spain just now id be extremely worried
4917461 in scientific circles we say nematodes are forever youre not going to be able to eradicate it its impossible
4917462 a lot of different ethnic groups are represented here so its always smelling good
4917463 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4917464 we will be gone at the end of the year
4917465 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4917466 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4917467 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4917468 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4917469 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4917470 we need to be able to be there for people who need us
4917471 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4917472 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4917473 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4917474 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4917475 ni turqu a ni ir n quieren que georgia sea un nuevo israel
4917476 rusia no se ir del c ucaso y emplear a fondo sus recursos para quedarse ya que si pierde el control del tr nsito de energ a perder esta regi n y tambi n asia central
4917477 nunca antes ni siquiera despu s de la primera guerra con georgia en 1992 1993 abjazia hab a controlado su territorio de una forma tan completa como hoy
4917478 pudimos haberlos fusilado pero no lo hicimos y por eso estoy contento
4917479 cuando hablan de batumi a los turcos se les caen las l grimas
4917480 de un solo golpe rusia puede romper todo lo que han hecho los norteamericanos durante a os basta un solo ca onazo sobre el oleoducto eso no ha sucedido pero hemos visto c mo han quedado destruidas las comunicaciones en poti senaki kuta si
4917481 coinciden con los nuestros adem s qu sentido tendr a que haber hecho tantas guerras por el c ucaso en el siglo xix
4917482 adem s creo que nos pueden reconocer tambi n otros pa ses pero por lo visto hay que pasar primero una serie de etapas
4917483 quienes est n dispuestos a adoptar la ciudadan a abjaza y renuncien a la georgiana
4917484 we will have what we believe is necessary to defeat this reckless proposal
4917485 we understand that people are frustrated with the economy frustrated with the situation with foreclosures and the price of gasoline we are concerned that that frustration might be reflected at the ballot box
4917486 people are hurting in this state the economy is still in rough shape and that is going to motivate people to vote yes on question 1
4917487 clearly our opposition is going to outspend us considerably we are hoping to raise as much as we can
4917488 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4917489 thats a lot of people needlessly hurt and a lot of time spent trying to sort out bad handwriting
4917490 it is fairly costly for a small practice to begin the change over to e prescribings so the incentives in this particular bill will help
4917491 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4917492 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4917493 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4917494 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4917495 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4917496 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4917497 no she lives in albuquerque its a city in a state called new mexico
4917498 english its not mexico its a state called new mexico

4917522 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store
4917523 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels
4917524 enterprise class projects including the linux kernel have more processes but that shows how seriously they take the project its less difficult to get code into a project if you understand the rules
4917525 it bit me and i know it bit coop because a lot of people probably thought that i should have been pulled
4917526 he stuck with me and im glad he did i told him to stick with me as long as possible because of the bullpen situation so im glad he showed a lot of confidence in me to try to face that one more hitter and it just didnt happen
4917527 friday we had to cover a lot of innings from a bullpen standpoint
4917528 the only real long guy was geoff geary with tim byrdak being down and chris sampson is down those guys probably need a couple days to bounce back they both threw 50 pitches or pretty close to 50 40 i think and 48 or something like that friday
4917529 i didnt have a pitch to throw inside on anybody righthanded or lefthanded it was ball 1 ball 2 its tough to pitch like that
4917530 i said i really need you to get this guy he said im ok i can do it thats why i left him in
4917531 the worst thing that could happen with cooper asking me to get through this one more hitter ultimately happened
4917532 i take all the blame he doesnt get blame for leaving me in

4917546 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area

4917721 wanita yang sedang menyusui kerap mengeluh demam selain itu payudara akan terasa sakit dan memerah kalau infeksi sudah parah bisa pecah seperti bisul
4917722 ini dapat menyebabkan tumbuh payudara lebih dari sepasang oleh sebab itu beberapa wanita memiliki payudara lebih dari sepasang bahkan payudara tambahan ini kadang dilengkapi puting susu juga
4917723 lebih sering terjadi adanya gumpalan kelenjar payudara pada salah satu sisi ketiak tapi ada pula yang kelenjar payudaranya tidak terbentuk sama sekali atau perkembangan kedua payudara tidak berjalan normal

4917740 yeah thats a nice argument only if it was true the democrats lost their majority in 1994 while the lewinsky scandal was in 1998 by the way democrats gained seats during the so called scandal

4917742 they told us that it was snowing and below freezing at the top but i dont think we realized exactly how cold we would be
4917743 it was tough because we were already wet from the rain at the bottom and then the further we went the colder it got
4917744 i was shivering so hard that my legs were cramping up
4917745 i was doing ok until a frame and then the snow and hail really started
4917746 i finished faster than my prediction time but then again i think it was because i was worried about frostbite
4917747 but i think ill be back again next year to give it another shot
4917748 shes never trained in the cold or at altitude before so im pretty worried
4917749 she was supposed to call my cell phone if she was turning back but i dont get reception up here
4917750 this is by far the most challenging run ive had up this mountain

4917752 i live at about 7 000 feet and ive spent the last 13 days above 13 000 feet
4917753 i dont really think its the altitude thats the challenge but this year it was definitely the cold its something different every year but i think thats part of what keeps us all coming back
4917754 in a way its a no brainer but i still agonize over these decisions
4917755 this is my third close of the course and i just feel for all of those people who are on time and planning to make it they trained all summer in some cases all year they come from miles away and im so sorry they got that far and had to go back down it really hurts
4917756 it just whupped my tail i underestimated the conditions in nature there is no forgiveness in there in some cases there is no room for error it was bad for everybody
4917757 the main thing is to keep people moving up or down
4917758 the longer theyre out there the more exposure theyll have to the elements
4917759 some of the runners coming down toward us told us the race had been called
4917760 when i heard there was ice i was ready to go back i really didnt think ice and slippery steep terrain were a good idea im not mad or anything like that they have no control over the weather and i think they had to keep safety in mind
4917761 there had been people warning us that we should go back since around barr camp
4917762 they told us the race was over when we got to a frame which made me really mad since i really wanted to finish
4917763 some put in as much as 22 to 23 miles today
4917764 weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions

4917834 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4917835 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4917836 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4917881 to me bernie was more than a tv uncle he was a mentor and someone i truly looked up to he was the embodiment of kindness professionalism and generosity

4917895 the pennhurst story was and continues to be about failing to recognize the worth of people and places that whether we like or it not defines us

4917897 people really believed that people with mental retardation had no feelings so they werent bothered by being naked in a room with 100 other naked people
4917898 its really odd what we are able to justify once we divorce ourselves from people
4917899 when we dehumanize and write off a segment of our society and render them non people we can get away with a lot of horrible things
4917900 it is a problem if we dont recall the mistakes we made as a society
4917901 in my judgment the state was derelict in letting this go on for decades
4917902 it might be far easier for a developer to retrofit and not tear them down

4917910 and if someone puts up harassing statements about a student online that all her classmates read that could create an intimidating or hostile educational environment for the victim at school

4917912 dont take it personally the art of dealing with rejection
4917913 it absolutely relates to their relationships say youre a girl and youre bullied by a girl you may grow up and not trust female friends these are lasting scars you never forget the hurtful slurs and actions
4917914 im nearly 62 years old very happily married now with a great son but i can still vividly remember the horrible abuse and bullying i received throughout my school years they taunted me about how skinny i was and how crooked my teeth were i suffer from recurring bouts of depression and i blame it on the fact that i was conditioned to depression because of the abuse i endured as a child
4917915 lack of clarity on the legal parameters the incidents can be very difficult to unravel and find out who is the real victim and many school officials and safe schools personnel understandably do not fully understand youth culture online

4917938 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4917939 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4917940 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4917941 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4917957 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4917958 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4917959 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation

4917967 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4917968 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4917969 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4917970 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4917971 person who is reclusive bungles small talk and spurns social interaction with other humans except for a select few
4917972 im going to come in here with a giant trash bag if you dont
4917973 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4917974 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4917975 what ive been saying the whole time is that its a good thing that we get to work with both quarterbacks
4917976 most of the time during the year you have to use more than one quarterback sometime down the road we might have to use that second quarterback and all this work that were getting will be good when he comes in so he already has a good feel for everybody
4917977 our offensive line i think will be able to protect just as well as any other offensive line i dont see any reason why the tight ends would have to stay in and block any extra than we usually do
4917978 i think it takes just a couple meetings a couple times watching tape and watching our guys and how hard they play and how our veterans emphasize it how they talk about it every day and how lovie talks about it
4917979 that makes a big difference for the young players a guy like tight end kellen davis has never played special teams a lot of those guys who were stars never played it
4917980 but if we can take that talent that they had in college and put the effort in on special teams were going to get exactly what we want
4917981 i think the issue has been vastly overblown and overstated often by politicians and others who dont fully understand frankly this industry there is absolutely no evidence none that playing a violent video game leads to aggressive behavior
4917982 from infancy humans learn how to perceive interpret judge and respond to events in the physical and social environment various types of knowledge structures for these tasks develop over time they are based on day to day observations of and interactions with other people real as in the family and imagined as in the media each violent media exposure is essentially one more learning trial
4917983 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4917984 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4917985 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4917986 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
4917987 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
4917988 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4917989 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4917990 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4917991 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4917992 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4917993 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4917994 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4917995 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground

4917999 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4918000 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4918001 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4918002 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4918003 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4918004 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4918005 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4918006 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4918007 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4918008 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

4918018 i should create a line that pays homage to designer clothing in a respectful way while being vegan id stay true to the spirit of the clothing but it wouldnt be a knockoff per say
4918019 what if i cobbled together a team of talented vegan designers and said enhance this concept in a cruelty free way
4918020 um i cant come to your wedding this weekend because im dead
4918021 lets not forget that the little emotions are the great captains of our lives and we obey them without realizing it
4918022 well if i felt like that in my heart and in my soul im really not sure how id feel
4918023 i think that i would feel that its as difficult as you do
4918024 scent marketing institute announces winners of their first round of awards called smitties
4918025 this summer iron maiden is on a massive world tour
4918026 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4918027 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4918028 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4918029 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4918030 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4918031 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4918032 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4918033 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4918034 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4918035 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4918036 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4918037 this is a planning took where all things are going
4918038 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4918039 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4918040 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4918041 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4918042 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4918043 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4918044 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4918045 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4918046 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4918047 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4918048 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4918049 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4918050 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4918051 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4918052 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4918053 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4918054 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4918055 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4918056 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4918057 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4918058 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4918059 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4918060 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4918061 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4918062 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4918063 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4918064 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4918065 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4918066 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4918067 riders report being spat on sat on and thrown up on

4918082 we zijn toen begonnen met de klassieke hulpverleners zoals kinesisten logopedisten ergotherapeuten maar als ouder wil je natuurlijk het onderste uit de kan halen om je kind zo goed mogelijk te helpen en zo kwamen wij terecht bij mensen die zich bezighielden met bewegen in warm water voor kinderen met een handicap

4918085 tenslotte heeft hij een dochter met een handicap ik denk in eerste instantie dat zoiets al niet gemakkelijk is om te gaan aanvaarden als ouder maar hij heeft eigenlijk iets negatiefs proberen om te buigen naar iets positiefs
4918086 voor mij gaat het er eigenlijk om een uurtje te genieten als ik in het zwembad kom dan gaat de wereld eigenlijk open dan kan ik eens op mijn benen staan en dat kan ik niet buiten het water dus dat is echt wel een vrijheid van oef eindelijk eens kunnen rond gaan en dat is wel tof dankzij het zwemmen ben ik veel soepeler en dat gevoel van altijd zitten ben ik dan even kwijt als ik niet ga zwemmen heb ik s avonds echt eens iets van sorry ik moet nu gaan liggen ik moet nu echt een andere houding aannemen dat heb je natuurlijk veel minder als je hier geweest bent want dan ben je sowieso in een andere houding
4918087 moesten mijn partner en ik niet zo positief ingesteld zijn zouden we niet staan waar we nu staan ik heb de mentaliteit van mijn vader en dat doet toch ook veel vanaf het moment dat je de moed verloren hebt denk ik dat je beter in een hoekje kunt gaan zitten ik probeer echt zoveel mogelijk zelf te doen een goede soldaat trekt zijn plan
4918088 mijn vader ziet elke dag het werk dat hij doet hij heeft daar enorm veel voldoening van dat maakt het eigenlijk mooi de dingen die je hier soms ziet gebeuren zijn denk ik voor hem niet met geld te betalen
4918089 het is misschien heel gemakkelijk te zeggen als dochter van de directeur maar ik vind dat je hier toch wel het gevoel hebt dat je welkom bent en je wordt hier absoluut niet buiten gekeken omwille van je handicap je kent de mensen die hier komen het geeft een heel broederlijke sfeer je kunt voor een stuk op elkaar terugvallen we praten met elkaar en kunnen dan ervaringen uitwisselen
4918090 het is gewoon zalig voor die kinderen dat ze hier kunnen komen ze genieten daar ontzettend van dat zie je ook ik vind dat dus een ontzettend goed initiatief van de ludo dat die daarmee begonnen is
4918091 het is een klein gestructureerd zwembad dat niet te druk is ze hebben in de kleedkamer ook mandjes staan elk kind heeft zijn of haar mand deze kinderen hebben structuur nodig en dat kan in een ander zwembad niet dolfijntje is ideaal
4918092 ze liggen met hun hoofd op je schouder je zit daar dus echt te knuffelen en dat is toch een andere band dan wanneer je ze in de klas ziet
4918093 die drie combinaties houden me op de been ik moet aan mezelf blijven werken en dat weet ik
4918094 wat mij vooral opvalt is dat de kinderen hier zo gelukkig worden ook de begeleiders die zich zo voor de kinderen inzetten bewonder ik
4918095 het is plezant voor die kinderen dat ze die bekende vlamingen eens in het echt krijgen te zien de gasten dromen er nu al van terwijl ik droom van nog tien zwembaden in elke provincie een
4918096 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4918097 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many

4918129 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
4918130 the overwhelming demand for new web sites and domain names makes the establishment of new suffixes inevitable

4918139 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4918140 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4918141 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4918142 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4918143 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4918144 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4918145 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4918146 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4918147 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4918148 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4918149 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4918150 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4918151 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4918152 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4918153 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4918154 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4918155 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4918156 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4918157 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4918158 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4918159 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

4918182 today new york state becomes the national public health leader in tobacco taxation

4918189 you wake up put on the coffee and get ready for work then just as youre reaching for the cell phone you remember that today is the beginning of mental detox week today youre not going to listen to your ipod you arent going to stare at a computer screen any more than you absolutely have to today you wont worry about unanswered email and youre not going to login to facebook youll cut the time you spend on digital devices right down to the bone in the evening maybe you will watch your favorite tv show for an hour but after that you switch off have a conversation wash the dishes read for a bit and just relax you do that for five days and then on friday night you make a decision to unplug completely for the whole weekend for a couple of days you might feel like an addict in withdrawal peevish agitated and distracted but then something will happen your over stimulated brain will cleanse itself youll relax youll feel calmer more grounded
4918190 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4918191 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4918192 we know that there is time left and were playing well
4918193 he was all over the place i think he was trying to do too much out there today
4918194 i was mad that he made the call before the pitch got to the catcher the ball was halfway there when he called it a strike i dont think it was right i was disappointed about it
4918195 were right in the middle of things for the wild card and i know these guys are playing hard
4918196 he can hit run and hes very smart i hope he keeps doing what hes doing
4918197 the truth is that since the last year or so i havent got good film offers at all trash was coming to me in the name of scripts i am not insecure that i would go for any role im in a position now that i dont need to compromise
4918198 i took a sabbatical for a year and a half and that is when people in the industry realised my worth i have some good films now both as an actor and a producer and i am very happy
4918199 popcorn motion pictures is my obsession i started my career as a businessman with a restaurant and garment business but suniel shetty the businessman can take over only movies and not any other venture
4918200 action has risen to a different level today it is mostly special effects we used to perform our stunts on our own and today the actors use all kinds of props there lies a difference between men and boys now
4918201 after watching the show i think guys should stop talking about action and start getting inspired from women
4918202 ive learnt a lot today i understand my character i have tried my hand at everything from action romance to comedy im the only actor to have worked with over 90 directors and different roles
4918203 money comes last and self respect comes first for me i want to have goodwill in the industry im only looking forward to people appreciating my work in the future
4918204 i will move to risd to push the needs of putting creativity and expression first and foremost as not only a means to realize global economic expansion but also as the only means to realize a truly human oriented world built upon what matters most which is feelings in my mind
4918205 im just following my own advice from the laws of simplicity when people dont have to guess what im thinking and simply know what im thinking i think that everyone breathes easier including me it can be applied to any aspect of business and creative relationships
4918206 change the paradigm of creativity in the business world define shift from tech led revolution to a design based revolution in the global economy
4918207 every action you take has to be about the next next next next step otherwise you are not innovating instead youre just improving

4918214 when booz allen hamilton asked marketers which organizations would become more important to them by 2010 media companies media planners and communications planners topped the list with 52 believing they would be more integral ad agencies of record only 27 thought they would be more integral at the same time 53 of media agencies say they expect to do more business directly with marketers
4918215 media companies sit on top of a two way media platform and with all these shifts of marketing becoming more of a conversation they can listen and learn and potentially influence better than in the past
4918216 there is a very subtle classification going on that is much less apparent than before
4918217 it complicates things enormously but it also makes things much more exciting
4918218 these are working poor and many of them have never visited a food pantry before so we know the need is greater than ever as we head into the winter months the demand will go even higher because of rising heating and fuel costs
4918219 it puts us in contact with new businesses and new agencies and also has a tremendous positive impact on the clients we serve
4918220 food drives are simple projects that can be done on a small scale by an individual or on a large scale by dozens of people its a great way for everyone to participate in make a difference day because almost anyone can donate a can of soup or box of macaroni and cheese

4918235 my upbringing never really allowed me to think theater could be more than a hobby my working class irish parents both had eighth grade educations and suffered the great depression they would have been excited if i got a nice steady gig in the post office
4918236 i couldnt move around the stage like i used to i couldnt take parts and it was frustrating i think i was driving my wife crazy
4918237 i get a kick just to experience my plays being performed on any stage
4918238 i was taking in everyones reaction i was looking for people to laugh nod and especially for the parts where they seemed bored i was open to that because this is how you make a play better until its performed its just words on a page you need to hear it to see what youve got one of my frustrations as a playwright is that despite all the theaters around here theres not a lot of opportunity to do this kind of thing i know they have to make money but i would love to see them support local playwrights more because ill tell you having a reading its the best way to write a play you need actors and lighting and staging and direction
4918239 they say playwriting is the hardest medium and i have to tell you i dont understand how people who have not acted can do it
4918240 i tell him all the time to set his plays in the 40s and 50s
4918241 he has a wonderful sense of that time his plays are very sentimental in a way that i think is sweet but not too saccharine his dialogue is very witty which is no surprise hes one of the funniest people ive ever met
4918242 i often think that living so close to so many people in such close quarters is why i am a playwright all that dialogue all those characters i draw on all those people in my plays i am always thinking of characters people situations scenes and many of them are based on people i know
4918243 i was the kidder the character the one who loved to entertain and crack everyone up
4918244 but now i realize that i was just bored i was creative always have been and i didnt really have an outlet
4918245 even if it couldnt be my lifes work i wanted it for a hobby
4918246 i have this thing against wine snobs and art snobs
4918247 if i have something to say its that we can all appreciate art without being pretentious about it
4918248 i cant look left or right i just keep moving ahead
4918249 the most dramatic thing about it is the difference in styles the matchmaker is so quick and so precise hamlet is so dark you
4918250 you can read all of the different books which can be advantageous in my opinion but then you have to do your own work
4918251 im not going to do burtons hamlet or oliviers hamlet because theyre not me
4918252 i think playing flora encourages me to be freer with hamlet flora is telling hamlet to take himself less seriously
4918253 in that closet scene what is the relationship between hamlet and his mother
4918254 you have to remember that powerful women needed alliances in that time and she really fell for this guy
4918255 i dont think anybody working on this project or on any production looks at it that way
4918256 my own experience in life is that you find things to laugh at even in very bad times
4918257 they were doing medieval things to my chest but there were things i found really funny about the whole experience
4918258 that search for happiness seems so much a part of modern american history
4918259 just as my dads generation experimented with drugs so did my generation which is sad and funny
4918260 it seems to me sometimes that were never satisfied if its hot we want it to be cold when its cold we want it to be hot discontent seems to be what a lot of life is about happiness and joy are the exception
4918261 as things become more perfect the more aware we are of flaws i think drugs are a good metaphor for a lot of what has happened
4918262 scan my own past and create a work of fiction
4918263 euthanasia became a personal experience for derek humphry when his first wife jean who was suffering from terminal breast cancer asked him to help her die this unhappy event and the public interest surrounding it caused him to found the nonprofit national hemlock society and become the champion of this cause
4918264 through essays and briefings humphrys latest book dying with dignity helps readers work their way through the labyrinth of complex issues which comprise the subject
4918265 the case for rational suicide when suicide is justified and the ethical parameters of autoeuthanasia i e the taking of ones own life
4918266 the trend toward acceptance why more judges are increasingly ruling for the terminally ill patients rights over the hospitals responsibilities to preserve life
4918267 evidence of the dramatic growth of the right to die movement
4918268 questions and answers about the hemlock society answers including why this pioneer group was formed and what its political goals are specific questions regarding the pros and cons of different suicide methods are also discussed

4918273 but coach lewis and other area coaches really helped me out you just have no idea until youre sitting in the seat
4918274 weve got potential but potential and 50 cents will get you a cup of coffee actually its probably potential and four bucks will get you a cup of coffee today
4918275 we may have a couple of freshmen starting for us
4918276 weve got to have a lot of success early to build confidence
4918277 they exert a lot of energy and then take a break
4918278 its hurting us immensely since were in the western part of the miami valley
4918279 its a double edged sword as an independent were not in a geographic friendly league theres an added burden of almost having to go anywhere to play we dont want to cut back on any activities because its all about the kids and participation
4918280 well double up reserve and varsity teams at the same site instead of flip flopping home and away
4918281 our neighbors are d iii and iv so we have to travel to find the best d i competition thatll benefit our athletes
4918282 were limiting district travel activities within the boundaries of our conference southwestern buckeye league
4918283 we cant afford to go to sidney anymore for a softball or volleyball contest
4918284 it depends who it is where the game is and is it a rivalry
4918285 im sure a few fans will make the decision not to travel to certain games parents will go within reason were playing a football game on the road in indiana against indianapolis arlington and our parents are chartering a bus thats cheaper youre going to see more of that
4918286 were working with the education purchasing cooperative in vandalia to make diesel a commodity so we can lock in the price
4918287 right now we just grin and bear it as the price climbs
4918288 were concerned about the impact fuel prices will continue to have on attendance at ohsaa tournaments since that is the lifeblood of our funding at both the district and state levels
4918289 there has also been some talk of some schools possibly limiting the number of nonconference road trips and or the distance their teams can travel
4918290 these brutal fuel prices are starting to change the way ads are thinking
4918291 we scheduled this game before the diesel prices made the big jump fortunately we had a person and a business step forward to donate the costs
4918292 i recently had a volleyball coach ask about playing a jayvee match in columbus and i told him we couldnt provide transportation
4918293 were tied to the greater catholic league in cincinnati but there is already talk in the future of modifying the schedule so there will not be so many trips to cincinnati for the dayton area teams
4918294 were not that wealthy but our parents will spend to follow their kids its not an issue now it could well be in the future
4918295 another sister tammy just graduated from sinclair community college in interior design she was a good athlete in high school
4918296 were the biggest team in the state and i already know everyones name
4918297 weve been successful and people want to be a part of it
4918298 the seniors make it easier to coach theyre a good class and know how to support each other
4918299 weckesser sets us up to peak at the end of the season so we may not run our best during the middle of the season

4918304 i told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said make me
4918305 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head
4918306 there were six or seven really big buff guys on top of my dad hitting him i had to try and pull him out
4918307 i am certainly not a hero i just defended my property and my sons friends there were a group of 15 year old girls there too
4918308 people have had enough this gang has been terrorising people whose kids are having parties for months now somebody needed to stand up to them
4918309 i know that if dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on
4918310 all i would suggest if a situation arises again leave it to the police to handle
4918311 ich wei nicht was geschehen ist ich passe immer auf was ich einnehme
4918312 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4918313 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4918314 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4918315 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4918316 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4918317 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4918318 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4918322 we just need to keep working on that and realize that weve won a preseason game its good in some ways but in others it doesnt mean anything
4918323 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4918324 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4918325 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4918326 were not going to make every play but there were plays we left out on the field
4918327 when i have mike walker running down pretty much wide open i know he kind of got jammed at the line but i still have to make that a catchable ball for him you dont want to miss your layups
4918328 he came in last week and picked up the playbook in two days maybe he became a leader on offense in the first day

4918332 theres no other purpose to the cross no communication no particular message it was intended to cause fear and to terrorize a population
4918333 regardless of what obama might say about particular decisions obamas justices would not only presumably make up these new rights they would strip us of our second amendment rights while giving child rapists more rights and taking away the rights of the people through their legislators to make these important decisions
4918334 hit the next one in the water and ill give you twenty bucks
4918335 has this guy been watching thats the dumbest bet ever
4918336 let the club do the work its not a baseball bat
4918337 people are pretty particular about getting their little jewels out on a rainy day
4918338 we saw that last years event was very well received which is why we wanted to make it even bigger this year
4918339 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4918340 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4918341 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4918342 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4918343 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4918344 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4918345 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4918346 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4918347 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4918348 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
4918349 with 4 gas people who cant afford vacations wild prices on food and so forth theyre really looking for something to cheer for and the american team and the olympic athletes certainly offer that

4918360 immorality the morality of those who are having a better time
4918361 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
4918362 it has become clear in recent months that a critical mass of the american
4918363 right you are correct someone hooked me i do believe in building relationships that is what christians are required to do i am amoral i am sure you know what that means so are scorpios i am being protected by the formosa rule because of my mental illness i am not targeting teh mop jockey you are and you are using me as a bait please stop i have my own fish to reel in leave me alone it is my hope that i will be able to catch a fish and reel it in for you once my retired bishop thought i was fishing for him and he took the bait alas it wasnt me and that spelled the demise of our relationship have a little bit more faith in me an eastern orthodox bishop thought i was fishing for him and willingly proudly and defiantly took the bait on public record and it wasnt even me give me a break
4918364 both the learned counsel for the petitioners conceded in plain terms that the country was in a grip of terrorism extremism and militancy and
4918365 there was a lack of harmony and cohesion among various institutions of the state and none of them was in a position to provide a solution to the situation faced by the country on or before 3 rd november 2007 therefore in order to save the country from chaos and anarchy was made in the larger interests of the state necessity and for the welfare of the people
4918366 this house is of the considered view that the serious circumstances were prevailing in the country
4918367 the above resolution of the national assembly meets the argument of the petitioners that the government ought to have approached the parliament for an appropriate action under the constitution
4918368 the most dangerous nation in the world isnt iraq its pakistan
4918369 we resent reject and condemn the article on pakistan published in the 29 october issue of the newsweek this report is false misleading and intended to convey a highly negative image of pakistan it betrays complete ignorance and lack of understanding about the fundamental realities in pakistan
4918370 the story de legitimizes the very foundation of pakistan it also attacks the founder of pakistan and this is my biggest objection to that story
4918371 the tug of war launched by the former chief justice of pakistan and some other former judges of the supreme court and the high courts against the other branches of the government made them non functional and ineffective
4918372 it was an act unbecoming of a person who happened to be the chief justice of pakistan and thus the dignity and prestige of the highest judicial office of the country were disregarded
4918373 the behavior of the former chief justice created an unpleasant scene
4918374 what treatment would you recommend if i were a family member
4918375 what if it gets out of hand what if what seems like a compassionate solution to mother child separation ends up keeping children with their mothers in prison for longer periods of time
4918376 the majority of the 1 5 million children of incarcerated parents are black or latino
4918377 on face value i think the ohio mothers program is wonderful
4918378 im not ever going to say that you should not keep a mother with her child but nordette they didnt end up in prison because theyre bad mothers
4918379 if you can put this type of program into place while theyre there why couldnt you have had something in place to help before they got there
4918380 you wanted the rights of a man so take this like a man
4918381 i mean these grandmothers would be getting evicted right while their daughters talked to them on the phone
4918382 it being away from the children was hard i had to put it out of my mind and trust that the village that i built would be enough would be sustaining if i had had to go through that time and worry about them i couldnt have done it
4918383 when doug peters was hired it was with the acknowledgement he was very pro downtown
4918384 but as his tenure continued on his focus changed as we moved to a world economy he widened his scope to include all of hancock county which he needed to do he did a good job at that but the identity of downtown suffered
4918385 anybody that owns property downtown wants to see their property value increase
4918386 we dont do a very good job of promoting where the parking is
4918387 were not going to be able to create parking in front of everybodys door
4918388 we may have to create parking a block off of main street or two blocks off of main street
4918389 if we can create something and educate the people that theres plenty of parking a block away thats what we need to do

4918409 it has been this way for quite a few years and the increased threats against israel has not changed this
4918410 the americans assert that their systems could detect activity deep underground
4918411 but this is not correct and they dont want israel to find this out
4918412 the israelis got some earlier bunker buster models but not the latest weapons systems

4918423 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4918424 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4918425 poetry is a kind of distilled insinuation its a way of expanding and talking around an idea or a question sometimes more actually gets said through such a technique than a full frontal assault

4918430 we went visiting teaching today and after the lesson ended we just ended up talking with marsha for two hours i couldnt believe it when i looked at the clock but then we just kept talking for another half an hour we had such a blast getting to know each other better i cant wait to go back next month
4918431 if i go home teaching at 11 45 p m on july 31st and the lesson lasts until 12 15 a m on august 1st could that count as my visit for both july and august
4918432 in my old stake they put on a super saturday for guys every march classes included plumbing drywall repair and computer repair among other things it would end outside in the parking lot with a massive barbecue of hot dogs hamburgers and male bonding

4918460 while the christian moralist in oneself was impelled to deplore the atrocious nature of the iras campaign of bombings and killings and the mere irish in oneself was appalled by the ruthlessness of the british army on occasions like bloody sunday in derry in 1972 the minority citizen in oneself the one who had grown up conscious that his group was distrusted and discriminated against in all kinds of official and unofficial ways this citizens perception was at one with the poetic truth of the situation in recognizing that if life in northern ireland were ever really to flourish change had to take place but that citizens perception was also at one with the truth in recognizing that the very brutality of the mans by which the ira was pursuing change was destructive of the trust upon which new possibilities would have to be based

4918498 well what i mean is maybe maybe the stars are there to make sure the sky is never empty
4918499 well during the day we have the sun but at night we dont always have the moon sometimes its not there so maybe maybe god gave us the stars so when were alone at night and we can look up at the sky and see the stars and then we can remember that were never really alone weve always got the stars you know

4918504 a lot of rubbish is talked about the hijab since france banned girls from wearing them in schools in 2004 there has been a steady stream of media stories and comment suggesting that britain should do the same
4918505 moest er mij iets overkomen terwijl ik met azg weg ben zou dat spijtig zijn maar dan gebeurt het terwijl ik iets doe wat ik graag doe
4918506 het is een verwezelijking van een kinderdroom mijn nonkel is missionaris en zo kwam ik al vroeg in contact met de derde wereld ik wou naar het buitenland trekken en dat heeft mijn studies be nvloed ik volgde verpleegkunde en tropische geneeskunde om later naar de tropen te gaan de eerste keer vertrek je natuurlijk vanuit het idealisme dat je de mensen gaat helpen maar ik heb gemerkt dat je op zon reis ook aan jezelf bouwt je schaaft je vaardigheden kennis en cultuur bij terwijl je je werk verricht hoe meer ik wegga hoe minder ik het alleen doe om anderen te helpen dit blijft de hoofd reden maar dat neemt niet weg dat het ook is om mezelf te ontplooien dat maakt het ook zo spannend elke keer terug te vertrekken
4918507 ik pauzeer graag tussen de verschillende missies om even op mijn effen te komen en terug aan het belgisch werkcircuit te wennen het is een heel mooie ervaring maar het vreet aan je ik wil dan ook de tijd nemen om terug op mijn positieven te komen en zo genoeg energie vergaren om terug te kunnen vertrekken van de zeven jaar dat ik voor azg werk heb ik er ongeveer twee in het buitenland doorge bracht
4918508 wanneer ik beslis op een volgende missie te gaan betekent het automatisch dat andere dromen moeten wachten ook je eigen huis en spullen weer achterlaten is niet evident je kan nog zeggen dat je er niet veel belang aan hecht maar het blijft moeilijk telkens ik thuis kom zeg ik dat het de laatste keer is geweest toen ik na negen maanden ha ti terugkwam wou ik er een punt achter zetten als ik dan iedereen weer gezien heb en op emotioneel vlak tot rust gekomen ben maak ik me toch klaar om opnieuw te vertrekken misschien wel voor de laatste keer
4918509 niet altijd het hangt van de situatie af sommige omstandigheden kan je beter aan dan andere het heeft ook te maken met de persoon die je bent soms wordt je overstelpt met miserie en heb je het gevoel dat je niet veel kan veranderen dat is zeker een gevoel dat overstemt toch geloof ik graag dat ik mijn steentje bijdraag al is het maar op menselijk vlak dat is iets wat je bijleert door verschillende keren te vertrekken je gaat de wereld zeker niet veranderen de kleine dingen zoals een glimlach van een pati nt zijn dan momenten waar ik me aan optrek daarvoor moet je geen 1000 km ver zijn maar het bewijst dat je aanwezigheid toch iets te betekenen heeft
4918510 de eerste keer bleef het bij brieven sturen dat had zijn charmes maar met de komst van het internet werd corresponderen met het thuisfront gemakkelijker tenminste als je in een hoofdstad verblijft wanneer we in de brousse zijn communi ceren we via een sateliettelefoon of radiogolven dit laatste systeem heet wave mailen langs deze weg kunnen we berichten opsturen naar de hoofdstad waar ze dan via het internet naar je correspondent gemaild worden je moet je dan wel beperken tot de kern van de familie maar de evolutie staat niet stil tegenwoordig kan je op sommige plaatsen zelfs al met je gsm contact houden dat was vijf jaar geleden ondenkbaar
4918511 ik ga graag op reis om kennis te maken met andere talen telkens ik terugkom van een missie is er wel een of ander woordje dat ik blijf gebruiken zoals ego wat kirundisch is voor ja of zikomo bwambiri wat hartelijk dank betekent in het tshitshewas een taal leren is heel plezant ik kan vaak maar enkele woordjes of zinnetjes onthouden maar die neem ik mee voor de rest van mijn leven
4918512 het voordeel van een verpleegkundige ten opzichte van een arts is dat wij zeer gegeerd zijn op de arbeidsmarkt ik heb het geluk dat ik altijd naar hetzelfde ziekenhuis in brussel kan terugkeren daar werk ik volgens contracten van onbepaalde duur als ik dan te horen krijg dat ik naar het buitenland moet zeg ik mijn contract op dat brengt automatisch met zich mee dat ik mijn huidige functie binnen het ziekenhuis verlies wat jammer is maar ik hou van variatie het is vooral belangrijk dat ik mijn job als verpleegkundige kan blijven uitoefenen
4918513 vroeger werkten we volgens een contract voor vrijwilligers maar dat is achterhaald azg is aan het professionaliseren en werkt nu volgens arbeids contracten van bepaalde duur dat wil zeggen dat je bijvoorbeeld tekent voor een periode van zes maanden we krijgen nu ook een volwaardig loon helemaal gratis werken is dezer dagen niet meer mogelijk want je moet iets hebben om op terug te vallen wanneer je thuiskomt in vergelijking met een belgisch loon verdien je minder maar niet in het bijzonder zeker niet als verpleegkundige een chirurg met dezelfde verantwoordelijkheden zal evenveel verdienen als ik
4918514 tot voor kort zat azg daar nog maar ze zijn weggegaan omdat er dagelijks aanslagen en zelfmoordaanslagen plaatsvonden je moet geen onberekende risicos nemen werken waar een gevoel van onveiligheid overheerst brengt stress met zich mee maar dat schrikt mij niet af je loopt natuurlijk altijd een minimum aan risico we gaan niet naar het paradijs h voor mensen die een gezin hebben ligt de situatie wel helemaal anders ik ben alleen verantwoordelijk voor mijzelf moest er mij iets over komen terwijl ik met azg weg ben zou dat spijtig zijn maar dan gebeurt het terwijl ik iets doe wat ik graag doe
4918515 normaal gezien zat ik nu in tsjaad waar ik zou ingeschakeld worden in een programma voor het behandelen van vesico vaginale fistels ongeveer twee miljoen vrouwen leidt aan deze problematiek waarbij een onnatuurlijke opening tussen de blaas en de vagina of de darmen en de vagina gevormd wordt het gevolg is dat ze niets meer kunnen ophouden vele onder hen worden verstoten plegen zelfmoord of sterven vroeg omdat ze in erbarmelijke omstandig heden moesten leven het was onze taak deze meisjes te opereren maar dit project werd jammer genoeg uitgesteld omdat onze chirurg afhaakte maar ik sta paraat als ze mij morgen bellen pak ik mijn koffers en vertrek

4918525 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4918526 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4918527 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4918528 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4918529 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4918530 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4918531 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4918532 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4918533 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible

4918535 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4918536 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4918537 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4918538 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4918539 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4918540 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4918541 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4918542 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4918543 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4918544 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4918545 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4918546 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4918547 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4918548 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4918549 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4918550 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4918551 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming

4918553 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4918554 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4918555 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4918556 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4918616 kashmiri muslims with their distorted perspectives dont realise that disrespect towards a religion is un islamic

4918629 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed

4918636 pockets of iraq are humming along other sections not so much i think the government of iraq has to do things on its own you can only help them so much
4918637 we have to leave in a responsible manner that means playing hardball with the iraq government
4918638 the gospel does teach us about caring for our fellow man
4918639 el greco to velazquez art during the reign of philip iii
4918640 i think were going to have problems with crowd management but well figure that out
4918641 when you have an event like the nasher exhibition something as prominent as this it shows all of us that the arts can achieve a hugely prominent role on campus
4918642 when someone comes back voluntarily even years later they almost always arent prosecuted for desertion
4918643 our preference would have been for him to turn himself in but we dont advise people what to do
4918644 we can tell them what has happened to others in the same situation
4918645 id happily go to jail rather than shoot innocent iraqis or kill anyone
4918646 its always very difficult to say what will happen in any given case
4918647 i found out that walking trails are the no 1 requested amenity in subdivisions
4918648 there is a tremendous amount of activity in this area
4918649 i now recognize that the trail system can be an economic boon to areas which are on the trail system
4918650 it was an awesome feeling to get it on fourth and one right guard jonas jennings said
4918651 its awesome for the offensive line because we always want to run it
4918652 a language is a dialect with an army and a navy
4918653 thank you for opening your heart to those who needed a shoulder to lean on
4918654 he had a lot of positive energy that made people feel comfortable
4918655 to promote the use and understanding of the content management system drupal by libraries and librarians
4918656 i think mccain would be a better president because of his level of experience
4918657 even though id love to see an african american in office i just dont see obama as having enough experience
4918658 hes much more appealing when it comes to a brighter outlook and a better attitude
4918659 its infectious you finally have someone whos out there trying to pump you up and say good things
4918660 you have a number of democrats who are unsure about obama for a variety of reasons his race may be part of it also that hes new on the scene and there are all these rumors that are going around
4918661 the whole thing is a self consciously transparent effort to mention doles age and tie it to her supposed ineffectiveness without actually mentioning her age like say starting a speech with a list of all the things you arent going to say
4918662 and the actors stilted delivery actually contributes to the effect making the spot which exaggerates doles longevity by a two whole decades after all seem like a delightfully dry snl spoof
4918663 this endorsement comes just at the right time because my oil light just came on
4918664 what up g yeah i know i know jesus shouldnt be black
4918665 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4918666 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate come down anytime day or night we have nothing to hide
4918667 the public will desert any sport that they feel doesnt have integrity
4918668 i hope and pray we dont have another offence this year and that there is no fallout from the 100m
4918669 i understand the scepticism there is about the winner of the 100m being clean
4918670 it comes with the territory as past champions have been revealed as being doped
4918671 the olympic champion does have to carry himself as being a clean athlete
4918672 he bolt is the best thing that has happened to track and field
4918673 i had no doubts that islambek was going to win the gold he acquired that confidence on his way to the finals and the final event was for me a mere formality of course i was on the edge of my seat cant deny that i was really sweating and praying for them
4918674 its a controversy thats been going on around the country for five or six years
4918675 if they say you can win 10 000 on the ticket or whatever amount you should be able to win it
4918676 it seems only fair the odds are against you anyway
4918677 the current track has it going north into georgia wednesday or thursday
4918678 if that were the case the closer the remnants would come to us the better chance to us to get very beneficial rainfall
4918679 i could not buy a flat in bombay because i am a muslim if shabana azmi and javed akhtar cannot buy a flat because of their religion what are we talking about the same happened to actor saif ali khan
4918680 indian muslims are in a safer place because the indian muslim has a stake and space in indian democracy its a very huge thing that we are a part of a democracy and indian muslims can aspire to become a shah rukh khan or an irfan pathan or the president of india and that makes the muslims far more hopeful and far less in despair than in other parts of the world
4918681 politicians promote a stereotypical image of the muslim community they dont allow moderate liberal muslim voices to be heard whether it is atal bihari vajpayee whether it is indira gandhi whether it is anybody the minute it is a muslim question you will get the dariwarala s and only all the maulvi s to speak
4918682 the polity is unfair to muslims so what happens is that only token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed as the
4918683 what was your biggest moral failure and what was americas
4918684 is there evil and what should we do about it
4918685 i am only one but i am one i cannot do everything but i can do something and that which i can do by the grace of god i will do
4918686 on its face the moa is patently illegal under our present laws
4918687 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4918688 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
4918689 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
4918690 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq
4918691 with games being held in beijing china finally comes of age
4918692 the pennhurst story was and continues to be about failing to recognize the worth of people and places that whether we like or it not defines us
4918693 and all of a sudden one day we told them you cant do that anymore
4918694 people really believed that people with mental retardation had no feelings so they werent bothered by being naked in a room with 100 other naked people
4918695 its really odd what we are able to justify once we divorce ourselves from people
4918696 when we dehumanize and write off a segment of our society and render them non people we can get away with a lot of horrible things
4918697 it is a problem if we dont recall the mistakes we made as a society
4918698 in my judgment the state was derelict in letting this go on for decades
4918699 it might be far easier for a developer to retrofit and not tear them down
4918700 a restored pennhurst campus holds tremendous promise economically and environmentally that far outweighs those to be gained by tearing everything down and throwing up houses or a big box store
4918701 its part of our job to make sure people know what they have and what they stand to lose
4918702 i wanted to win a gold but i gave it my best shot and im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4918703 most of us girls we have to stop our sport so we can start a family but for her to have a family and still get back in and win the silver medal is just absolutely incredible
4918704 ive done a lot of cool things and met really great people
4918705 there would be a breeze and then our whole classroom would smell like tobacco
4918706 i would always say grandma smoking is going to kill you and just annoy her so bad
4918707 hes positive and passionate but not earnest or pollyanna about it
4918708 its very ironic that the durham bulls ballpark in the historic tobacco district is smoke free
4918709 but we saw these kids hanging around the mascot and their parents smoking all around them and there was something wrong about that
4918710 if you get there you get there if you dont you dont
4918711 dude i know whats in your head you want the gold would you like to skate in the olympics one day
4918712 i really like this home competition because all our friends are here

4918749 i think the main thing the scrimmage did was getting the jitterbugs out
4918750 i think it was good for them and it was good for us it gives the coaches a chance to do a dress rehearsal before the first game
4918751 we still have some defensive positions that are wide open right now
4918752 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4918753 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4918754 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4918755 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4918756 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4918757 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event

4918789 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4918790 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
4918791 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
4918792 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
4918793 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
4918794 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

4918809 just transact the business which is the business of supporting a child
4918810 to get sidelined into personal or marital issues and keep the conversation always and only on the children
4918811 remember that just because someone was not a very good spouse a child still deserves to get to love their parent

4918829 i went to israel on a skateboard trip four years ago and i met arthur rashkovan an israeli pro skater who started the group surfing 4 peace
4918830 at that time he brought 10 surfboards into gaza and has now decided to up the ante and bring in 22 more as a peace offering between the two surfing communities
4918831 we werent humanitarian workers or journalists we were just young guys with a camera
4918832 but we were very lucky and we ended up meeting with a retired general in the israel army who got us military visas
4918833 edward chase the director of photography and i got a ride down to the border from rashkovan
4918834 as we approached the border rashkovan said i want you to take down these numbers before you go
4918835 the main problem was that the israel navy was concerned that the surfboards constitute as a security threat
4918836 but we were saying that you want these young males participating in recreation as opposed to picking up rifles
4918837 this police officer approached us and then did this whistle thing and all the hamas officers with machine guns started crowding around and pointing to our cameras
4918838 i think he understood english and was just seeing what we would say
4918839 admittedly our purpose of making a documentary about surfers did sound ridiculous and after five minutes he realized that we were far too dumb to be any intelligence agents
4918840 the officer got a huge smile on his face and said welcome to gaza have you had a nice day

4918899 while i would not trade the freedom of this time
4918900 one of those things i long for is the decency of humanity maybe im just daft or something but i find the way that we as humans treat each other is really starting to bother me more and more the older you get the more you see the fa ade of humanity that i once clung to is slowly chipping away and i feel like a child that has lost its security blanket and lost isnt even a strong enough word stolen seems more fitting its just that my heart cries out day after day for something different and better i understand what you man when you say that god has put us here to be the difference in this world but sometimes i wonder if it even makes a difference i know that it does but i am jarred by the growing distance between us as humans it makes me think of babel and how the people of the earth were forcibly ripped from one another but today even with all the ways we as humans can talk it seems that we are growing further apart in heart even families now seem more like fragments or ill fitting puzzle pieces i just want to serve the world for even as hard as my life has been and as down as i get sometimes i have been very blessed i just want others to know that they can have the same thing that they dont have to be miserable that they dont have to settle they can make the world and their life a better place but no matter how much i try to come to terms with reality there is this small spark in me that will not be quieted
4918901 will you please let me know so i can schedule you for show and tell

4918905 prior to 9 11 i was living the good life working in the city and was fairly liberal in my views

4918907 we need to remember and honor those who lost their lives at the world trade center
4918908 not just once a year but always and forever showing gerards photography which commemorates new york city on such a personal level is just one way we can demonstrate our love and concern for all those who were lost on 9 11

4918920 for on what i shall from now on call the post kantian view we are only entitled to hold someone responsible for his actions if it is true of him or her that he or she could have done other than he or she in fact did and could have chosen other than he or she in fact chose from any aristotelian point of view this appears very odd surely the aristotelian will say it is a mark of the supremely good person that his or her character has been so formed by training in and exercise of the virtues that he or she often could not do or be other than virtuous in his or her choices and actions we strive if we aspire to be good to be moved by the possession of good reasons to good actions there is a causal chain stretching back from each good action far into our moral and psychological past by contrast on the post kantian view there must be as we have seen a decisive break in the chain of causes and reasons underlying this post kantian view is the perfectly correct insight that if our capacities for guiding our lives rationally and virtuously depend upon those capacities having been causally shaped and sustained by parents teachers other moral exemplars a variety of challenges and opportunities and indeed native endowment then it is clearly the case that in their capacity for effective moral agency all men are not equal and this deeply offends that aspect of the post kantian view which reflects its protestant christian origins hence the post kantian view requires that the capacity for moral agency be detached from all other capacities moral agency begins to have an attenuated ghostly quality snip i am what my past has made me accountability as well as moral substance involves this kind of reference to the past for whether i ought to be held accountable now is always in part a matter of whether i did in the past take the appropriate steps to make myself what i ought to be now or not the famous example of the drunk man who may not be able to control his actions now but can be held to be accountable for them if it was in his power not to get drunk at the appropriate time needs to be generalized to cases extending over long periods of time indeed through the whole of each individual life the question that is of what it is in my power to do cannot be answered except by inspecting what may be the whole of my moral history take away that history and the identity that it presupposes and there is only the semblance of a moral agent left

4918940 im still going through a lot but im just trying to make it its been a big step for me
4918941 i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4918942 there were people saying it was about my contract and that i didnt want to play anymore i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing that put even more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me
4918943 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very i guess in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just felt like there was no outlet i just felt alone you know i was on the edge

4918996 t here are no military installations in the city of tskhinvali
4918997 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
4918998 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
4918999 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
4919000 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
4919001 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
4919002 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
4919003 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
4919004 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4919005 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4919006 i think in ways we are very far ahead of where we were last year
4919007 we know what we can do its not about getting lined up in the formation and running the play now its about getting into a better play if the play we called in the huddle isnt the one we like the best when we line up on the field
4919008 everyone was like who is this guy why are they taking him then in three years im in the pro bowl and everything its kind of like see they knew what they were doing
4919009 zelf ben ik ook altijd ziek van ellende dat mijn vakantie er weer op zit
4919010 ik kan dus niet teren op de zak van een ander
4919011 we moeten alles uit de kast halen om fraude op te sporen
4919012 werkgevers hebben niet alleen het recht maar ook de plicht om dat te doen waarom zou ik thuis bij ziekte wel controleerbaar zijn en tijdens de vakantie niet marokkanen en turken spelen soms de slachtofferrol maar zij stigmatiseren zichzelf door koploper te zijn met vakantieziekte niemand anders dan zijzelf zijn verantwoordelijk voor de statistieken
4919013 zo gaat t al j ren in die landen waar je voor een futiel bedrag een ziekteverklaring koopt bij de dokter
4919014 die gingen om de twee of drie jaar zes weken naar marokko maar velen bleven wel drie maanden weg als ik ze daarna op het werk sprak en zei dat ik ze lang niet had gezien was het antwoord steevast in marokko au in buik of au in rug
4919015 geen wonder dat werkgevers terughoudend zijn om deze mensen in dienst te nemen
4919016 als deze vakantiegangers in nederland willen wonen moeten zij zich aan onze regels houden geen uitzonderingen
4919017 we hebben ze destijds doorgegeven aan de detam maar die deed niets stigmatiseren de oplichters roepen dit over zichzelf af
4919018 i feel like credit card companies target us because we really have no financial awareness
4919019 were barely out of our homes barely having experiences as adults and they throw these things at us and they dont make you aware of what youre signing into
4919020 i think when those provisions in these agreements become public sometime relatively soon i think it will shock many people the kinds of relationships that some of these credit card companies have with the schools
4919021 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4919022 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4919023 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4919024 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4919025 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4919026 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4919027 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4919028 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4919029 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
4919030 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
4919031 i welcome this unprecedented step as long as the message of bible is never compromised with the biblical version which we have been reading in india is mostly the translations by european scholars for example the jerusalem bible poem however the indianised version is a new attempt by asian scholars and theologians
4919032 there are about seventy references to non christian texts in both the testaments about 30 scholars participated in making the commentary some of them have included indian scriptures while others have not
4919033 the debt has increased our risk of being held hostage by foreign lenders
4919034 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time
4919035 the financial condition of the u s is worse than advertised
4919036 its inevitable there will be some tax increases on fat cats like myself
4919037 but any idea youre going to solve most of this problem with taxes is not realistic
4919038 arthur laffer said to me addison im not a debt guy
4919039 but that doesnt take into account everything thats coming down the pike
4919040 this wouldnt be possible from winning by 1 100th of a second to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but a roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4919041 when you have a guy like that yelling at you
4919042 there is so much emotion going through my head so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mom
4919043 if someone say elijah wood or dominic monaghan ever shows any interest in me highly unlikely i am ditching robbie

4919046 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4919047 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4919048 she was into the bible obsessed with it they were going to show her the right way she got sucked into it
4919049 some people may say bad things about me even my own village is against me
4919050 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did
4919051 the day they took the marabout to prison it hurt me so much it was as if they had come to jail me
4919052 its my marabout that did this to me it forged me it allowed me to learn that i can overcome difficulty
4919053 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4919054 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4919055 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4919056 i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont
4919057 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
4919058 that was so unsatisfying i feel completely unfulfilled by that movie
4919059 icho hadnt been beaten for a long time so god its so frustrating to lose dugrenier fought so hard to have a 1 1 match against the olympic champion and multiple world champion were so proud of her super proud of her
4919060 its so hard not to have martine in the finals right now
4919061 i wont be on the side of the paedophilia i will be on the side of the children who are offended against and their families and i can think of no more heinous crime really than paedophilia
4919062 i think were comfortable going forward and really seeing what happens
4919063 this isnt the type of thing that has been sprung on us there has been a lot of discussions for years
4919064 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4919065 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4919066 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4919067 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4919068 vanmakt will now take a break for a couple of weeks before we start the tryout for the drummer spot we have 3 candidates at the moment and hopefully one of them got what it takes more about this when we have a decision

4919085 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4919086 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4919087 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4919088 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4919089 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4919090 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4919091 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4919092 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage
4919093 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement

4919103 in my early teens i would sit on the street corners and play gospel songs people would listen applaud pat me on the head and tell me youll be good one day but they never tipped when i played a blues song though they always tipped always thats when i knew i wanted to play the blues
4919104 the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
4919105 whats happening here in vietnam is the asia of 10 20 years ago
4919106 theres not much financial integration with the other asian markets at this point but it could damage the broader appetite for frontier markets
4919107 much of the central bank policy was driven by the governments agenda of promoting as much economic growth as possible while at the same time making sure that state run enterprises would play a bit part in the economy in the years to come
4919108 success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get
4919109 when i was growing up nasa united americans to a common purpose and inspired the world with accomplishments we are still proud of today nasa is an organization that impacts many facets of american life i believe nasa needs an inspirational vision for the 21st century my vision will build on the great goals set forth in recent years to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and ensure the fulfillment of nasas mission together we can ensure that nasa again reflects all that is best about our country and continue our nations preeminence in space
4919110 the exploration of space will go ahead whether we join in it or not and it is one of the great adventures of all time and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space we set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and used for the progress of all people
4919111 danger exists that americans may not know enough about science technology or mathematics to contribute significantly to or fully benefit from the knowledge based economy that is already taking shape around us
4919112 i have been married to one woman for 15 years and have vowed before god to remain with her for life

4919117 he developed the most extensive contacts of any area experts ive ever seen at the national archives
4919118 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4919119 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4919120 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4919121 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4919122 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4919123 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4919124 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4919125 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4919126 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4919127 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4919128 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4919129 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4919130 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4919131 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4919132 auf dem podium nicht ganz so sch n war wie beim ersten mal
4919133 it had the most students and stories i was interested in
4919134 it wasnt necessarily the town itself or the school itself i was looking for subjects that would surprise me people who seemed one way but had attributes that were unexpected i was also looking for students with strong story lines people who wanted to achieve something during their senior year despite what ever odds there were
4919135 its one thing to agree to be the subject of a movie
4919136 its still another thing to actually have your life filmed i think the toughest part is being able to capture those raw and intimate and spontaneous moments and not miss them and to make these teenagers comfortable on camera and let them bring you into their lives and tell you whats happening so you dont miss things
4919137 and when you see students listening on one end of the conversation youre seeing reaction shots from other phone calls we just cut to a shot of them listening but the audio is all real
4919138 i felt that the inner lives of teenagers are very important
4919139 there is a lot of fantasy and wishful thinking going on at that age normally in documentaries the only way to express that is through the talking head describing it i wanted to visualize what they were feeling and thinking because its a fantasy or in some cases a nightmare the only way to do that i felt was through animation
4919140 hes leaving oct 2 from what i understand i have mixed feelings hes here to serve our country as a mother its hard its difficult your child leaving
4919141 youre the latest band of brothers miles away from home making this happen in the best way you can
4919142 you and they represent the finest qualities of our sons and daughters
4919143 troop c 2nd squadron 106th calvary was reactivated in november 2005 during the past three years charlie troop has successfully completed the transition from a light infantry company to a dismounted reconnaissance cavalry troop this will mark the first deployment of c troop proper since world war ii during which the 106th participated in all major european campaigns from normandy to austria
4919144 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4919145 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4919146 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4919147 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4919148 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4919149 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4919150 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4919151 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4919152 weve got enough long term debt to choke a horse
4919153 besides those first four plays last week weve sustained drives and we havent really faltered that much we havent scored a touchdown yet the ones
4919154 you want to get points you dont want to turn the ball over in the red zone and we havent done that
4919155 we got some critical third downs some good checks we moved the ball nicely we just have to punch it in for seven well figure it out
4919156 well game plan next week and put some points on the board
4919157 we havent had a lot of big plays and then what has happened is we havent really executed in the red zone were having 16 play 12 play 14 play drives and moving the ball and not turning it over
4919158 weve got to be a little sharper when we get in that scoring zone
4919159 last week was a little bit of a storm at the beginning of the game
4919160 we got through it and we had a nice drive but we gave them 14 points you never want to turn the ball over
4919161 this week we had a good 11 play drive on the first drive that resulted in a punt but the next drive resulted in a field goal and that was a 16 17 play drive that started deep in our territory we took it into their territory and took some time off the clock
4919162 we just need to score touchdowns instead of field goals
4919163 you have to remind yourself its the preseason it matters but it doesnt matter you take it as it is
4919164 they say when a bad play happens a corner has to have a bad memory but when a good play happens you just forget about it and continue to work
4919165 they didnt panic even though we had a couple of situations they had two big runs early but you hang in there and dont give up touchdowns
4919166 that was obviously the biggest play of the game and probably a 10 point turnaround
4919167 i think we have some room for improvement you can look at the big runs and thats all they had you can look at it and say we didnt give up seven points and thats a good thing but we cant have those they probably had 100 yards on seven or eight carries
4919168 thats one thing we cant have in the regular season so we just want to learn from it and continue to work i think those things can be fixed so it wont be a problem
4919169 the corners made good breaks on the ball and forced the tip they were just in the air and i came up and scooped it out we work on that in practice every day everybody getting to the ball it just showed off what we do in practice
4919170 we werent going where we were supposed to there were big holes and turner weve seen that before we saw that movie its the same thing when you dont go the right direction with him
4919171 we caught him both times this time three years ago we couldnt catch him
4919172 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4919173 answering that question with speficity is above my pay grade
4919174 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4919175 deze jongens waren fantastisch zij hebben mijn droom mogelijk gemaakt zonder hen was het niet gelukt
4919176 alles bij elkaar van de race met eenhonderdste van een seconde verschil tot aan het wereldrecord van vandaag het is een geweldige ervaring en iets dat me altijd zal bijblijven ik wilde iets doen dat nog nooit iemand anders had gepresteerd dat is gelukt
4919177 het enige wat ik nu even wil is naar mijn moeder toe
4919178 las instituciones de los pueblos no son sino la expresi n de sus ideas sobre el bien com n y los signos exteriores que se adoptan por los gobiernos son el nico lenguaje propio para explicar a la multitud los principios que los animan
4919179 la patria no hace al soldado para que la deshonre con sus cr menes ni le da armas para que comenta la bajeza de abusar de estas ventajas ofendiendo a los ciudadanos con cuyo sacrificio se sostiene las penas aqu establecidas y las que se dictasen seg n la ley ser n aplicadas irremisiblemente sea honrado quien no quiera sufrirlas la patria no es abrigadora de cr menes
4919180 cada gota de sangre americana que se vierte por nuestros disgustos me llega al coraz n no tengo m s pretensiones que la felicidad de la patria mi sable jam s se sacar de la vaina por opiniones pol ticas como stas no sean a favor de los espa oles y de su dependencia
4919181 todos abominan de san mart n y no ven en l m s que a un enemigo de la sociedad desde que se ha resistido a tomar parte de las guerras civiles y ha impedido el avance de sus tropas
4919182 ud me reconvendr por no concluir la obra empezada usted tiene raz n pero m s tengo yo cr ame amigo ya estoy cansado de que me llamen tirano que en todas partes quiero ser rey emperador y hasta demonio por otra parte mi salud est muy deteriorada el temperamento de este pa s me lleva a la tumba en fin mi juventud fue sacrificada al servicio de los espa oles y mi edad media al de mi patria creo que tengo el derecho de disponer de mi vejez
4919183 suponiendo que la suerte de las armas me fuese favorable en la guerra civil yo habr a tenido que llorar la victoria con los mismos vencidos
4919184 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4919185 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4919186 up the western portion of the florida peninsula in a few days
4919187 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4919188 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4919189 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4919190 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4919191 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4919192 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4919193 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4919194 i dont really have anything that i want to talk about i was too busy with work to come up with an agenda
4919195 a view of scenery of any kind whether consisting of land water cloud or anything else
4919196 the deltas stress education and self esteem for our young ladies the alphas stress education and strong leadership for our young men
4919197 they are giving back to a community that has been so neglected
4919198 i can talk to miss pam about anything and we have a lot of fun
4919199 like a bright light anytime im by myself i can call on him
4919200 energetic cool and amazing shes giving me confidence and teaching me to be more open
4919201 but remember were not here with you for the glory but to give back so that one day you can give back too giving back thats what its all about
4919202 were looking for adults who have the time and interest and the desire to help a child
4919203 but while they prate of economic laws men and women are starving
4919204 we must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature they are made by human beings
4919205 man is a credulous animal and must believe something in the absence of good grounds for belief he will be satisfied with bad ones
4919206 well he entered the game still listed as a tri starter but he is so far removed from this contest he might as well be playing fullback
4919207 aveti grija cum va comportati ca poate va lasam cu vechiturile
4919208 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
4919209 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
4919210 the maze was the closest ive ever come to hell on earth
4919211 we were one of the first ones in there and the place was just a complete mess and had been torn apart by rioting it seemed if anything wasnt on fire it had already been reduced to ash
4919212 it looked more like a pow camp from some war film rather than how youd imagine a prison with these little tin huts that the prisoners lived in and which theyd razed after setting fire to their mattresses
4919213 there was just this terrible tension not knowing when something might happen which meant wed be absolutely knackered standing around all day while the prisoners just lazed around
4919214 so being welsh we decided to bang on the fences with our batons and sing a bit of maxs greatest hits or well keep a welcome in the hillside as loud as we could to make sure come the morning theyd be as tired as us
4919215 i can remember it really got to them and theyd shout
4919216 its funny this urgent call came over the radio saying that the trouble must be starting again because there was this terrible din coming from one of the compounds
4919217 they had a point mind our voices werent exactly great just because youre welsh doesnt necessarily mean youre good at close harmony singing you know
4919218 one things for sure we were the real last choir standing back then
4919219 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4919220 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4919221 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4919222 when you work really hard and give your all and you lose it hurts deitchler told the star tribunes rachel blount
4919223 it will motivate me to work harder than a lot of people and find a way to be the best
4919224 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mom
4919225 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4919226 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honor to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4919227 sullivan came back at the end but i think at the end of a long competition we are all a little tired right now
4919228 in the first 20m i noticed dara torres beside me
4919229 my coach told me the last 10 metres would decide the results
4919230 im thinking i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4919231 ayokong humingi ng tulong kasi alam kong wala din makakatulong sa kin
4919232 anyhoo i did a lot of updating dito sa blog ko im planning to upgrade my wordpress para kasing nahuhuli na ko sa mga bagay di ko din magamit yung mga lumalabas na magagandang plugins for wordpress kaya nakakabanas haha
4919233 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4919234 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4919235 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4919236 haha pictures on my multiply the whole day we did pretty much nothing iloveit no lessons thought and feeling for the month of august
4919237 did you choose this course through your own will or because your parents want this course for you
4919238 doesnt support people who hide their iphones natural beauty with cases
4919239 more than 61 of arizona prosecutors who ask jurors if they watch forensic crime tv shows feel jurors seem to believe the shows are mostly true
4919240 88 of prosecutors felt that judges rarely address the issue of overcoming the csi effect
4919241 most judges think its silly i even address these questions in voir dire
4919242 look beyond incarceration for alternative policies that not only may be able to accomplish the important task of protecting public safety but may do so more efficiently and more effectively
4919243 top to bottom restructuring of the nations criminal justice systems
4919244 to ensure that offenders who are likeliest to become sober citizens enter treatment that they stay there long enough and that they maintain their sobriety
4919245 hey we didnt start that stupid fight why should we approach and make up with you
4919246 if you have a right product attracting the best of talent is not very difficult
4919247 and if the film in question is the adaptation of henrik ibsens master builder and directed by award winning director k p kumaran its a cake walk
4919248 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4919249 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4919250 its unfortunate that only when you make a serious film are you taken seriously
4919251 you can only move destiny with hard work after all god is the greatest scriptwriter
4919252 such titles dont matter why chase something thats transitory our fortunes change every friday
4919253 darling its unfortunate that only when you make a serious film are you taken seriously its a shame that my films that have been made for countless viewers are not seen to be in the same league as those made for a few critics or intellectuals
4919254 im edgy before a release but i can relax now
4919255 my son has already seen half the world he would have learnt far more from travelling than at school it is such an eye opener widens your horizon
4919256 hes a complete entertainer who connects with the audience the way big b did in the 80s and the way govinda did people relate to him
4919257 theres no tension or desperation is his persona theres a cosmopolitan touch even when hes playing a rustic he is intelligent and street sharp but not an intellectual fun but not a joker hero but not heroic strong but not about machismo hes like a pack of assorted biscuits a sum of many parts
4919258 its a paternalistic rustic self deprecatory and playful male aura which is endearing
4919259 but he is growing more and more confident as a performer directors will come up with interesting ideas for him
4919260 sharks and treasures and 80 per cent of it has been shot under water
4919261 it is the cinema of the underdog like manmohan desais films where amitabh is a coolie a waiter
4919262 hers is the kind of madonna whore screen presence that can fell grown men to their knees
4919263 hers is the kind of madonna whore screen presence that can fell grown men to their knees
4919264 thats something a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop
4919265 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4919266 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4919267 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way it treats its animals
4919268 one of the most dangerous things that can happen to a child is to kill or torture an animal and get away with it
4919269 a 1997 survey of 50 out the largest shelters for battered women in the united states found that 85 of women and 63 of children entering these shelters discussed incidents of pet abuse in the family
4919270 provides punishment ranging in severity from a fine to five years in prison for the display of acts of cruelty and sexual abuse intended for commerce crush videos generally depict women in stiletto heels stepping on small animals such as kittens and rodents
4919271 anyone who has accustomed himself to regard the life of any living creature as worthless is in danger of arriving also at the idea of worthless human lives
4919272 t he technology for dna profiling and the methods for estimating population frequencies and related statistics have progressed to the point where the reliability and validity of properly collected and analyzed dna data should not be in doubt
4919273 anyone who has accustomed himself to regard the life of any living creature as worthless is in danger of arriving also at the idea of worthless human lives
4919274 we thus judge that if one died for all then all died
4919275 je pensais quil y aurait des p tards des feux dartifice chinois de la nourriture chinoise il ny a rien
4919276 cela montre bien que ce pays ne respecte pas les droits de lhomme

4919278 cest une surprise o est cette pollution dont la presse nous a tant parl le ciel est bleu ce ne pourrait pas tre mieux
4919279 even though it was tough i think it was probably worth it for me as a coach i really do because it helped me grow as a coach
4919280 i think i learned a lot about going from teaching professionals to teaching kids that are just coming out of high school and into college just how much more detailed you have to be in coaching young men and being around them
4919281 what we want to do is not boggle the kids minds with another scheme
4919282 fundamentals are very very critical ive learned through good and bad experiences that its not about how much defense a defense has its how well they play the fundamentals in that defense
4919283 i had moved from corner to safety to outside linebacker so i was kind of moving closer to the line of scrimmage so i figured by then i wasnt going to be an nfl corner withers said
4919284 and i was always intrigued with xs and os and that kind of stuff was always doodling plays and schemes so coaching made sense
4919285 ok ricardo i hear ya so how do i start succeeding whats the secret
4919286 played for several years off broadway with a whos who of
4919287 its not steamy enough they took all the good part of a movie
4919288 it shall be the duty of the district attorney not only to prosecute all crimes committed within his jurisdiction but to defend with equal vigor the rights and privileges of all its citizens

4919309 the way things are going with the economy worries me
4919310 the cost of food keeps going up but our garden has helped us save 50 a month
4919311 what we get from that is an incredible help for our budget
4919312 when i ran out of space i did some herbs and strawberries in pots on the patio
4919313 the food tastes a lot fresher because you can go out to your garden right before dinner pull carrots and eat them that night
4919314 i didnt want to bend because i am compromised with back and neck issues
4919315 large containers dont require as much watering so they are less wear and tear on the grower
4919316 im putting up soups ill freeze things in bags because they lay flat and stack better
4919317 we decided to cut corners and make it through by putting in our own garden
4919318 two pepper plants yielded six to 10 bell peppers thirty radish seeds gave us 30 radishes the leaf lettuce is the best thing we did we havent had to buy it once

4919321 i live in a log house with a cathedral ceiling
4919322 ive been to the sale ever since they started here many years ago
4919323 last year we got rained out we still did well
4919324 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs
4919325 i can never quite tell if the defeatists are conservative satirists poking fun at the left or simply retards or both retarded satire perhaps

4919329 iraq bringing benzene and gasoline from outside its a joke
4919330 we need equipment we need instruments we need a lot of technical help
4919331 these deals themselves are not likely to be hugely lucrative
4919332 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4919333 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4919334 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4919335 people have less time so their garden projects have changed over time convenience time saving factors less mess
4919336 the peat moss comes from canada it doesnt come here magically it has to come by truck or on the train
4919337 we usually call it artificial growth substrate it doesnt contain any mineral soil in general now
4919338 it has been an effort of the whole parish and the culmination of six or seven years of work
4919339 we have a growing community a committed group of parents and a whole group of parishioners enthusiastic about a grade school everything came together at the right time
4919340 now a whole new group will have christ at the center of all of their classes
4919341 it will help parents raise their children in the faith and it is a statement of hope in the future batavia is a vibrant city and its an opportunity to say that we want to be a part of that
4919342 its been a blessing to be able to meet all the parents
4919343 the way things are going with the economy worries me
4919344 the cost of food keeps going up but our garden has helped us save 50 a month
4919345 what we get from that is an incredible help for our budget
4919346 when i ran out of space i did some herbs and strawberries in pots on the patio

4919349 large containers dont require as much watering so they are less wear and tear on the grower
4919350 im putting up soups ill freeze things in bags because they lay flat and stack better
4919351 we decided to cut corners and make it through by putting in our own garden
4919352 two pepper plants yielded six to 10 bell peppers thirty radish seeds gave us 30 radishes the leaf lettuce is the best thing we did we havent had to buy it once
4919353 the garden needs one inch of water once a week
4919354 i recommend having two gauges one to measure rainfall and the other to register your watering
4919355 there are so many things going on in the park people will be stopping here
4919356 having the show for two days will make a change i see the show growing it makes a real difference when you dont have to pack up after just one day
4919357 i think we still did well last year despite the rain and i wanted to come back
4919358 but the crafting business is down a bit people are buying gas for their cars rather than trinkets
4919359 its hard to fathom when someone beats you by one one hundredth
4919360 he was a year older than me but i ran with him from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1999
4919361 when i heard that he made the olympic team i made arrangements for a hotel airplane ticket and tickets to his event one other track event and several mens basketball games
4919362 i thought it would be cool to see someone i ran with starting in the fifth grade compete in the olympics and ive never been to china so i thought why not
4919363 i havent seen him since the spring of 1999 and have only talked to him on facebook
4919364 but i discovered that i am better at poker than i was at running
4919365 i am a spontaneous person i like to do a lot of unusual things and since i am a poker player i dont have to report to anyone
4919366 so my friends are not at all surprised that i decided to go to china for eight or nine days to watch jorge run in the olympics
4919367 we thought wouldnt it be nice if every kid in hanover park marched with their team or organization and if theyre not marching then they have plenty of options to choose from to get involved
4919368 weve been practicing our parade show at band camp but this is our first real parade this year and were ready to go
4919369 it gave them a wonderful foundation while building their confidence and boosting their self esteem and yet a lot of children dont have this
4919370 weve got a really young community and yet with seven school districts and no high school in the village were looking for ways to come together
4919371 this is one way for us to look ahead and stay progressive about our future
4919372 hes leaving oct 2 from what i understand i have mixed feelings hes here to serve our country as a mother its hard its difficult your child leaving
4919373 youre the latest band of brothers miles away from home making this happen in the best way you can
4919374 you and they represent the finest qualities of our sons and daughters
4919375 troop c 2nd squadron 106th calvary was reactivated in november 2005 during the past three years charlie troop has successfully completed the transition from a light infantry company to a dismounted reconnaissance cavalry troop this will mark the first deployment of c troop proper since world war ii during which the 106th participated in all major european campaigns from normandy to austria
4919376 i liked having the opportunity of being able to sample the different theater companies in town
4919377 the next two saturdays theres going to be more artists out here
4919378 this is great were getting a lot of positive feedback
4919379 its a very different feel from what im normally used to but it gets us actors closer to the audience
4919380 you can interact more it really enhanced the experience for myself and the audience as well
4919381 its good on a lot of levels it gets people downtown the plays are the right length
4919382 i live in a log house with a cathedral ceiling
4919383 ive been to the sale ever since they started here many years ago
4919384 last year we got rained out we still did well
4919385 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4919386 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4919387 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
4919388 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
4919389 there were a lot of things to appreciate in the performance tonight in that we didnt just pack it in and say lets go home
4919390 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
4919391 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
4919392 we all wanted to see him in a different uniform a new place and to see how he reacted
4919393 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
4919394 i dont have one yet but i think ill build one just for that
4919395 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4919396 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4919397 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4919398 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4919399 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4919400 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4919401 all he talked about was his family and this city
4919402 we have to make sure he doesnt overexert himself so he can heal properly
4919403 jackson will be well taken care of at our home
4919404 we have a fenced in backyard baskets of toys treats and another boston terrier for him to play with he will have everything that he needs
4919405 we all hope that jackson continues to progress in his recuperation and that he has a long happy and healthy dog life
4919406 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4919407 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4919408 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4919409 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4919410 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4919411 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4919412 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4919413 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4919414 the canal is not going to be the panacea for new york but it is part of the equation for the upstate economy
4919415 on our first trip in 1990 the locks were strictly commercial and it was really rough
4919416 some people would buy big bales of hay and tie them to the side of their boats to keep the boat from being swallowed up by the big holes in the canal wall
4919417 but it has improved considerably now there are barbecues picnic tables theres tie ups i cant believe how beautiful it is
4919418 we all know the history and significance of the erie canal but its really no longer a transportation facility
4919419 new yorks port is no longer dependent on the river system at all and you can only really justify public investment going forward not because something has a history
4919420 why should the people of new york subsidize yacht owners
4919421 obviously its important to the state for tourism and we dont want to see anything happen to the canal
4919422 but we dont think it should be maintained with money from thruway tolls
4919423 it had the most students and stories i was interested in
4919424 it wasnt necessarily the town itself or the school itself i was looking for subjects that would surprise me people who seemed one way but had attributes that were unexpected i was also looking for students with strong story lines people who wanted to achieve something during their senior year despite what ever odds there were
4919425 its one thing to agree to be the subject of a movie
4919426 its still another thing to actually have your life filmed i think the toughest part is being able to capture those raw and intimate and spontaneous moments and not miss them and to make these teenagers comfortable on camera and let them bring you into their lives and tell you whats happening so you dont miss things
4919427 and when you see students listening on one end of the conversation youre seeing reaction shots from other phone calls we just cut to a shot of them listening but the audio is all real
4919428 i felt that the inner lives of teenagers are very important
4919429 there is a lot of fantasy and wishful thinking going on at that age normally in documentaries the only way to express that is through the talking head describing it i wanted to visualize what they were feeling and thinking because its a fantasy or in some cases a nightmare the only way to do that i felt was through animation
4919430 gods gift of love to us is free were just sharing his love in this way
4919431 inasmuch as you have done this to the least of these my brothers you have done it to me
4919432 sell your possessions and give them to the poor and then come follow me
4919433 because the soil is already warm they tend to germinate faster and take off faster rather than in the spring when the soil is cool
4919434 you can leave them in the ground after a frost
4919435 they store sugar better in the fall you get much sweeter beets in fall than summer
4919436 middle class families will see their taxes cut and no family making less than 250 000 will see their taxes increase
4919437 if we strive to be the best we can be each day we can do some wonderful things on this earth
4919438 its interesting the athletes who endure its not only the racking up of medals its the image you project
4919439 michelle kwan won no olympic gold medals but is an icon in the united states because of the way she carried herself and figure skating is a widely exposed sport
4919440 she is a much more beloved athlete than carl lewis ever was in the united states
4919441 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now
4919442 weve got enough long term debt to choke a horse
4919443 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4919444 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4919445 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4919446 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4919447 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4919448 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4919449 a matter of time before external hand behind the bomb blasts is established
4919450 but we all know that somewhere at the top the local terror groups are actively linked with the let huji as well as pakistans isi it is only a matter of time before the external hand behind the bomb blasts in ahmedabad and possibly some other parts of the country is established
4919451 we also know who stole the cars who brought these to vapi and vadodara and who finally took them to ahmedabad javed sheikh being an expert driver was given the responsibility of the cars
4919452 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4919453 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4919454 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4919455 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4919456 your coordinates and regional characteristics such as the average weather cycle cloud cover surface albedo and the orientation and area of your solar array
4919457 do you think the massive peaceful turnout will have any positive effect on the indian government
4919458 you know gandhiji did not use arms against the british he used non violence to mobilize people is non violence more effective than violence in getting azadi
4919459 i stayed with a bihari labourer who also works for us but two people were killed near by and police picked me for questioning the labourer kept pleading them to let me off but they didnt listen to him as a kashmiri you are always under suspicion
4919460 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4919461 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4919462 the one sided propaganda of the official chinese media is having the effect of stirring up inter ethnic animosity and aggravating an already tense situation this is extremely detrimental to the long term goal of safeguarding national unity
4919463 in keeping with the situation nor is it beneficial to the chinese governments image
4919464 as the chinese government is committed to integrating into the international community we maintain that it should display a style of governing that conforms to the standards of modern civilization
4919465 this deterioration indicates that there are serious mistakes in the work that has been done with regard to tibet the relevant government departments must conscientiously reflect upon this matter examine their failures and fundamentally change the failed nationality policies
4919466 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
4919467 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
4919468 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
4919469 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
4919470 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
4919471 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
4919472 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
4919473 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
4919474 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
4919475 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
4919476 as long as they are not found guilty they remain only accused and there is nothing authorities can do about the couple
4919477 i would call it the most valuable piece of real estate in the world right now
4919478 we will choose a company that has a very good reputation in china
4919479 kane has negotiated right of first refusal deal speak for dibs on 65 undeveloped acres east of the intersection
4919480 i am a therapist and here is how it is
4919481 over the past 30 years they have sought to impose a number of embargoes against iran in an attempt to block the path of our progress all those sanctions turned the country into a nuclear power
4919482 we are now the best bigfoot trackers in the world
4919483 were the best bigfoot trackers in the world we tracked him we got him
4919484 hmmm what does this mean does it mean yes or does it mean no donno but its a mystery which creates a history god knows but we still donno why people say hmmm be clear in what ever you say say it no if you dont want to say yes but be sure as hmmm for you means just delaying the things but it might create a lot of hopes and misconception in mind of others which in future if doesnt come true hurt him a lot well was is hmm lets see might be later means actually its nothing but the misconception that one has in our mind and due to which we creates a false hope for others why should we do such thing when we are not sure we create a problem for other isnt that bad think now we say that saying no might hurt others but do you thing giving false hopes by saying hmmm lets see might be later would not hurt him if you think so than its the worst misconception that you have you think he will forget but no he wont tell you and infact you forget but thats the worst part for him which hurts him later leave the habit dear think on it when you cant give happiness to other why to give false hopes and make him rise on the top of mountain to throw him upside down from top so that he cant ever get up gain think think on it
4919485 were very proud of this milestone and the record time in which we reached 100 000 registrations
4919486 we recognize people have a choice when registering a domain name well continue to ensure we offer products and services our customers want
4919487 we are an enigma in todays internet crazed world the company is profitable and has a reliable revenue stream with tremendous growth potential
4919488 these new developments with respect to online casinos projects and computer usage will double our output for sure
4919489 on more than just one level as a reporter its a great story and as a citizen of dibello zeno borough i know that my neighbors will still have their jobs one has to realize that this will only strengthen the local economy and drive new business to our area these factors are key to economic survival and to my fellow citizens as we move forward in the next few years
4919490 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
4919491 were proud to announce news that our online casinos company has devised new algorithms and computer models for enhanced online casinos analysis
4919492 and as a result were expecting nearly double last quarters profits in the coming months
4919493 and were happy to also announce our own software team has developed important online casinos production algorithms that will boost our profits dramaticly
4919494 we chose to use perl in our online casinos text studies because it is a lingual programming language
4919495 and also because it is easy to combine with other programming languages perl is easily installed on linux platforms and modules can be compiled that allow us to communicate with database technologies
4919496 with increased profits well be able to hire more employees and really grow our business
4919497 mostly because well need time to train these employees to be as effective online casinos producers as possible
4919498 id like to personally thank jeanna nanton and nina soyars for the work theyve done on this project
4919499 without their efforts our company would need be able to meet the demands of the burgeoning consumer market when demand increases the only way to provide for this change is an increase in technology most importantly we wont be laying anyone off all current employees in our tessie vallas county plant and all online casinos project employees will be guaranteed employment for 3 years
4919500 there is still a significant amount of cdo collateralised debt obligation instruments out there that are still to be brought to account
4919501 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion us dollars of that to come to account
4919502 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4919503 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4919504 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4919505 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4919506 those banks that have taken a more cautious or a more prudent approach in their lending are seeing the benefits of that
4919507 the business is a good business but it does have a number of complex parts
4919508 when you look the funding requirements theres a significant capital injection that would have to be made in order to appropriately capitalise the entity
4919509 because the soil is already warm they tend to germinate faster and take off faster rather than in the spring when the soil is cool
4919510 you can leave them in the ground after a frost
4919511 they store sugar better in the fall you get much sweeter beets in fall than summer
4919512 kami selalu tampak dalam kendali dan saya kira gol kedua akan terjadi namun west brom bertahan sangat bagus dan kami kekurangan sedikit ketajaman di sekitar kotak penalti
4919513 kami tidak melakukan awal yang bagus kami mendapat satu atau dua kesempatan dibanding 15 atau 20 peluang mereka namun terus yakin kami bisa berkompetisi dalam liga ini jika kami bekerja keras seperti yang kami lakukan hari ini kami punya peluang
4919514 kami unggul pada babak kedua dan mengendalikan pertandingan kami mendapat peluang dan torres memanfaatkan kesempatanya ia pemain kunci yang bisa mengubah pertandingan
4919515 kami memenangi pertandingan dari fulham kami tidak akan tinggal diam
4919516 banyak kegembiraan di kota saat kami berada di sini untuk pertamakalinya dan kami punya sesuatu untuk dibangun
4919517 saya ingin melakukan sesuatu yang orang lain belum pernah lakukan dalam olahraga ini sejalan dengan tujuan saya untuk mengubah olahraga renang
4919518 hal yang terbaik dari ini semua adalah membuktikan bahwa tidak ada yang tidak mungkin
4919519 banyak orang berkata bahwa hal itu tidak mungkin dilakukan tetapi yang dibutuhkan hanyalah imajinasi itu adalah sesuatu yang saya pelajari
4919520 pertandingan ini seperti menaiki rollercoaster yang bergerak naik tetapi sangat menyenangkan sekali berada di dalamnya
4919521 semua orang sangat penting dalam tim saya tetapi anda membutuhkan pemain yang bisa membuat perbedaan dan hari ini moussa dembele membuatnya
4919522 ketika anda memiliki pemain dengan level seperti ini dan ofisial yang mengambil keputusan seperti yang kita lihat hari ini semua telah mengatakan jawabannya

4919527 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4919528 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4919529 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4919530 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4919531 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4919532 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4919533 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4919535 i think were going to have problems with crowd management but well figure that out
4919536 when you have an event like the nasher exhibition something as prominent as this it shows all of us that the arts can achieve a hugely prominent role on campus
4919537 the basic agreements do not determine the ceiling for the peacekeeping contingents
4919538 how long it will take i have already emphasized that it depends not only on us we are constantly facing problems created by the georgian side everything depends on how fast and efficiently these problems will be solved
4919539 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4919540 if you get there you get there if you dont you dont
4919541 dude i know whats in your head you want the gold would you like to skate in the olympics one day
4919542 i really like this home competition because all our friends are here
4919543 three events a day its too much for a little girl
4919544 when someone comes back voluntarily even years later they almost always arent prosecuted for desertion
4919545 our preference would have been for him to turn himself in but we dont advise people what to do
4919546 we can tell them what has happened to others in the same situation
4919547 id happily go to jail rather than shoot innocent iraqis or kill anyone
4919548 its always very difficult to say what will happen in any given case
4919549 ive done a lot of cool things and met really great people
4919550 there would be a breeze and then our whole classroom would smell like tobacco
4919551 i would always say grandma smoking is going to kill you and just annoy her so bad
4919552 hes positive and passionate but not earnest or pollyanna about it
4919553 its very ironic that the durham bulls ballpark in the historic tobacco district is smoke free
4919554 but we saw these kids hanging around the mascot and their parents smoking all around them and there was something wrong about that
4919555 i think mccain would be a better president because of his level of experience
4919556 even though id love to see an african american in office i just dont see obama as having enough experience
4919557 hes much more appealing when it comes to a brighter outlook and a better attitude
4919558 its infectious you finally have someone whos out there trying to pump you up and say good things
4919559 you have a number of democrats who are unsure about obama for a variety of reasons his race may be part of it also that hes new on the scene and there are all these rumors that are going around
4919560 obviously the message from the obama campaign is change and a new kind of politics
4919561 i wanted to send a message that change is not just words if you are going to say something you need to back it up
4919562 as much fun as you can have in a combat zone
4919563 pockets of iraq are humming along other sections not so much i think the government of iraq has to do things on its own you can only help them so much
4919564 we have to leave in a responsible manner that means playing hardball with the iraq government
4919565 the gospel does teach us about caring for our fellow man
4919566 were going to give the americans a good shake and hopefully keep phelpsy from getting his eighth gold
4919567 thats something a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop
4919568 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4919569 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4919570 we just bought a four pack of jones and we dont want them all do you want one
4919571 they have me doing the worst jobs that others dont want to do i feel that all they wish is to humiliate me and hurt my dignity so i will quit beef northwest its revenge because i fight for my rights ive always been the one who speaks out about the problems of harassment and intimidation that beef northwest targets against us workers my fellow workers are always scared of reprisals now the workers see what they are doing to me and i think this has an effect
4919572 this kind of claptrap idea is not a smart way to deal with immigration
4919573 this is a publicity stunt by ice to put a happy face to the brutal actions that have broken many families apart
4919574 initiative that all governments need to take forward to ensure that agricultural knowledge science and technology fulfils its potential to meet the development and sustainability goals of the reduction of hunger and poverty the improvement of rural livelihoods and human health and facilitating equitable socially environmentally and economically sustainable development
4919575 get your balls ready for where they need to go
4919576 in our organizing we talk about the work immigrants did in the 1930s to create the good jobs we have today
4919577 he had a real sense of himself as working class
4919578 he always said i am a worker not middle class like they say today
4919579 employers violate workers rights every time we try to organize
4919580 its the fear of being deported that makes people afraid
4919581 workers are being fired for no match but there hasnt been a no match letter sent in at least a year and a half
4919582 the workers are terrorized both immigrant and non immigrant and the employer gets off scot free
4919583 immigration is serious but its not that different from other things people are afraid of
4919584 if youre a 50 year old white woman or a 50 year old black woman its really hard to get a new job
4919585 people have to be willing to lose their jobs we dont lie to people we dont say the law is going to protect you
4919586 takes power away from the workers and gives it to the legal process which takes forever
4919587 better wages better benefits fewer injuries more rights and respect
4919588 word of mouth is very helpful the facts speak for themselves
4919589 a major turnaround in the militancy of the union in the last decade
4919590 for immigrants organizing a union is the only way to have a better life other than winning the lottery
4919591 we do not believe there should be any difference everyone deserves the same rights and respect at work
4919592 management was trying to play them off against each other
4919593 in organizing nonunion workers its easier to point that out it doesnt matter if the mexican workers are cleaning rooms with a toothbrush or the chinese workers are faster were all in the same boat
4919594 there is tension among different ethnic groups but with good organizing it goes away if management is winning the work force is divided if the union is winning the work force is united
4919595 were not for open borders and were not for building walls
4919596 were for immigration laws that protect the rights of workers both u s workers and immigrants as they come in thats not an easy position to explain
4919597 inherently provides employers with the opportunity to abuse and exploit workers
4919598 it gives employers the element of fear in their favor they say im risking myself to give you a job so you better stay quiet
4919599 as long as theres extreme poverty in latin america and other places people will go where the jobs are
4919600 people are not packing up and going back to their home countries
4919601 must ensure that the human rights of people who migrate are protected
4919602 its a new population of workers unions have to understand that their future is tied to immigrants when you protect the most vulnerable workers you protect everyone
4919603 we cant focus just on the interests of our members its just not sustainable anymore
4919604 hes a righthanded hitter specifically were going to face some pretty tough lefthanders pretty quickly hell be a guy that can help us either catching playing first base possibly third base and being a pinch hitter off the bench
4919605 primarily catching and dh ing and playing first which is primarily what he would do here
4919606 maybe a third base stint here or there primarily probably catch pinch hit maybe some first base in the right situation where wed give lance a little break or something but he swings a bat and is hitting well there we need another option there thats righthanded
4919607 you could draw a horizontal line from houston to jacksonville and from dallas to atlanta in between i 20 and i 10 and there would be as many football players in that area than any other area in the country
4919608 in most of the rest of the world college football is a game and they love it in the south its not a game its a way of life
4919609 the biggest city in the country is not producing football players
4919610 new york and philadelphia the two largest cities on the east coast have been perennial basketball hotbeds
4919611 the weather gives them a chance to be practicing be involved with football pretty much year round
4919612 i think that helps you dont see the basketball and some of those things hockey as prevalent down south as you do in the northeast
4919613 how am i going to survive there ive never seen snow ive never experienced a cold cold weather
4919614 it was like kansas south florida kansas south florida south floridas up and coming i was like im staying here that was a no brainer

4919616 ellen and portia came out and posed for pictures with ellens mom and their two dogs
4919617 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu
4919618 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4919619 my feelings for ellen overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian
4919620 that had never happened to me in my life where i saw somebody and experienced all of those things you hear about in songs and read about in poetry my knees were weak
4919621 i never would have thought my life would have turned out this way
4919622 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession he said noting that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite all the publicity over losing jobs to india china illegal immigration housing and credit problems and record oil prices we have sort of become a nation of whiners he said
4919623 a lot of this is psychological a lot of its psychological because i believe the fundamentals of our economy is still strong
4919624 are americans better off than they were eight years ago
4919625 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created i think we are better off overall if you look at the entire eight year period when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created the improvement in the economy et cetera

4919631 im so lonely thats okay its in my head and im not sad and just maybe im to blame from all ive heard im not sure
4919632 it helps us to belong to a community of kindred spirits who share our faith
4919633 now godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and clothing with these we shall be content but those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition
4919634 cross me once and ill forgive you cross me twice and it gets hard cross me three times and just remember im no christ
4919635 theyll know us by the t shirts that we wear theyll know us by the way we point and stare at anyone whose sin looks worse than ours who cannot hide the scars of this curse that we all bear theyll know us by our picket lines and signs theyll know us by the pride we hide behind like anyone on earth is living right and isnt that why jesus died not to make us think were right
4919636 tash is only another name for aslan all that old idea of us being right and the calormenes wrong is silly we know better now
4919637 when the united states started bombing the people of iraq and destroying that country i decided to visit the unitarian universalist church
4919638 i hate bush because he made us go into the war
4919639 im mean i dont give a shit about you and im a parasite
4919640 a ship in port is safe but that is not what ships are for sail out to sea and do new things
4919641 the commercial aired sunday during womens gymnastics and chevrolet proved capable of more restraint and good taste than our politicians have with regard to 9 11

4919645 if you ask me its all a scam i mean you can go to the dollar store and buy a pack of pencils for a buck and it will do the same no i take that back a better job then this twenty dollar anti squeak ball
4919646 well its real easy what you do is take a number two pencil make sure its a number two those china pens just dont work as good what you do is cover the pencil with some sort of lube ky works fine but makes sure you dont get any on the eraser thats the most important part
4919647 after you lube up the pencil shove it in his ass the whole thing
4919648 wow this seems like something youd see on 20 20 real scientific
4919649 oh its a good idea if you tie a string to the end of the pencil like a tampon that way it pulls out easier
4919650 and make sure you put the eraser end in first thats the key
4919651 and dont use the same pencil twice you dont want to cause any problems you know
4919652 well thanks for the tip you saved me a bunch of money
4919653 oh dont try putting like one of those big eraser the ones as big as your thumb and dont try to put a bunch of small ones in the ass of your dog either they just dont work like a 2 pencil
4919654 hold on i better write that down you said not the erasers as big as your thumb

4919670 i was working with the seniors guys going to college and derrick was able to pick up on things quicker than they did
4919671 he works very hard on his skills he works drills with his left hand and with his right hand and he works on his perimeter game
4919672 but he is a point i am sure that baylor envisions him playing alongside john wall but both are point guards
4919673 we dont have any super super super stars but we should be pretty strong at the bottom of the lineup
4919674 theres a lot of pressure of playing in the no 1 spot colleens had that pressure before
4919675 we had so many 5 4 matches last year that we couldnt get over the hump
4919676 i decided 25 years was enough this is my swan song
4919677 boxing is a lot of white men watching two black men beat each other up

4919682 where in that do i say they should get any special treatment its a comment that says they will be impacted
4919683 if i was the minister for the environment i would have made exactly the same comment which was that they would be impacted and they are impacted
4919684 my understanding is that he and his family rented a fairly dilapidated house while they were rebuilding their house
4919685 there is still a significant amount of cdo collateralised debt obligation instruments out there that are still to be brought to account
4919686 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion us dollars of that to come to account
4919687 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4919688 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4919689 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4919690 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4919691 those banks that have taken a more cautious or a more prudent approach in their lending are seeing the benefits of that
4919692 the business is a good business but it does have a number of complex parts
4919693 when you look the funding requirements theres a significant capital injection that would have to be made in order to appropriately capitalise the entity
4919694 all the things id like to do with my life
4919695 and the heavens opened and saved me from then on they have been my biggest influence
4919696 i just started thinking how cool the studio is and how much of a part of our sound it is
4919697 we have been evaluating the possibility of getting a satellite since some time ago logically we evaluate what is better for us concerning the image capture renting a service or counting on our own satellite
4919698 i had two marvelous years here and afterwards the club developed very well and now they are one of the best in europe

4919705 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4919706 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold
4919707 theres just too many factors going against it at this point for traders to get really enthused about it
4919708 you can almost call it quits for the bull market
4919709 as we move out of the summer months gold could recoup and move above 900 again but its going to be difficult
4919710 this is a very steep discount and now is probably a safe time to get in at a lower price than just a couple of weeks ago
4919711 im affected by the price of gas right now so im not in the market for gold
4919712 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out

4919721 there was a man who had two sons the younger one said to his father father give me my share of the estate so he divided his property between them
4919722 not long after that the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living
4919723 when he came to his senses he said how many of my fathers hired men have food to spare and here i am starving to death
4919724 but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him
4919725 the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you i am no longer worthy to be called your son
4919726 meanwhile the older son was in the field when he came near the house he heard music and dancing so he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on your brother has come he replied and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound
4919727 the older brother became angry and refused to go in
4919728 my son the father said you are always with me and everything i have is yours
4919729 though unstudied its possible that this hydrogen could serve as an energy source for pathogens in other areas of the body including the lungs and internal organs since the amount of hydrogen produced in the colon varies based on diet and since the researchers have shown that h pylori uses this hydrogen as an energy source something as simple as a diet change could affect virulence and persistence of this and other pathogens
4919730 in this difficult consumer environment we have continued to focus on tightly controlling all aspects of our business and our second quarter results show the benefits of our approach

4919758 looking further ahead what this opportunity with the waratahs provides is an appealing opportunity to be at home more frequently
4919759 with four children thats very important to me and my family
4919760 the travel demands over the past three seasons have been extensive
4919761 michaels been working hard with our forwards for some time now and weve seen the results in the waratahs set piece play and scrummaging in particular
4919762 during the super 14 michael has been a familiar face around the place so to know that weve got him full time now is a major coup for nsw rugby
4919763 it was behind the green a bit above the hole and it bounced really nicely towards the hole and straight in
4919764 what carl shot on friday was an indication of how the course is playing
4919765 a 64 might be good enough you just never know how the leaders are going to play
4919766 the way im playing hopefully i can get off to a good start again and come out with a hot putter im hitting the ball nicely ive just got to get the job done
4919767 i was a little disappointed with my putter but i thought i played really good and handled myself well
4919768 it was probably the worst score i could have shot i had so many chances i didnt convert
4919769 i think he mr barnett should get rid of steve
4919770 to have received a house for 30 to 50 a week i think compromises you and mr thomas should have known better

4919773 my understanding is that he and his family rented a fairly dilapidated house while they were rebuilding their house
4919774 other people rented similar houses on exactly the same conditions
4919775 he definitely wouldnt be out of place in origin definitely not
4919776 i think being named in this world cup squad is just a stepping stone for him now
4919777 he can take a lot of confidence out of that knowing that the selectors are fully aware of his abilities so hes just got to take it to the next step and keep growing as a footballer and im sure hes got a long rep future in front of him
4919778 id have to have words to him before the game maybe just ask him to be kind to me
4919779 hed certainly be very damaging and it would be pretty painful to see him in a sky blue jersey
4919780 hes just a freak and i love watching him play
4919781 obviously it was a tough week we had to address a few issues at the start of the week but full credit to the boys for the way they prepared for the game
4919782 we can certainly take some confidence out of that for this week

4919791 you see one day i was sparring with this boy much older than me we both started to slap each other around except he hit me real hard on my ear
4919792 no not right away i had start bleeding from my ears and then some one called ustad reema he knew how to treat many injuries he cleaned the blood off my face put some oil in my ears and stuff them with small pieces of cotton my wounds recovered after some time except i could not hear no more
4919793 lets rush him to the doctor his head is bleeding
4919794 could doctor sahab come out we have someone badly hurt out here
4919795 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
4919796 if we dont get good rains in the next couple of months this will put pressure on crops we could see crop failure and of course this could only lead to further price hikes in the food area
4919797 just as fuel is subject to global pressures so to is food
4919798 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number today for somebody to win the tournament
4919799 in no way limit or put in danger the freedom of movement and travel along the road and rail axes of georgia
4919800 reiterated united states support for the government and people of georgia
4919801 the russian military has effective control of the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
4919802 i feel pressure but i was really nervous today i didnt feel like on the first two holes i was able to make a shot it was just a good day for me
4919803 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4919804 well sigh yo i i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is above my pay grade
4919805 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4919806 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4919807 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4919808 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4919809 in illegal informal settlements there are a lot of social factors that come into being high on the list is drunkenness where a person drinks and forgets to put out the candle or they might leave a pot cooking on a stove and go and buy beer again
4919810 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4919811 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4919812 alison tyler is an author to rely on for steamy sexy page turners try her
4919813 ojal podamos jugar otro partido contra estados unidos seguro que no ser de sta manera
4919814 ha sido un triunfo espectacular y tiene un m rito enorme
4919815 s lo tengo un sue o ser campe n ol mpico
4919816 yeah i go poo poo katie has her doodle board
4919817 at 20 years of age the will reigns at 30 the wit at 40 the judgment
4919818 i used to work in a fire hydrant factory you couldnt park anywhere near the place
4919819 the fire is estimated to be 80 percent contained and isolated to the abandoned housing area
4919820 productivity has been down across the board in this region
4919821 its a very dynamic and complicated environment with a lot of different pressures on it
4919822 once the birds are there we dont allow any traffic through that site there is no bathing or walking on the sand
4919823 when we remove human activity we are removing a factor that directly affects the birds
4919824 there is just too much development in rockaway that poses a problem for the nesting birds
4919825 with people come stray cats dogs trash and everything that will negatively impact the piping plovers
4919826 the beach ball or umbrella that blows away you cant go into the nesting area to get if you do youll get punished for it
4919827 come to elvis dee and the presentation of awards to distinguished members of new yorks caribbean community
4919828 theres going to be programming on the scoreboard throughout the night with information pertaining to the caribbean community thats going to be the theme for the whole night
4919829 these individuals are typically home all day either with a home health aide or watching television
4919830 being able to interact with people like themselves is very important
4919831 the stimulation she gets here has made a remarkable difference in terms of mental clarity
4919832 theyre fully aware and they make sure im aware and that gives me peace of mind
4919833 this program is as much for us as it is for them
4919834 save the taxpayers of this country a great deal of money and kill them the undocumented immigrants on the spot along with those who think they deserve anything better
4919835 who think these pieces of ill spare the reader the disgusting epithet deserve anything better
4919836 i understand that your agency has important homeland security duties but as ive said before i think that there needs to be a clear understanding about the difference between people who come here in search of a better life and those who come here to do us harm
4919837 however it must also be understood that there is a certain standard we should live up to for everyone we have detained and it is outrageous that anyone would be treated in such a fashion while in your custody
4919838 his spine was fractured and his body riddled with cancer that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for months
4919839 its almost like you have a kitchen full of little children that are hungry and want to eat
4919840 the pantry has a lock on the door but the pantry is filled with food
4919841 nothing so becomes a church as silence and good order noise belongs to theaters and baths and public processions and marketplaces but where doctrines and such doctrines are the subject of teaching there should be stillness and quiet and calm reflection and a haven of much repose
4919842 it is not fitting that the servant should be applauded in his masters house
4919843 whenever applause breaks out in the liturgy because of some human achievement it is a sure sign that the essence of the liturgy has totally disappeared and been replaced by a kind of religious entertainment
4919844 hey brett ill let you play as long as you want
4919845 hey what are you doing why didnt you keep that ball
4919846 can you get that ball favre is probably going to want it
4919847 i was going to let you have the ball but i think im going to keep that one
4919848 when pharaoh says to you perform a miracle then say to aaron take your staff and throw it down before pharaoh and it will become a snake
4919849 o yahweh god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known today that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and have done all these things at your command answer me o yahweh answer me so these people will know that you o yahweh are god and that you are turning their hearts back again
4919850 tell me is this the price you and ananias got for the land
4919851 how could you agree to test the spirit of the lord look the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out also
4919852 we fly it in from norway with the gjettost cheese
4919853 just take a look at the blueprints and tell me what you think of the placement of the equipment as well
4919854 its simple really if enough people go to total fitness centers they become slimmer or at least engaged in the system the key would be for me to get to fatland people with mandated exercise programs since they cant diet but that may be far in the future theyre pretty hardline there now
4919855 why do you care what they do or dont do
4919856 ill have a look at those plants when youre ready
4919857 brenton isnt this a little premature after all she hasnt been voted in yet
4919858 the first item on our agenda tonight is to elect a new member of the board according to our rules margaret clancy has been proposed by two members and we find her qualifications in order a three quarters majority is needed to elect with overwhelming consent a two thirds majority is needed to elect with strong consent while a simply majority will elect a member with consent i therefore move to start the proceedings to elect margaret clancy to this board do i hear a second
4919859 since there is a second we may proceed ms clancy you are entitled to have one member of the board speak for you and then to speak for yourself would you like to avail yourself of this opportunity
4919860 be it noted then that margaret will speak on her own behalf followed by angela who will speak on margarets behalf margaret
4919861 shows me as a man of the people not afraid to buy my own cabbage and greens you know
4919862 just show them that youll love your job you preside so well as it is its a natural talent
4919863 thanks of course want to come with me on a few stops
4919864 she thought of all the schedules she would have to juggle to set aside even an hour but to come with brenton it was what she had longed for then given up on only to have the 0pportunity tossed so casually into her lap
4919865 see how im received and i would welcome your opinion on strategy
4919866 a couple of them then ill have to get back to planning
4919867 ill meet you at larry fats in a couple of hours then well have a bite first
4919868 shortfall in quadreant four that i dont quite understand want to meet with you tomorrow before we call a board meeting
4919869 that facility has some of the best medical personnel in the world if its the one im thinking of
4919870 so youre saying bill would be able to walk again
4919871 he would be able to walk again as long as he stayed there
4919872 motion to replace charla with another member of the board
4919873 but its been six months we need twelve people now not six and margaret deserves it
4919874 and im sure most people will see it that way everyone actually
4919875 on its face the moa is patently illegal under our present laws
4919876 i hope that the interim administration will follow the fundamentals that have been put in place so there is financial and economical recovery
4919877 so having done what needed to be done tourism has made a very strong comeback and local government reforms are on the way employment relations promulgation is there
4919878 to this end the flp will begin its charter consultation process immediately
4919879 a timetable has been set which will see the flp leadership as well as its senor party officials in the coming weeks traverse the nation and engage in active consultation with the people
4919880 a concerted media campaign will also be conducted in tandem with the interactive consultation process to enhance public awareness and education
4919881 as far as im concerned there is no directive or anything at all in that regard and if they have any evidence of it then they better produce it
4919882 i had hinted earlier to the pm that once its work on the charter is completed we will have to exit in order to strengthen the partys machinery for next general elections
4919883 that is exactly what we are doing and that is the reason for our exit
4919884 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4919885 well sigh yo i i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is above my pay grade
4919886 daniel reneau who coldly murdered kriss keeran in the early morning hours of january 2 1996 has already been executed by the state of texas for this senseless act
4919887 nevertheless on august 21 2008 the state seeks to execute jeffery wood for the same crime even though the state does not contend that mr wood shot keeran in fact mr wood was not even in the building when reneau shot and killed keeran
4919888 bunker despite being a co conspirator without whose agreement and encouragement the crime never would have occurred was never charged with any crime
4919889 bowing to mr woods emotional and irrational insistence mr woods appointed lawyers declined to cross examine any witnesses or present any evidence on mr woods behalf
4919890 mr woods trial attorneys called mr woods actions a gesture of suicide and objected on moral grounds to participating in the arrangement ordered by the trial court effectively as legal vessels assisting mr woods suicidal ends
4919891 despite having a valid license grigson was a medical fraud although mr woods jury did not know it
4919892 in 1995 three years before he testified in mr woods trial grigson was expelled from the american psychiatric association and the texas society of psychiatric physicians for flagrant ethical violations related to his testimony purporting to predict future dangerousness because he was not cross examined mr woods jury was not aware of this information nor did the state elicit it despite its duty to see that justice is done and to disclose impeachment evidence
4919893 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
4919894 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4919895 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4919896 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4919897 my wife wants to buy a microwave oven i have my doubts about their safety nutrition wise should i follow my heart here and tell her no
4919898 i hold that when a person dies his soul returns again to earth arrayed in some new flesh disguise another mother gives him birth with sturdier limbs and brighter brain the old soul takes the road again
4919899 im happy with the way this first game this first chance to play went
4919900 i felt good out there i felt like i played average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere i will take a few good four yard carries like i had saturday i ran with some toughness and i put my foot down a couple of times in there
4919901 its just like one big party for adults rated adults only
4919902 they the parties may draw a lot of interesting folks but they may not draw me i am not the chick i was eight years ago
4919903 he is a remarkable person and ive always thought that
4919904 i simply identified more with a strong woman it seems that sen obama does not have an aversion to having strong women around him
4919905 the sheer number of primary votes that she received indicated her ability to be a presidential candidate and ultimately lead this country
4919906 more casual fans that theyre already very close to understanding the ultimate goal in sabermetrics but just dont realize it yet
4919907 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
4919908 how can i make a simple yeast free bread my wife is intolerant to yeast
4919909 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
4919910 why are you so distant from the ones who love you the most
4919911 i am a constantly changing person i am someone one moment and than the exact opposite the next
4919912 they are just i just do not think they are cute at all maybe if they had a great personality then yeah but they dont at all
4919913 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4919914 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4919915 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4919916 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4919917 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4919918 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4919919 everyone helpin each other whenever they can we makin it happen from nothin to somethin
4919920 he kind of rolled his eyes and goes i am not waiting for the sheriff to get here
4919921 thats when i jumped in the back of the truck
4919922 we just recently had cameras put in because we had so many drive offs
4919923 the other beautiful part is we got the man and hopefully hell never do it again
4919924 cynthia heimel essayist extraordinaire wrote that difficult men are considered cool romantic interesting while difficult women are considered deranged sicko neurotic nymphos so we see a fellow who is like you and we identitfy all those secret subterranean urges that we deny ourselves are manifested in this man and we fall madly in love with the idea of him often not even vaguely understanding that were falling in love with an aspect of ourselves that weve denied hidden blocked ignored that sounds about right you are like the fiddler stealing everyones soul
4919925 yo no creo que hayamos tenido un buen funcionamiento nos encontramos con dos goles que nos dan la victoria que es buena porque veracruz tiene que acostumbrarse a ganar tambi n pero no significa que porque ganes hiciste un partido ideal o un buen partido
4919926 debemos estar concientes que veracruz es el rival a vencer somos un equipo que va a ser protagonista y se nos van a venir a parar atr s se nos van a venir a parar de mil formas y nosotros tenemos que saber de que cualquier forma en que se nos paren tenemos que ganar los partidos
4919927 fue un partido dif cil jugamos ante un rival muy din mico con una propuesta muy clara y la fortaleza del equipo fue haber buscado el triunfo hasta el final no dejar de pelear no dejar de tener en mente sacar el triunfo adelante que eso fue la fortaleza el car cter el esp ritu del equipo que ahora fue superior
4919928 fue un buen resultado pero un mal funcionamiento tenemos que mejorar mucho porque este equipo es para aplastar y m s en casa no podemos ganar as hay que ganar mucho m s holgadamente
4919929 creo que se complic solo yo pienso que jugamos muy atr s muy defensivo y el equipo gan porque tiene individualidades no porque jug bien
4919930 no individualmente el rendimiento fue muy bueno luchan pelean meten gol meten la pierna el problema es el funcionamiento no me est convenciendo que no estemos funcionando como debemos de funcionar
4919931 siempre platicamos todas las jornadas y exponemos todos nuestros puntos de vista yo no me quiero callar absolutamente nada
4919932 porque con el resultado que tuvimos en chetumal no estoy molesto estoy molest simo y si no ganamos en m rida se va a poner dif cil la cosa
4919933 son un orgullo para el atlas esto nos hace pensar con seriedad que hay talento para el futuro
4919934 cero inconvenientes algunos integrantes de la barra de san luis estaban muy alcoholizados hicieron peque os desmanes pero todo sin novedad muchos aficionados potosinos se quedaron concentrados en avenida normalistas por exceso de ebriedad
4919935 en este momento estamos realizando dos campa as por mes y ya hemos recogido a cerca 350 ni os ello nos ha obligado a mejorar los albergues para acoger a los menores
4919936 pol tica sociales de lucha contra la pobreza en el per
4919937 parte de ello fue el concierto por los ni os del per que les permite reforzar su autoestima subir a un escenario saber cantar y expresarse que tambi n es muy importante
4919938 hace un mes hemos hecho una feria donde se han vendido productos hechos por ellos mismos el adulto mayor es una persona til que tiene todos sus conocimientos pero lamentablemente nuestra sociedad no los est valorando como debiera
4919939 to the place where the actual bones of the apostle st james are enshrined in that silver reliquary
4919940 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
4919941 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window
4919942 i still maintain it doesn t make a shred of difference to the pilgrim experience anyway not for the vast majority of us
4919943 i do hope youll join us to find some very simple answers on seven very simple questions
4919944 the codex is the work of one man he may have been called aimery picaud
4919945 santiago was a pilgrimage centre of more than national importance
4919946 blindness can never hold its own in argument against those who see whatever may be said by excuse for those who fail to see
4919947 el gobierno venezolano no cree en la democracia cree en un tipo de democracia autoritaria donde se restringen las libertades donde se discrimina
4919948 creo que en am rica latina en general la democracia est resistiendo
4919949 los pueblos a veces se equivocan y la pagan muy caro
4919950 autoritarismo el populismo es una ceguera que hay que combatir
4919951 sufrimientos en recortes de las libertades en frustraci n en corrupci n en violencia
4919952 el desmoronamiento lleg con las umap que eran campos de concentraci n donde llevaban desde los anticastristas hasta los homosexuales con criminales comunes hubo hasta suicidios fue para m el primer trauma muy serio
4919953 fue una poca en al que me empec a preguntarme si realmente no me estaba equivocando
4919954 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4919955 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4919956 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4919957 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4919958 these networks are well embedded in some of these countries
4919959 sin duda fue una mala noche donde terminamos perdiendo creo que logramos levantarnos empatar el partido ponernos al frente en el marcador pero el futbol es as cambia en un rato y eso fue lo que pas y son de las cosas que obviamente uno tiene que aprender
4919960 sabemos que puede pasar y jugadores como en este caso baloy jugadores internacionales de selecci n no puede volver a cometer un error de stos porque hoy en el futbol porque jugar sin uno es dar ventaja y ning n rival es chico y lo supieron aprovechar
4919961 s fue determinante porque en ese momento nos empatan el partido y el equipo no alcanza a reponerse
4919962 despu s de la expulsi n viene el gol r pido en la misma jugada y eso animicamente te baja no nos pudimos levantar cuando quisimos jugar nos hacen otro gol y despu s del 4 2
4919963 qu bueno por l que anot para bien de tecos es un jugador importante para ellos hizo dos goles dio un pase para gol hizo expulsar a dos jugadores qu le podemos decir excelente yo nunca he negado su capacidad y es un jugador que tiene gol hoy supo hacerlos
4919964 es una buena victoria creo que el equipo ha jugado bien ellos ten an un jugador menos primero sali baloy pero nosotros fuimos superiores
4919965 fue un partido especial para m desde hace mucho tiempo quer a marcar mi gol y gracias a dios fue hoy y no porque sea monterrey sino por la forma que mucha gente criticaba
4919966 lo importante es que demostr mi valor con un entrenador jos luis trejo que me dio la confianza yo creo que se pudo hacer mejor para m y para el equipo
4919967 ya jugu cuatro partidos en los tres primeros no marqu gol pero poco a poco estoy mejorando la confianza a partir de hoy va a ser cien por ciento y yo voy en busca de m s goles debo pelear por el t tulo de goleo
4919968 s importante no por ser monterrey es un equipo que yo quiero much simo un equipo que tiene una afici n de las mejores y tengo que agradecer a todos los momentos que pas aqu y no me fue muy bien pero gracias a dios yo pude demostrar mi valor
4919969 bamos perdiendo 2 1 tuvimos una reacci n y demostramos que tenemos un equipo fuerte para llegar a la liguilla
4919970 yo creo que s apenas en guadalajara yo dije que me gustar a anotar gol no porque es monterrey yo quer a marcar despu s de seis meses de no marcar gol pero hay gente que habla mucho hablan de m aqu y la verdad hoy demostr que estoy vivo y que puedo ser de los mejores
4919971 primero yo respet a monterrey no quise festejar pero yo vi que la afici n no se qued contenta me pit todo el tiempo y despu s del segundo gol yo tuve que festejar fue m rito m o
4919972 yo s que todos salieron enojados conmigo pero el futbol es as yo tengo que hacer lo mejor para mi equipo
4919973 they can become obsessed with protecting the revenue and miss the bigger picture of creating a more productive and globally competitive tax system
4919974 some in the ato see the international tax reforms of the past six years as the devils spawn and talk about rescuing the system and saving the governments revenue flows
4919975 the lot is cast in the lap but its every decision is from the lord
4919976 wealth acquired by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathers by labor shall increase
4919977 the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs
4919978 let your manner of life be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may confidently say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
4919979 i disagree with what you have to say but will fight to the death to protect your right to say it
4919980 however even if i agree with you if it might annoy an illiterate muslim ten thousand miles away im out of here
4919981 les fleurs fragrances were created with passionate modern women in mind the scents change to match the daily schedules and different moods that women experience in all phases of their lives
4919982 les fleurs fragrances are for the woman who wants everything and demands perfection they are ahead of the trends and have exquisite taste
4919983 obviously the message from the obama campaign is change and a new kind of politics
4919984 i wanted to send a message that change is not just words if you are going to say something you need to back it up
4919985 as much fun as you can have in a combat zone
4919986 pockets of iraq are humming along other sections not so much i think the government of iraq has to do things on its own you can only help them so much
4919987 we have to leave in a responsible manner that means playing hardball with the iraq government
4919988 the gospel does teach us about caring for our fellow man
4919989 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4919990 everything happened so fast that i really havent had an opportunity to reflect on what ive done or what ive accomplished
4919991 i just knew what i wanted to get i knew how to get there and i never questioned my ability to do it
4919992 hes never really failed so theres no reason for him to be anything other than what he is right now
4919993 ive had people ask me is his swing long and i laugh
4919994 because what youre seeing is the finish he fires so quickly to the ball its as good as anyones ive seen
4919995 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4919996 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4919997 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4919998 i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont
4919999 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
