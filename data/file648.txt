6480223 the 21st century has an extreme reminiscence to the 21st year of a persons life it is a year of coming of age when a person becomes an adult mankind has not the right to take a beautiful world with all its privileges and opportunities and turn it into a purgatory this situation should remind freemasons that they have something to live for we have the power to build worlds the wisdom to govern them and the divine right to inherit the earth and preserve it in good condition in order to pass it on to our descendents as a place of happiness usefulness and security for thousands of years to come were not asking for treason were not asking for disobedience were only asking that in every way possible when they have the choice stand for truth and if necessary take a little punishment for it

6480230 broader market conditions have tightened across australia and indeed in new zealand we are seeing tightening across the network of where our newspapers are
6480231 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6480232 on the downside weve made no bones about the fact that we continue to see leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising and that will no doubt continue
6480233 on the upside of course we are building new businesses on the internet
6480234 as far as expansion theres nothing on the plate at the moment whatsoever

6480237 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6480238 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6480239 were always monitoring all the general insurance companies in australia
6480240 that includes businesses like allianz australia and wesfarmers lumleys arm but when you look at the prices weve just got more opportunities offshore that make more sense for our shareholders
6480241 we put a proposal on the table and they rejected it and were now just getting on with life
6480242 there is evidence of market hardening in some sectors with premium rate increases particularly in personal lines and small to medium enterprises these representing the majority of our australian portfolio
6480243 however large corporate risks are still experiencing premium rate reductions due to strong competition by some insurers in australia and the london market
6480244 with this in mind we will focus the business on controlling costs making our operations more efficient and ensuring high quality well managed inventories
6480245 we will however continue to invest in new stores and the expansion of our existing stores with a view to delivering further growth in returns to our shareholders
6480246 california fresh tomato growers are not nearly as devastated as our counterparts were in florida or mexico from this outbreak
6480247 the end result is that fda warnings went out and the response by a number of tomato customers was the panic mode and tomatoes were pulled off store shelves and menus
6480248 the industry is recovering in food service but i think well have a tougher time at retail
6480249 with food service a person orders a burger or sandwich and doesnt think twice about tomatoes on it when consumers walked up to a tomato display at the grocery store there were weeks after the fda announcement when there was more signage than tomatoes in the display a lot of consumers stopped buying tomatoes
6480250 we have to get to the bottom of this and not allow the tomato issue to linger
6480251 if it lingers this will haunt us in the future that is the number one issue now focusing on the investigation into what went right and wrong a mechanism is needed so we never go through this again
6480252 the fdas warnings about tomatoes devastated the 1 3 billion u s tomato industry
6480253 due to the timing of the salmonella outbreak florida was hit hard we need to ensure that all impacted u s tomato growers and packers are compensated for their losses to protect domestic food production
6480254 the salmonella tomato issue is no different than a natural disaster
6480255 growers had no say in this issue and there have been substantial losses across the country we appreciate the members of congress who are stepping forward to provide some measure of restitution
6480256 i think most consumers look at fresh market and processing tomatoes as separate items fresh market for salads and sandwiches and processing for soups and pasta sauces
6480257 we have said our processing tomato products are safe but were not trying to denigrate the fresh market tomato industry
6480258 in the short term weve seen little to no effect probably because all of our products are marketed in clusters or on the vine

6480262 how might we explain all of this well in my view these folks are essentially marxist and at base we might consider marxist thought a doctrine of hatred a secular demonology
6480263 we hate those whose existence urges us to reconsider our theories and our vocabularies we hate what places a safe and irresponsible categorization of the world in jeopardy we hate what threatens the purity and predictability of our perception of the world our mode of discourse and in effect our mental security
6480264 thus for the left rather than consider that vulgarity has no proper place in the respectable exchange of ideas crude language is a tool to beat down those who would challenge their way of seeing the world especially those allegedly in the right wing superstructure of greedy imperialistic designs
6480265 the angry right just yelled louder and was able to sway the debate despite their vacuous and wrong headed arguments
6480266 weve got to get angry to get more of us mobilized

6480269 we have spent thousands of dollars in production costs and pesticide applications trying to eradicate plant pests on our crops

6480271 it has now been found in lakes havasu mohave and pleasant
6480272 this species was known to be a nuisance at the great lakes in michigan but has now been introduced to the western states by people who really didnt know better and likely purely by accident
6480273 arizona will take the steps outlined in the management plan developed by the council to address invasive species education control and restoration needs

6480289 por qu toman decisi n tan apresurada si el gobierno est tan apurado deber a permitir una discusi n seria y profunda de c mo manejar el espectro radiof nico en el mbito del congreso estamos ante otra prueba del doble discurso del gobierno que por un lado cancela un espacio en fm porque duplica contenidos pero por el otro no explica c mo va a distribuir las licencias me pregunto qu van a hacer con el resto de las cadenas que hay en el pa s porque si revocan la licencia de continental tendr an que hacer lo mismo con todo el resto

6480338 we work very hard as a team and you know we will progress every game and be better
6480339 we have a lot of quality in the team like robbie keane steven gerrard and of course torres so we know if we work hard well get our chances and we have the ability to score in every game
6480340 the team is getting better and better and the most important thing is to look at ourselves
6480341 i think we dont have to look too much to be teams like manchester united or chelsea or arsenal we just have to look at ourselves

6480353 the christian community is not happy about this mayhem intimidation antagonism and political animosity among the political parties we are advising our members to shun politicians who engage in personality attacks and other undemocratic tendencies ghanaians need peace and stability to develop
6480354 we detest politicians who attack personalities but appreciate those who propagate on issues personality attacks distract voters but issue based politicking attracts floating voters
6480355 as it will create problems for acceptability of the election results

6480465 i know other clubs have the same problem but to take players away when they have only just completed pre season and played one game is difficult to understand
6480466 if they were world cup or european championship qualifiers it would be different but to arrange friendlies at this time of year is tough to comprehend
6480467 players will be flying all over the world and playing in games which dont mean a lot it hinders our preparations because we dont know how those players are going to be until they report back
6480468 i honestly believe the countries should pay the players wages while they are away i cant see any reason why they shouldnt

6480495 any tool must fit within my existing workflows once adopted i may be persuaded to modify or improve my workflow but to be adopted it has to fit to start with any new tool must clearly outperform all the existing tools that it will replace in the relevant workflows without the requirement for network or social effects its got to be absolutely clear on first use that i am going to want to use this instead of some other tool like a lab web site and this has to be absolutely clear the first time i use the system before i have created any local social network and before you have a large enough user base for these to be effective it must be near 100 reliable with near 100 uptime addendum make sure people can easily download their stuff in a form that will be useful even if your service disappears obviously theyll never need to but it will make them feel better and dont scrimp on this because they will check if it works provide at least one but not too many really exciting new feature that makes peoples life better this is related to 2 but is taking it a step further beyond just doing what i already do better i need a quick fix of something new and exciting prepopulate build in publically available information before the users arrive

6480499 the idea used to be that you had to bring indian kids off reserves to save them
6480500 now were trying to work with the communities to ensure that the answer is from home because thats the best place to find answers no system can replace the family
6480501 although kids may still be taken away from parents for alcoholism or whatever they generally now have the opportunity to stay in the same community
6480502 tikinagan has helped to dramatically improve services in the north new partnerships with first nations help keep children safe and connected to their family and cultural identity
6480503 the active recruitment and training of community members helps establish a strong local presence and quicker response times the result is strengthened families healthier children and youth and a stronger sense of community pride
6480504 the answers lie within the communities is a very challenging statement when you try to live by it
6480505 this award will expand our ability to respond and test innovative ways that can help our children discover their past seize the present and anticipate their future
6480506 the excellence of tikinagan can be measured by the thousand daily acts to counter hopelessness deep poverty and alarming rates of teen suicide among young people in our north

6480509 the problems of being up against people whose thinking had completely petrified
6480510 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6480511 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6480512 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6480513 hundreds of degrees below those typically considered in current practice for fire resistance ratings
6480514 while the partial or total collapse of a tall building due to fires is a rare event we strongly urge building owners operators and designers to evaluate buildings to ensure the adequate fire performance of the structural system of particular concern are the effects of thermal expansion in buildings with one or more of the following features long span floor systems connections not designed for thermal effects asymmetric floor framing and or composite floor systems
6480515 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire
6480516 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6480517 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6480518 sound level of 130 to 140 decibels at a distance of half a mile
6480519 while debris impact from the collapse of wtc 1 initiated fires in wtc 7 the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of wtc 7

6480526 i enjoyed my time at the dragons so i am looking forward to the chance of playing at rodney parade
6480527 hopefully ill be selected for that game because it should be a good match and im keen to get as much game time under my belt as possible before the start of the season
6480528 the match against bedford looked like our first match of the season and we got caught cold
6480529 we need a better performance against saracens for ourselves and our fans
6480530 so it was a pretty amazing beautiful day today huh kj
6480531 i dont know pretty hot and windy i dealt with a lot of windstorms
6480532 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
6480533 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
6480534 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
6480535 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
6480536 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
6480537 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology
6480538 these are isolated incidents but they do reflect a major sickness in our jerusalem arab society
6480539 what is the driving force behind a two state solution the fact that it seems more acceptable to a majority of people on both sides and therefore more applicable the primary motivation is to minimize human suffering this is what we should all be looking at if there will be a one state solution it will not come today or tomorrow its a long protracted thing not the ideal solution unless in an ideal world people really want to be together then it is the ideal solution the best solution the one that causes the least pain and that can actually be instrumental to a one state solution is to have peace now and acceptance of one another on the basis of two states
6480540 fifty 100 200 years down the road there will be some kind of conclusion sometime in the future however far away this future is i believe well be living at peace with one another in some way or another i am not sure how whether in one state or two states or in a confederation of states but people finally will come to live at peace in the meantime we will simply cause pain to one another its tragic it is very tragic because we know we can do it now that today it is possible with some guts leadership vision we can make it happen today we can reach a peaceful solution today the arab peace initiative proposed in 2002 is a fantastic chance the palestinians have adopted it theyll go with it all the way it is a perfect chance it doesnt even mention right of return it is even better than the ayalon nusseibeh plan but i am willing to accept it
6480541 because for israel however important jerusalem may be the primary factor is the jewish character of the state
6480542 the facts on the ground are making the situation irreversible
6480543 take the clinton parameters palestinian neighborhoods are palestinian sovereignty jewish neighborhoods are jewish sovereignty they are acceptable in principle but with realities on the ground like the expulsion of arab families from their homes in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood and the inhabitation of those areas by jewish settlers its going to be unacceptable on a practical level thats why we dont have time
6480544 ramallahs reaction was a bit worried they called me a few times a bit worried
6480545 we have a terrible situation our political bible our platform our moral values we need to be brought together again if not for creating a state then for our own sanity and for own values as a people apart from in ramallah everybody is living under very bad conditions the occupation is terrible the siege is everywhere pressure as it is the europeans are financing the occupation and the europeans are happy because they feel theyre doing something it cleans their conscience and the israelis are happy because theyre not paying for it and the palestinians are happy because they are getting their wages paid it keeps the economy going and people are getting complacent about it its dead money going after dead money
6480546 i said i want to tell you what you can do to transform yourself from a payer into a player make your money payments conditional on tangible progress in the peace process
6480547 i was in brussels i gave a talk and i said to the europeans if you want to pass on money do it only on the condition we build a state in which case it makes sense for you to spend money to build us an international airport but if in the end there isnt going to be an independent palestinian state why waste your money waste your money if you need to on integrating us into israeli society makes more sense pay the money for us to become part of israel to have equal rights raise our level of education bring our standards of living up but to have the pa taking all this money creating all this debt makes no sense maybe the europeans should link the aid they are giving us to real progress in peace talks so that both the israelis and the palestinians will be shocked out of their complacency or lack of commitment
6480548 the pa has no use if we fail to reach a peace agreement by the end of this year i believe it would be best to go back to the period when we were living happily under occupation we had a small civil administration they were paying back some 20 million a year to the israeli treasury so they were making money off us today we are creating year after year bigger deficits we are spending billions we have 160 000 employees half of them are security personnel who give us no security whatsoever we are spending masses of money on guns which we only use against each other and which provide us no security the whole thing is a mess
6480549 people in jerusalem why should they attach themselves to the muqata to ramallah
6480550 i was still hoping because before he went to the labor party he came and spoke to me i like this about him i knew what he was doing people were pushing him for a long time trying to get him into the system and he resisted but then at one stage i think he made up his mind maybe i can lead the labor party and then this is the best place for me to be i said fine do it i was unhappy that he became marginalized as minister without portfolio
6480551 would come to the palestinian people and say i initialed such a document
6480552 i believe that on israeli side olmert could do the same we dont know whether both leaders will be reelected but its worth doing even if theyre not because at least we know weve given this peace agreement a chance
6480553 i agree with sari nusseibeh that time is running out for the two state solution
6480554 i share his view that olmert missed a chance to get an agreement due to efforts to insure his own political survival the labor party will not succeed in getting back in power by attacking the other parties but only by raising the common banner of security and political agreements

6480571 the so called offences were supposed to have been committed some two years ago its strange that in our uniquely singapore it has taken the authorities such a long time to bring us before you this is absurd if we are considered to have committed the offences then the very existence of our countrys constitution and the national pledge make no sense
6480572 how can i plead guilty to something that our constitution tells me is my right

6480582 the economy should improve next year though the housing market will start heading up in the second half of the year and the consumer will come back especially if we continue to get a break on inflation with oil prices coming down

6480613 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6480614 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6480615 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6480616 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6480617 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent

6480623 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

6480633 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6480634 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6480655 the top tier firms will have an even tougher year with profits down by 5 15 our reason for providing a range is that there is an elephant in the room how will firms particularly the top tier firms handle associate bonuses this year the rational approach would be to pare them back but while lawyers display rationality and dispassion in the practice of law they have exhibited irrational exuberance on this issue in the past
6480656 a bad year and the numbers suggest 2008 will be even more trying than 2001 when partner profits were down slightly
6480657 will enable firms to take steps that partners would resist in a good year winnowing out unproductive lawyers and applying greater discipline to expense control

6480761 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6480762 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6480763 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6480764 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6480765 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6480766 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6480767 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6480768 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6480769 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6480770 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6480771 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6480772 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6480773 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6480774 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6480775 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6480776 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6480777 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6480778 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6480779 heres a bunch of scripture set to music and youre going to hell if you dont get it

6480782 eight hundred fifty jobs of any kind is great news when those jobs are in a technology of tomorrow like electric cars it offers the prospect of even bigger news to follow indiana has what it takes to lead this automotive revolution and today is step one
6480783 indiana is the heart of americas manufacturing might and a linchpin in the automotive industry there is no better place to invest in the clean green energy efficient technology we need to power todays global economy
6480784 indianas educated experienced workforce is second to none and the enthusiastic commitment we have received from governor daniels and other leaders is absolutely unparalleled we couldnt be happier to call this our home
6480785 there is no doubt that enerdel is a leader in advanced manufacturing and we are fortunate that their new global manufacturing and development operations will be located here in marion county
6480786 they are not only bringing great jobs and investment to our county but they are serving as a sign that marion county is a great home for the future of manufacturing
6480787 we are honored and excited that a growing and innovative company like enerdel has chosen to expand its operations to the city of noblesville
6480788 what a fine testament to the talented hard working people of this city and the business friendly environment our economic development team has worked so hard to create we look forward to working with enerdel and to potential future development with them

6480791 its great to play like this in your last game
6480792 in the end the team was playing for me and thats why i could make the shots
6480793 i thought we did ok but they just outplayed us
6480794 we could never quite get over the hump we were tied but we couldnt get the lead
6480795 i pretty much just ran with my eyes closed until about 150 it was my best 200 in a long time and i ran all the way through thats what i was working for
6480796 we came out here to run our hearts out and get some revenge towards jamaica
6480797 but you gotta do the first round before you do the final no excuses we trained hard we had great chemistry
6480798 we saw a few of the replays it looked like it was a good handoff im telling people the stick had a mind of its own it wasnt me it wasnt torri maybe it was electronic it had a bug in it it jumped out

6480800 one of my male friends told me that he had a crush on me the other night weve hung out and i like him hes nice and not to mention cute the problem is that i just recently got out of a long term relationship and im not ready to commit to another relationship but i dont want to miss out on somebody that could be really good for me also should i take a chance and give this guy a shot even though im not completely over my ex
6480801 oh come on if you want to people to be upset about waterboarding dont demonstrate it on

6480804 prices have climbed on renewed geopolitical tensions between the us and russia with the latter voicing its displeasure over a us poland defence pact whereby the us can station defence shield missiles in poland much to russias dislike
6480805 crude futures were higher on thursday extending gains from yesterday on weakness in the dollar and persistent geopolitical fears
6480806 the latest diplomatic stand off with russia over georgia has once again reminded investors of the markets sensitivity to all kinds of geopolitical risks
6480807 these also include persistent tensions in the middle east and violence in
6480808 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6480809 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class

6480824 years ago farmers were uneducated and eccentric and said funny things and we ourselves were comparatively uneducated we had no antibiotics few drugs a lot of time was spent pouring things down cows throats the whole thing added up to a lot of laughs theres more science now but not so many laughs

6480834 at practice the past week since the 100 weve had great sticks but thats the way its been happening to me at the olympics
6480835 it was my fault i feel like i let them down
6480836 the frustrating thing is we felt so good coming out
6480837 we had the lead after the first three legs and i was about ready to put my hands up
6480838 we trained hard we were going for the world record and the gold
6480839 candidates who went on the show raised about 44 percent more money than like candidates who didnt in the 30 days after the show
6480840 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6480841 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6480842 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6480843 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6480844 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6480845 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6480846 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6480847 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6480848 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6480849 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6480850 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6480851 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6480852 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6480879 the majority of the uk population are white 92 the remaining 8 4 6 million people belong to other ethnic groups
6480880 people from minority ethnic groups made up only 5 of the film production workforce below the uk all sectors average of 7 and well below the london workforce average of 24
6480881 production and distribution were concentrated in london and the south east with 76 and 68 3 of the workforce respectively
6480882 skillsets film skills fund is the largest fund in the uk dedicated to support film specific training
6480883 the graduate fellowship program was delivered under clause 37 of the race relations act which allows training organisations to run programmes for people from black and ethnic origin groups which have been demonstrated to be under represented in a particular industry research conducted by skillset has found that 7 of the workforce of londons audio visual industries is from black and ethnic minorities compared to 35 of the overall population of inner london

6480889 i faced them a couple weeks ago and it was probably more emotional then
6480890 but here this was just a big game it wouldnt have mattered if we were playing uzbekastan or someplace that nobodyd heard of i dont know ive got to soak it all in yet
6480891 i thought we played well for about three quarters eventually their depth and their size just overpowers you they have a very great team and we had to play perfectly and we didnt make some shots it makes life difficult when you dont hit shots
6480892 we had to have the ball bounce our way and we had to make some shots and things didnt go our way but you have to give credit to them
6480893 i thought it was a great game and it was good that we had to fight to get back into it
6480894 not that we were completely out of it but we were down i thought they forced us into a lot of early turnovers and we didnt settle in great in our offense
6480895 but our defense is how we were able to win it we had a lot of great defensive stops we stopped giving up transition baskets to them and that was pretty much the difference in the second half
6480896 i mean she did what she had to do and if shes comfortable with it then thats for her
6480897 at the end of the day we can only worry about the people in our locker room
6480898 growing up you think the olympics are about representing your country but being american is about opportunity too and exploring those opportunities whether people like them or not if you go to sleep happy and you go to sleep with a clean conscience youre an american and thats your right
6480899 for today becky was a russian to me and i didnt even recognize her it was just get out there and trap her when shes coming off those screens we did a nice job of shutting her down though as a team

6480933 if i may offer a silver lining there would have been a two year gap between

6480963 we are ready and dmitry medvedev has confirmed this to review a syrian request to purchase new types of weapons
6480964 we will supply syria primarily with weapons of a defensive nature that will not disturb the strategic balance in the region
6480965 our position is we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6480966 expose a direct url to the task on the client
6480967 si on veut que notre alli accepte nos failles il faut savoir accepter les siennes
6480968 our solutions have never been more compelling and our pipeline has never been stronger
6480969 nac is quickly becoming a fundamental component of security strategies in organizations around the world
6480970 parliament can hail this decision or criticize it but its statements have no legal force
6480971 it is now clear to everyone that the former soviet union cannot be rearranged solely to suit the west which is in no position to do this if the west tries to interfere it may face a confrontation with russia which it would rather avoid
6480972 it is important that russia think twice about who will support abkhazias independence and the de facto annexation of south ossetia rather than dream of a victory over georgia no western nation will recognize abkhazia which will end up having a similar status to northern cyprus it will also shatter the fragile balance established in the post cold war world
6480973 for the moment patrols are flown as part of exercises aircraft are not always in the air
6480974 perhaps if confrontation intensifies patrols will become regular as in soviet times and their scope will be expanded
6480975 it is quite conceivable that the u s congress will lift the moratorium on the jackson vanik amendment if bilateral relations deteriorate further
6480976 at least they are discussing sanctions against russia hypothetically it may be fraught with an arrest of russias state assets in the u s
6480977 russia has powerful pressure tools to influence the u s
6480978 we have vast amounts of government funds invested in u s dollars supporting the u s economy if they go ahead with the sanctions we divest our dollars we could also divest government assets and other high liquidity assets from american securities the money can be moved to asia or europe such actions will damage the u s economy more than the jackson vanik amendment may ever harm russias
6480979 gazprom planned to supply large volumes of lng to the north american market which is why statements of this kind bode ill for the holding they can complicate the companys entry into the new market
6480980 if other states take similar steps this will have a negative impact on the development of gazprom as a global energy company
6480981 canada is the u s s major trade economic and political partner given washingtons recent criticism of moscows current policy ottawa simply couldnt keep silent but it doesnt necessarily mean that they will break off their energy relations
6480982 we will transfer even insignificant stakes in territorial generating companies tgks from gazenergoprominvest and other affiliated companies to one company
6480983 this will allow us to include the energy companies financial data in gazproms consolidated reports besides we will be able to avoid some minor errors occurring when technological decisions which are not coordinated with the monopolys central office are taken when such things happen we have to urgently clarify all issues
6480984 will not have to nominate representatives of all subsidiaries to tgk and ogk wholesale generating companies boards of directors every spring but compile a consolidated list for all instead
6480985 old guy get on the internet for the first time
6480986 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6480987 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6480988 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6480989 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6480990 have a defensive character and that do not in any way interfere with the strategic balance in the region
6480991 tomorrow eight checkpoints will be established in the security zone in which 500 peacekeepers will be deployed no more than that
6480992 other peacekeepers will be moved to south ossetia while other troops will be moved to russia
6480993 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6480994 russia in this case will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic moves
6480995 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries the ap said
6480996 it all depends on nato priorities if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia that will not be our fault
6480997 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia

6481007 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6481008 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6481009 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6481010 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6481011 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6481012 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6481013 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6481014 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6481015 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6481016 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6481017 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6481018 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6481019 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6481020 its a binary outcome it can go one way or another
6481021 they already have an aging product if these new devices are great the stock price will go up if they are late it will go lower
6481022 if it actually came to the floor 70 or 80 percent of that room is pro life
6481023 thats the base of the party theres no reason for mccain to tear the scabs off the wounds
6481024 s perfetto ma negli usa nessuno ha letto collodi mentre tutti hanno visto la versione cinematografica di walt disney dove pinocchio finisce in una balena
6481025 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione
6481026 come se la ragione di tanti sprechi inefficienze ingiustizie cancrene fosse lassistenzialismo in s lo stato del benessere in s legualitarismo in s e non gli abusi le illegalit luso spregiudicato e clientelare che si fatto in italia di questi strumenti per altro mai posti alla base delle nostre scelte di politica economica
6481027 abbiamo adunque con la chiesa e coi preti noi italiani questo primo obligo di essere diventati sanza religione e cattivi ma ne abbiamo ancora uno maggiore il quale la seconda cagione della rovina nostra questo che la chiesa ha tenuto e tiene questa provincia divisa
6481028 ma per tornare agli anni settanta se non si poteva stare con il terrorismo o con la miriade di insopportabili mininomenclature della sinistra
6481029 non si deve scartare lipotesi anzi si deve prendere seriamente in considerazione lipotesi che
6481030 if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6481031 from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6481032 senator lieberman can speak to whatever group he wants but its not going to change the fact that john mccain is a flawed candidate who is wrong on every issue facing the country
6481033 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6481034 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6481035 the fast and furious 4 will also get his hands on hannibal and his elephants at last well sort of
6481036 you know my love of animation you know my love of the ralph bakshi films and how i was always a fan of that medium
6481037 im directing an animated hannibal that will serve as the prequel to the live action film so its hannibal as a boy so its like the boy and an elephant its for bet actually which will be great fun great great voices including diesel as hannibal
6481038 jasper what do vampires do for bachelor parties youre not taking him to a strip club are you
6481039 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6481040 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6481041 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6481042 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6481043 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6481044 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6481045 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6481046 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6481047 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6481048 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6481049 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6481050 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6481051 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6481052 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6481053 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6481054 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6481055 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6481056 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6481057 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6481058 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6481059 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6481060 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6481061 would you like me to put this in a sack for you
6481062 oh youre bored why dont you come over im just watching some tv
6481063 no where i come from friends actually hang out with one another
6481064 i think they show tremendous disparities in cancer for many american indian populations throughout the country
6481065 it really points to the fact that we need to try to engage health systems to take on cancer disparities
6481066 american indians tend to have a higher burden of many risk factors for cancer
6481067 current funding levels per capita for indian health service are about half of what the government spends on medicare funding and about half what they spend per capita on incarcerated persons in the prison system
6481068 certainly there needs to be awareness on the community level
6481069 it is a wake up call that we can be doing better and that communities should galvanize around cancer control issues
6481070 when resources are limited you tend to start prioritizing what you provide
6481071 but as funding becomes scarcer you tend to prioritize to life or death situations
6481072 the new information has great profound impacts on individual people
6481073 its your mother your father yourself your children that are at risk and can indeed experience this its so important to learn as much as you can and take advantage of the screening opportunities that are there
6481074 someone once said wings sleep in the dreams of man
6481075 that we know were destined to fly everybody wants to fly
6481076 when i discovered this powered parachute which only flies at 28 miles or so per hour and you fly with your feet
6481077 but the bottoms of my feet start to tingle and i dont like it so i come down most of my photographs are taken between 100 and 500 feet
6481078 you do see things up there particularly at the ends of the day when the light is coming across the earth and leaving enormous shadows hundreds of yards long
6481079 the earth is revealed in a totally different way thats the revelation really is the light
6481080 the red lines are the steering lines theyre attached to the foot bars so i want to make sure that those are ready to go
6481081 and i always wondered what would my life have been like here because this is the only place that i feel at home
6481082 i think that you have to go away to come back to see it with new eyes
6481083 if id grown up here i dont think id be able to see any of this stuff the way i do
6481084 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6481085 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6481086 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6481087 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6481088 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6481089 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6481090 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6481091 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6481092 the olympics ratings have been going down steadily over the years and my guess is that obama could compete pretty effectively for coverage with just about everything but the opening and closing ceremonies
6481093 so if obama wants a longer window in which to try to roll out his choice i dont think the olympics will stand in the way
6481094 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6481095 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6481096 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6481097 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6481098 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6481099 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6481100 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6481101 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6481102 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6481103 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6481104 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6481105 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6481106 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6481107 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6481108 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6481109 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6481110 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6481111 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6481112 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6481113 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6481114 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6481115 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6481116 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6481117 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6481118 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6481119 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6481120 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6481121 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6481122 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6481123 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6481124 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6481125 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6481126 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6481127 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6481128 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6481129 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6481130 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6481131 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6481132 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6481133 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6481134 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6481135 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6481136 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6481137 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6481138 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6481139 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6481140 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6481141 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6481142 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6481143 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6481144 let me do this it is the closest hardware store we have dropped a ton of money in there
6481145 dude the problem is not the paint or the cost of the paint it is our time we painted for like 8 hours 2 people 8 hours
6481146 well i do not trust you to mix my paint would you
6481147 can we get a gift certificate to make up for our time
6481148 what i can do is give you my card if you need something let me know you will have a standing discount call me and i will take care of you
6481149 i do not think this will work for me i do not want to walk in here and explain this ever again and i frankly do not trust you to follow through
6481150 no we are good get what you need to replace your painting supplies
6481151 i knew you would do this i should know better
6481152 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6481153 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6481154 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6481155 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6481156 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6481157 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6481158 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6481159 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6481160 we will get 1 of the 4 6 billion enterprise 2 0
6481161 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6481162 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6481163 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6481164 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6481165 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6481166 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6481167 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6481168 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6481169 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6481170 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6481171 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6481172 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6481173 aquecimento excessivo em uma v lvula de entrada de ar
6481174 this administration came to town saying that amtrak was a goner
6481175 but look whats happened people are sitting on these trains using them begging for opportunities
6481176 thats when you have to go faster than you normally would and they are about ready to recover here so now im going to have them pull back
6481177 im sweaty my scarf is going to get all sweaty thats nasty i cant do this ive got to go to work oh man
6481178 just watching them over this eight week period watching their stamina improve has been pretty exciting and their attitude more so than anything
6481179 where it was hard for them to o 25 jumping jacks in the beginning now they are knocking out a few sets of them and some other calisthenics and they are looking forward to it
6481180 where it was hard for them to do 25 jumping jacks in the beginning now they are knocking out a few sets of them and some other calisthenics and they are looking forward to it
6481181 they tell us that they are up at two and three in the morning eating pizza its unfortunate but kids will be kids
6481182 i dont like eating breakfast but then they told me that that will help you maintain your weight and lose weight by eating breakfast so ive been working hard to do that
6481183 it feels better i feel more energetic i dont feel as hungry as i used to around 12 oclock so it really does help
6481184 is this program going to solve the problem i dont think any one program is going to solve the problem
6481185 i think we need coordinated efforts between programs for children environmental change policy change outreach to parents and all of those things together will hopefully reverse the trend
6481186 ayer estuve con el m dico y me dijo que no me preocupara que estaba todo bien ten a una venda que ya me la sacaron todav a tengo algunos dolores sobretodo en la espalda producto del golpe
6481187 fue un golpe fuerte por la desaceleraci n ven a a 140km h y por suerte pegu contra un terrapl n de tierra blanda en realidad qued impresionado por como qued encajado y que no pod a salir de hecho el auto estaba para reengancharse el domingo
6481188 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6481189 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6481190 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna lance cade posted this on wwes fans website well summerslam was sure interesting wasnt it i knew chris jericho had plans depending on what hbk had to say but i honestly wasnt expecting fake ric flair bookings
6481191 it has been confirmed that gail kim is indeed through with tna
6481192 experience what goes on behind the scenes at a major event
6481193 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6481194 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6481195 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6481196 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6481197 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6481198 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6481199 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6481200 the lord is near do not worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace the shalom of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
6481201 let the same mind be in you that was in christ jesus who though he was in the form of god did not regard equality with god as something to be exploited as perhaps a roman emperor might presume but he emptied himself listen to those words do they still hold meaning to you taking the form of a slave
6481202 therefore god also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bend in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
6481203 i will be a pro life president and my administration will have pro life policies
6481204 the one thing i cant do laura and ill talk about anything you want to but the process that were in
6481205 i cant talk about it because if i do i would get down a slippery slope
6481206 the media is making a mistake trying to narrow the issue of vp selection to pro choice or pro life
6481207 that is a vast over simplification typical of the punditry the public will fit the selection into a much broader context that is what the mccain campaign is correctly focused on how the running mate fits into the context of their campaign
6481208 one should not consider mccains potential decision to select a pro choice running mate as an effort to re brand the party the party is pro life and we generate a significant amount of enthusiasm among the rank and file based on that issue position rather mccain picking a pro choice running mate has only to do with his effort to win election not to re brand the party
6481209 while mccain has built his political reputation on his willingness to go against his own party
6481210 the world is waking up to the fact that every molecule of energy that passes into europe is now controlled by a belligerent russia
6481211 obamas got a lot of ground to make up following that performance last weekend at the saddleback presidential forum with pastor rick warren
6481212 im pro infanticide i love sunsets and i dont get the 13th amendment
6481213 well actually my experience in foreign policy is probably more diverse than most others in the field im somebody who has actually lived overseas somebody who has studied overseas i majored in international relations
6481214 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6481215 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6481216 aspergirl please believe us when we say that we would never dream of taking you seriously
6481217 some believe that mccain wants to completely overhaul the definition of what it means to be a republican
6481218 some believe that mccain wants to completely overhaul the definition of what it means to be a republican
6481219 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
6481220 because it shows the mccain campaign knows this is not about the base of the party but reaching the middle where the votes are
6481221 the situation with the money is like this he said if i give it to you then you my b your what
6481222 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6481223 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6481224 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
6481225 the los angeles times and ap contributed to this report
6481226 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6481227 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6481228 to me hes ridden the change horse this far in politics and if im him i dont want to get off that horse and i dont worry about shoring up my foreign policy credentials i worry about projecting an image of change
6481229 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6481230 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6481231 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6481232 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6481233 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6481234 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6481235 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6481236 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6481237 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6481238 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6481239 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6481240 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6481241 all the teams are sharing their experiences to ensure we have a very high safety standard
6481242 i can remember coming down here and yelling and screaming its nothing but a party
6481243 we were going to do this and do that while we were following tom landry down the tunnel but i had some sad feelings from the standpoint that this may be the last time that i ever walk down this tunnel
6481244 my first impressions of him when i went against him is that he has great feet and good technique
6481245 its all about going out getting a feel getting some reps and having himself feel comfortable out there once he does that hes going to be one of the best corners in the league
6481246 i didnt know i could steer the receiver wherever i wanted once the quarterback rolled out of the pocket
6481247 there are still a lot of rules i dont know yet once i know all the rules ill be pretty good out there
6481248 from day 1 he went down he came back to practice from doing treatment and he stayed on me
6481249 it shows a lot of class a lot of guys wouldnt do that theyd feel threatened
6481250 once the game starts everybody gets that lather going and youre ready to go out there and play
6481251 you get into a little bit of a groove and then the coaches say youre out
6481252 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6481253 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6481254 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6481255 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6481256 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6481257 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6481258 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6481259 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6481260 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6481261 how much is it worth to you to never see sheila jackson lee on tv again
6481262 i understand that senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
6481263 who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
6481264 this will resonate with a lot of america im not sure of the right tactic to counter this attack but on first glance it would see that having a vp that is closer to the common man might be a good idea
6481265 youll hunt me youll condemn me youll send the dogs on me because thats what needs to happen because sometimes truth isnt good enough sometimes people deserve more sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded
6481266 hes the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now so well hunt him because he can take it because hes because hes not a hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark night
6481267 the one it needs right now he can take it hes a silent guardian a watchful protector
6481268 i will be a pro life president and my administration will have pro life policies
6481269 the one thing i cant do laura and ill talk about anything you want to but the process that were in
6481270 i cant talk about it because if i do i would get down a slippery slope
6481271 the media is making a mistake trying to narrow the issue of vp selection to pro choice or pro life
6481272 that is a vast over simplification typical of the punditry the public will fit the selection into a much broader context that is what the mccain campaign is correctly focused on how the running mate fits into the context of their campaign
6481273 one should not consider mccains potential decision to select a pro choice running mate as an effort to re brand the party the party is pro life and we generate a significant amount of enthusiasm among the rank and file based on that issue position rather mccain picking a pro choice running mate has only to do with his effort to win election not to re brand the party
6481274 while mccain has built his political reputation on his willingness to go against his own party
6481275 the world is waking up to the fact that every molecule of energy that passes into europe is now controlled by a belligerent russia
6481276 obamas got a lot of ground to make up following that performance last weekend at the saddleback presidential forum with pastor rick warren
6481277 im pro infanticide i love sunsets and i dont get the 13th amendment
6481278 well actually my experience in foreign policy is probably more diverse than most others in the field im somebody who has actually lived overseas somebody who has studied overseas i majored in international relations
6481279 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6481280 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6481281 aspergirl please believe us when we say that we would never dream of taking you seriously
6481282 some believe that mccain wants to completely overhaul the definition of what it means to be a republican

6481285 this is one of those books every christian should read breaking the threefold demonic cord
6481286 sandie does not write simply from knowledge or from truths she has learned from other authors and preachers rather this book is based primarily upon truths she has learned by functioning in her god given role as a prophet sandies personal experience and passionate desire to know gods voice and fulfill his word have motivated her to share these wonderful teachings with many saints her unique and interesting style of writing keeps the reader involved in the book until it has been fully assimilated this is one of those books every christian should read
6481287 this book will help pastors leaders and saints who long to move into the fullness of their destiny and inheritance i highly recommend this book
6481288 this book will be a liberating force to set captives free and equip the saints with revelation knowledge and spiritual truth that will enable them to avoid the traps of the enemy
6481289 i loved this book it got my attention from beginning to end destiny thieves is a treasury of swords for any prayer warrior who wants to conquer their enemy
6481290 few contemporary writers offer the insight and understanding that sandie freed shares in her timely and informative work
6481291 sandie freeds book serves as a war manual for those who want to walk in deliberate christianity waging purposeful warfare its for those who want a greater level of the glory of the lord in and through your life it makes a great addition to sandies other powerful books destiny thieves and dream on
6481292 the council unanimously supports the legislation as long as we have a firm 10 million and that the intention of the legislation is to give us 10 million to have beachwood be a park

6481294 it was in my financial self interest to develop as well as the citys
6481295 ab 1991 was a better deal for both the city and for me
6481296 the deal we settled on when we settled this litigation was a or b it was ab 1991 or 18 million and it looks like were going to get b instead of a
6481297 the difficulty with 1991 was that there was so much opposition that there was no way 1991 was going to pass at all the compromise that ive been able to structure i think is a win win for everyone
6481298 hopefully we will now roll up our sleeves and work together as a unified force to get this particular bill passed

6481300 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin
6481301 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
6481302 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
6481303 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
6481304 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury

6481313 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6481314 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6481315 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6481316 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6481317 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6481318 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6481319 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6481320 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6481321 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6481322 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco
6481323 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6481324 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6481325 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6481326 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6481327 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6481328 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6481329 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6481330 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6481331 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6481332 we found that eventually they senesced and were cleared from the liver to protect it from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury
6481333 cell cycle arrest in the cells that generate the fibrosis places a kind of brake on the process limiting how far it can go
6481334 we hypothesize that hscs when they senesce secret less fibrogenic protein and also stimulate a process that tends to degrade proteins that are still present in a lesion
6481335 senescence is a kind of homeostatic mechanism that enables the tissue to return to its pre damaged state
6481336 this may prove to be broadly relevant to other wound healing processes
6481337 random processes could promote job sharing in many different types of organisms
6481338 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

6481365 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6481366 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6481367 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6481368 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6481374 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6481375 the impact of climate change on human and global security could extend far beyond the limited scope the world has seen thus far
6481376 most critical for human survival are water and food which are sensitive to changing climatic conditions
6481377 environmental changes caused by global warming will not only affect human living conditions but may also generate larger societal effects by threatening the infrastructures of society or by inducing social responses that aggravate the problem
6481378 the associated socio economic and political stress can undermine the functioning of communities the effectiveness of institutions and the stability of societal structures these degraded conditions could contribute to civil strife and worse armed conflict
6481379 large areas of africa are suffering from scarcity of food and fresh water resources making them more vulnerable to conflict an example is sudans darfur province where an ongoing conflict was aggravated since droughts forced arab herders to move into areas of african farmers
6481380 although climate change bears a significant conflict potential it can also transform the international system toward more cooperation if it is seen as a common threat that requires joint action
6481381 the bali roadmap has many good ideas but was criticized as being too vague to induce a major policy shift
6481382 nevertheless the seeming conflict between environment and the economy will be best overcome with the recognition that protecting the climate in the best interest of the economy
6481383 history has shown how dependent our culture is on a narrow window of climatic conditions for average temperature and precipitation
6481384 the great human civilizations began to flourish after the last ice age and some disappeared due to droughts and other adverse shifts in the climate
6481385 the consequences were quite severe in parts of europe associated with loss of harvest and population decline
6481386 riots and military conflicts became more likely as a recent empirical study has suggested
6481387 the challenge is to slow down the dynamics and stabilize the climate system at levels which are not dangerous
6481388 global warming receives now more public and political attention than a few years ago
6481389 grass roots movements are emerging in the united states for protecting the climate and developing energy alternatives involving not only many local communities and companies but also influential states such as california led by gov arnold schwarzenegger

6481423 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6481424 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6481425 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6481426 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6481427 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6481428 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6481429 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6481430 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6481431 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6481432 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6481433 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border

6481438 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6481439 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6481440 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6481441 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6481442 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play
6481443 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6481444 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women

6481452 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies

6481455 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6481456 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6481457 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6481458 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6481470 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6481471 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6481472 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6481473 the difference in mood between the liberal blogosphere and the conservative blogosphere is striking
6481474 the democratic campaign in the fall is going to have to be much much tougher than the summer campaign was
6481475 not all is lost folks obama has time and money to make a shift but if you thought that somehow this year was going to be different something would change and somehow the american electorate would look completely different this year than any other year the numbers today just dont show that this isnt a transformative election its another hardscrabble claw out each and every vote election to win that kind of election you need to fight for every vote and fight hard thats why you hear the concern you hear from josh marshall john aravosis joe sudbay etc and its backed up by years of experience watching the republicans make democrats look weak jimmy carter walter mondale al gore and john kerry that line of attack works when not countered and we were defeated none of us want that in 2008
6481476 i dont doubt that obama receives reports about what mccain is saying in speeches and ads and summaries of what the talking heads are saying about obamas reaction to those attacks but my guess is that no one has assembled and screened for him a clip reel of the worst of the worst the stuff that obamas supporters not to mention undecided voters have been seeing if he actually saw that ugly onslaught would he really stick to his high road would he remain content to talk policy and to demur with dignity when mccain and his minions slime him rather than go on the attack and set the agenda himself the last democratic presidential candidate who failed to engage who abjured ruthlessness because it wasnt consistent with the noble kind of politics he wanted america to practice was michael dukakis that misreading of what it takes to win and not the howdy doody tank photo was what sank his campaign
6481477 why hasnt obama gone after mccain why havent we seen some populist fire so clearly in order
6481478 mccains message is pretty clear and essentially twofold 1 obama is in so many words a frivolous phony someone who really doesnt have any business running for president 2 mccain is a strong leader who can defend the country there are all sorts of sub and secondary themes obamas an outsider questionably american etc but all the nitty gritty points are subservient to those two interlocking messages from obama honestly i dont sense a really clear message there are attacks on mccain some of which are quite good there are positive uplifting commercials and there are ads messages targeted to particular states like yucca mountain in nevada and the dhl layoffs in ohio but its hard for me to come up with a clear cut obama message in way that its pretty simple for me to do with mccain even the change message which is the basis of obamas campaign seems much more diffuse to me than it was during the primaries
6481479 beating up on mccain is critical but its not a message in itself and the obama campaign needs to deepen peoples trust in obama not because of all the smears because an outsider running to overturn the status quo always faces trust issues but again not a message for my money the essence of this campaign is are you happy with the way the countrys been run for the last 7 5 years has our foreign policy left us better off republican economic policy you can go through all the different facets but its clear that the public overwhelmingly thinks the bush presidency has been little short of a disaster and do you want four more years of that if thats the frame of the election mccain will be crushed people know they dont want four more years of bush mccain will be another four years of bush its time for change etc thats the essence of the campaign but the message right now seems very muddled
6481480 regardless of how you do the measuring there is a strong argument that if the election were today mccain would win it would be a nail biter either way but for the first time it is arguable that mccain is ahead today
6481481 david gergen real clear politics map showing john mccain moving ahead in the electoral college for the first time this includes leaners and it might be a bit early to start making d c hotel reservations for jan 20 but
6481482 obama is in a free fall mccain got to the heart of the question about obama and especially after the crisis in georgia he has voters wondering whether obama is up to the task of running the presidency as his first executive job in politics even a strong vp pick may not help reverse that perception and could make it worse by overshadowing the nominee democrats may not have been in a weaker position at convention time since 1984
6481483 a large cache of documents housed in the richard j daley library at the university of illinois at chicago uic is likely to flesh out the story not only would these files illuminate the working relationship between obama and bill ayers they would also provide significant insight into a web of ties linking obama to various radical organizations including obama approved foundation gifts to political allies obamas leadership style and abilities are also sure to be illuminated by the documents in question unfortunately i dont yet have access to the documents the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial
6481484 stanley kurtz has done yeomans work trying to uncover the true nature of the relationship between barack obama and weather underground terrorist turned academic william ayers
6481485 for a man with such a meager track record obama and his friends sure seem anxious about anyone checking into it for his experience and his associations a public university operating a public project should provide transparency on these issues and not stall until after the election
6481486 this is a ticking time bomb for the obama campaign they are doing their best through proxies to stop the release of the annenberg records from the university of illinois chicago uic why because as points out the release of the records will fatally undermine obamas narrative about his associations with bill ayers obamas pure as the driven snow despite the terrorists who love me narrative would be destroyed with the release of the annenberg records
6481487 hows that old saying go its the cover up not the crime and we know one individual involved here is already capable of committing a crime with all that cash from the man being available at the center of this lets hope theres no crime involving ayers or anyone else hmm
6481488 i think the democrats may be overstating bidens electoral appeal rasmussen has conducted polling on joe biden at various times and in each case bidens favorables unfavorables were pretty close to even basically i think he is identified enough with the unpopular institution of the congress that he will be viewed by a lot of people as a partisan but doesnt compensate for that by generating enthusiastic responses from the base the way some other candidates might biden is fairly well known by far the best know candidate of the in sen evan bayh biden va gov tim kaine ks gov kathleen sebelius group so perceptions of him are liable to be fairly entrenched and may not be enhanced by the fluffy sort of treatment that the vp candidate usually tends to get from the press there are some positives though bidens numbers are quite strong among seniors a group with whom obama is underperforming and fairly strong among moderates he would probably lock up pennsylvania for obama both because he is well known in the philly burbs and because pennsylvania has an older electorate and might play well somewhere like florida
6481489 the vice presidential trial balloon of the week seems to be joe biden coming on the heels of evan bayh he seems like a huge relief to many but it may be one of those situations where you feel better simply because you stop hitting your head against the wall a lot of the vice presidential choices value boils down to chemistry and obama and biden very well may have it but biden voted for the aumf and the patriot act so all those who thought a vp who undermined obamas message of change would just not be acceptable will no doubt be uncontrollably vexed or not then theres the problem that biden has a history of saying really stupid stuff which could turn out to be a plus i suppose if he draws the flies off obama an unusual election strategy to say the least
6481490 biden has a history of racially insensitive and offensive remarks google biden racism and you get over 440 000 results documenting his racist bloopers selecting biden would be a great way to turn off the black voter base that the democratic party will need to win this election if this guy were a republican democrats would be hanging him out to dry all he needs is a confederate flag to complete the picture were talking major macaca moment potential here and yes as hilarious for ex va sen george allen as that was is obama ready to sign up a vp with a record of racism comments including one aimed straight at himself during the primaries i doubt it
6481491 bidens vote for the bankruptcy bill was unconscionable and the man is a wholly owned subsidiary of the credit card companies the senator from mbna indeed i also find him grating and obnoxious on a personal level and im not sure hed wear well with voters over the long haul nor am i that confident that bidens much vaunted foreign cred is all its cracked up to be not only did he vote for the war but his partition plan for iraq has been condemned by some foreign policy types whose work i respect
6481492 bidens case is probably stronger than i previously indicated because he tends to be most popular among voting groups with a lot of undecided voters which means a lot of persuadables in particular bidens strength with senior citizens could be a real asset how so because seniors are far more likely to be undecided in this election than their younger counterparts what a biden pick really would be is a redux of gore lieberman al gore got quite a large bounce in florida when he selected joe lieberman and if obama were to pick biden he is probably committed to playing florida out to the end or at least until the last 15 days of the campaign
6481493 its certainly true that i could not in good conscience imagine voting for the bankruptcy bill but thats one of the many reasons i wouldnt make it in electoral politics as best i can tell everyone casts unconscionable votes in defense of home state industries certainly im not aware of any senators who are innocent of this particular sin and barack obama coal ethanol is no exception to the general trend i think bidens vote for the 2002 iraq aumf is a serious problem its a bit hard for me to see how obama simultaneously says that his no vote is an important demonstration of good judgment despite a lack of experience and also that joe biden is a great and experienced foreign policy expert maybe theres a brilliant solution to that but it seems tricky to me
6481494 it looks like a toss up right now between biden and kaine given that choice i have a slight preference for kaine ive always liked joe biden but hes too risky for me and i dont agree with him on some major foreign policy issues kaine is a better fit for obamas brand and hell help in virginia which could be a decisive state im not thrilled with kaine either but i prefer him to bayh i still am holding out hope for jack reed or kathleen sebelius id be psyched about either one of them kaine and biden would be just okay bayh would annoy the crap out of me but maybe there will be a big surprise
6481495 kaines positives are that he is from virginia worked as an urban housing rights lawyer speaks spanish was an extremely early obama supporter and opposed the war from the start his negatives are that he has seems pretty right wing bidens strengths are that he is familiar with the national media has recent georgia cred is an excellent debater is a tough attack dog wont become the democratic favorite in the next presidential nomination campaign and is generally his negatives are that he supported the war from the start muddles the change message because he has been in the senate for 36 years is often known as representing mbna instead of delaware including his support for the bankruptcy bill i dont think it is an entirely clear choice biden would almost certainly be a better campaigner and a better president but kaine is far more a reinforcing pick than biden so it is hard to turn away now
6481496 my best guess today as ive said for days now is that obamas choice is surge of concern over the former momentum of evan bayhs selection a wide range of support exists for joe biden tom daschle and evan bayh were called and told they will not be it according to several sources i dont have anything on tim kaine other than insiders tell me that obama has decided against him mostly because he doesnt help check off the foreign policy box or experience box i just dont hear much about kathleen sebelius so am not counting her as a strong candidate but has biden heard a word from obama or his team my sources say no according to one source there has been total radio silence well be thankful for radio silence i guess when other candidates for vp are getting phone calls saying sorry but we look forward to working with you in many other ways in the coming years the word that obama has not communicated with biden makes him in the estimation of many the likely candidate as obama knows that biden will accept on a moments notice i confirmed this with a person very close to the delaware senator
6481497 we know obama likes daschle we know daschle was vetted and we know he has a speaker slot on wed we even know hes floated as a potential cos in the wh it makes sense too of the whole vp process weve been watching unfold for obama
6481498 mayhill has been following kerry on the stump off and on for the past few weeks and has seen a man transformed a man infused with an energy and enthusiasm even a lightness of spirit that balance nicely with his unshakable gravitas it may be a desire to return the favors karl rove and the swiftboaters dealt him in 2004 it may be that kerry is sincerely impressed and energized by the prospect of an obama camelot we think its both whatever is inspiring kerry lately however its indisputable that kerry is inspired and some inspiration is what barack obama needs and may well have chosen to add to his ticket
6481499 sebelius of course would be the bold unconventional choice very obama but by choosing a female running mate obama would unfortunately thrust the hillary die hards and their ever more marginal discontentment back into the spotlight that said anyone who believes that only hillary clinton deserves to be the first female president or vice president doesnt deserve the designation feminist so id relish watching the reactions to a sebelius nod not only because such a choice would double down on obamas most effective message change but because it would reveal exactly which clinton boosters are ready to widen the lens and enthusiastically support womens leadership as such
6481500 in general i think it makes sense for a republican presidential nominee to leave open the possibility of picking a pro choice running mate but ultimately to pick a pro lifer kathryn jean lopez has been suggesting that mccain is doing just that right now if so i fear his campaign has misplayed the issue at this point if mccain picks a pro lifer wont his opponents say he was browbeat by the far right
6481501 news reports say that john mccain is keeping joe lieberman in the running for vp thats fine with me not because i think mccain will pick lieberman if he does hes so openly disrespectful of the policies and priorities of his base and so dismissive of his need for their support that his judgment is in question but keeping lieberman in the mix even as conservatives like me reiterate our strong opposition to a democrat as veep on the republican ticket plays well for mccain its designed to send a message to independents just as his supposed openness to a pro choice running mate was supposed to reassure pumas hes using the veep process to re establish his credentials as a maverick who may not always toe the gop line without actually moving left on any policies and if talking up ct sen joe lieberman helps him in florida hes not averse to that either
6481502 to me lieberman wouldnt be the best pick but he wouldnt be the worst either there is much to commend the do no harm vp calculus lieberman wouldnt be a do no harm pick if you do the static analysis is lieberman better than say rob portman its all wrong the difference is that any of the conventional picks dont help mccain with his 1 priority winning the election despite narrowing the gap mccain is currently about 3 points behind he needs a better vp pick than obama will come up with and unless obama chooses clinton obamas pick will be safe and milquetoast lieberman is the most obvious opportunity to shake up the calculus of the race picking him did something for al gore in 2000 taking him from a sure loser to a position of strength in the fall a conservative vp on a losing ticket is still a losing ticket
6481503 the addition of joe lieberman will not convince independents that mccain is a maverick it will convince an already skeptical gop base that mccain is a rino patrick knows better than most how essential enthusiasm is to the gotv efforts and fundraising mccain appears to have finally generated some of that enthusiasm and picking lieberman would snuff it out for good republicans respect lieberman but they dont want a liberal democrat as the person who would succeed to the presidency if something happened to mccain which is the entire point of the vice presidency lieberman may not be the worst choice but hes close to it if mccain wants a democrat let him pick john breaux whose positions really do reflect conservative values otherwise the republican party has plenty of options for a republican ticket
6481504 should senator john mccain choose a pro choice running mate we are comfortably enough in touch with the republican base to say without hesitation that the majority of the base would sit this race out and we could not blame them for it
6481505 mccain doesnt need any bank shots or game changers he needs what was on display saturday night at saddleback a confidence in the rightness of center right ideas across a range of issues and of course a deep belief in american exceptionalism a conventional but base energizing choice mitt romney or tim pawlenty will keep the momentum going and reveal no deficit of confidence in mccains ideas or the core ideas of his party
6481506 happy now the network will be formally announcing this tomorrow but i am pleased to inform you in this fully authorized leak that as of monday september 8 our mutual friend ms maddow will become host of her own show on msnbc at 9 pm eastern time
6481507 an hour of olbermann then an hour of maddow thats going to make watching msnbc so much more fun
6481508 this is proof that even in todays disgusting nepotistic and cutthroat media world a world that too often rewards idiocy and the idiots that spout the idiocy good things can happen to good people
6481509 well this is just great news rachel is one of the smartest people i know a great broadcaster and an all around cool person so shell certainly bring light to important stories otherwise ignored by everyone else in cable news but rachel will also draw an audience not necessarily predisposed to liberalism with rachel on the air viewers will get the opportunity to watch real news instead of bluster and i bet a sizable number will jump at the chance
6481510 jen rubin argues for the mccain one term pledge of which i believe ramesh ponnuru has been the strongest proponent theres a lot in what they argue but im not convinced yet i probably could be if i knew mccain were going to pick a veep who would energize conservatives both this year and as the 2012 heir apparent for us the biggest problem with a mccain presidency whether one or two terms would be its front loaded nature mccains greatest service to conservatives would be beating obama that is no small thing but it is one that would be fully accomplished even before mccain took office after that what leverage would we have if mccain had run on a one term pledge he wouldnt need us to be re elected and he has demonstrated in the past that building a conservative republican party for the future is not a top priority for him hed want to ring up some presidential accomplishments and the democrats with increased numbers in congress would be the only game in town the one term pledge would certainly help mccain big time with hillary democrats and independents if he picks a good veep the pledge could help mccain with us it could even help him with at least some in the media for whom the prospect of covering you decide 2012 for four full years beginning this november might be even more irresistable than obama all in all it would increase his chances of getting elected i concede that this is no small thing in light of the frightening specter of an obama presidency maybe its the most important thing but as far as governing goes i dont see much in it for mccain or for us
6481511 im hearing that tensions were high recently when veteran actor robert duvall was taping a voice over for a video to be played during the republican national convention apparently the veteran actor objected to the direction he was receiving from republican media guru fred davis according to my sources duvall said something along the lines of f you fred if scorsese couldnt give me direction what the hell makes you think you can though this blow up is actually recorded on tape my guess is its in everyones best interest for this to not leak out
6481512 we were talking about hillary clinton but i dont know if it should be to tell you the truth just because i think that would really split the vote
6481513 i dont think a lot of hillary clintons people that liked her would go for the fact that she is teaming up with barack obama
6481514 if you are going to lead the way you have to choose the one that you are in the same wavelength
6481515 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6481516 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6481517 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6481518 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6481519 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6481520 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6481521 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6481522 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6481523 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6481524 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
6481525 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
6481526 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
6481527 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
6481528 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
6481529 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
6481530 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
6481531 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
6481532 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
6481533 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
6481534 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
6481535 im starting to suspect that the evan bayh boomlet is designed to make tim kaine look better by comparison because really evan bayh is about the only democrat who makes tim kaine look palatable by comparison as obamas veep
6481536 of the people i dont really want to be veep who keep showing up on those fake short lists people keep coming up with he bothers me the least
6481537 personally i still think those significant negatives would make her a terrible pick unfortunately im resigned to obama making a terrible pick with someone else anyway biden bayh kaine so if its between one of those three terrible picks or clinton i throw my hands up in the air
6481538 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6481539 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill

6481578 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
6481579 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6481580 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6481581 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6481582 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6481583 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6481584 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6481585 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6481586 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6481587 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6481588 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6481589 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6481590 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6481591 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6481592 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6481593 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6481594 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6481595 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6481596 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6481597 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6481598 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6481599 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6481600 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6481601 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6481602 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6481603 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6481604 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6481605 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6481606 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6481607 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6481608 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6481609 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6481610 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6481611 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6481612 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6481613 with this early notification the intent is for the majority of employees to take this time off to improve on the efficiencies achieved in 2008
6481614 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6481615 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buy backs to the investors
6481616 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable
6481617 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6481618 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6481619 the differences between the two types of motors have both construction implications and mechanical environmental how the motorcycle is driven as well as construction and maintenance cost issues mechanically the two stroke engine is simple the piston with its alternating motion opens and closes the ports of the intake and exhaust from which the mixture of air petrol and oil and exhaust gases enters and leaves in comparison the four stroke motor is complex and heavier than its two stroke equivalent the upper part of the engine is the head which holds the intake and exhaust valves driven by camshafts engine power comes from petrol shot into the engine via injectors the lubrication of the two strokes engine crankshaft and connecting rods is entrusted to the fuel the power is normally governed by a carburettor that has a mechanical operation typically controlled by the depression created by the movement of the piston the lubrication of the various mechanisms of the four strokes is entrusted to oil and this can be collected in a reservoir built in the lower part of the engine called a sump which can either be a dry or wet sump depending on whether the oil is collected in a separate tank
6481620 the maintenance and alteration of a two stroke is very different from a four stroke and can be carried out completely in the field given the simple nature of its construction historically these changes used to be made by the team even in satellite squads the maintenance of the four stroke is complex and only factory technicians are entrusted to work on the engine while mechanics from satellite teams are only allowed to do maintenance that doesnt involve opening up the engines
6481621 the peculiarity of the two stroke engine in principle is that it produces very little torque low down in the rev range but lots at high revs in 500ccgps maximum torque was very close to that of maximum power on the rev counter but in modern motogp the release of both torque and power is more linear and more progressive and so is more exploitable and has wider powerband than that of a two stroke to give the two stroke more flexibility exhaust powervalves were adopted to broaden where the power and torque came in giving more drive when you opened the gas the differences on the track were that riding the two strokes smoothness on the throttle and through the corner was the best way to ride and the bike had almost no engine braking and the weight of the machine was lower too in motogp you can break the smooth trajectory through the corner as youve so much torque and power you can accelerate away out of the turn with a 500 the acceleration phase was the most delicate operation because the violence with which the power came in meant that rider error would lead to sudden loss of adhesion of the rear tyre and a subsequent classic high side the two stroke motorcycles required sensitivity from the rider especially on the throttle with the four strokes the relatively large amount of power is offset by the electronic management and traction control system this year for example beginners in the motogp class coming from the 250cc two stroke category have adapted quickly getting good results in the race although they are generally the riders who have been the best in the category they have just left
6481622 since this new adventure there were unknowns not only to the development of the motorcycle but this new technology also demanded a different way of working from the team
6481623 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6481624 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6481625 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6481626 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6481627 on one hand i didnt want my career to end this way
6481628 if i chose to end it thats one thing it was a relief in that regard and it was what i thought it was and it was what the doctors thought it was so that was good
6481629 ja ich hatte eine sch nheits operation meine nase wurde gemacht
6481630 das war wie ein st ck kaugummi ich konnte es immer reindr cken es war so als h tte ich einen dauer pickel auf der nase
6481631 als er mit dem eingriff fertig war sah die nase gr er aus als vorher
6481632 denn der knochenkalk hat sich durch den eingriff irgendwie aufgestaut dadurch bekam ich einen richtigen h cker auf der rechten seite meiner nase echt total asozial
6481633 er hat mir einfach meine alte nase wieder geschenkt nur ohne das knubbelchen darauf
6481634 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
6481635 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
6481636 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
6481637 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
6481638 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
6481639 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
6481640 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
6481641 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
6481642 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6481643 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6481644 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6481645 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6481646 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6481647 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6481648 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6481649 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6481650 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6481651 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6481652 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6481653 often the things that smell the worst do in fact taste the best
6481654 guys i never want to see lobbing grenades at me again

6481656 capacity development for pro poor private sector led growth through enhancing corporate governance
6481657 the development of the small and medium scale enterprise sector is particularly important for employment creation and equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity and thus poverty reduction
6481658 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6481659 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6481660 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6481661 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6481662 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6481663 im 9 5er bereich abgesehen davon dass er 20 meter vor dem ziel abbremste
6481664 er wirds machen und hat versprochen es wird in sechs jahren sein
6481665 den schei 100 meter lauf gucke ich mir nicht mehr an wir versuchen hier alles mit fairen mitteln und dann kommen da leute her und machen sich einen spa draus mit ansage zu gewinnen weil sie wissen dass man ihnen nichts anhaben kann
6481666 man kann nicht unter 9 80 sekunden laufen ohne die richtigen mittel
6481667 dieses argument ist eine gigantische globale volksverdummung bei olympischen spielen selbst lassen sich nur idioten erwischen

6481671 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going
6481672 i think he wants to make sure he gets it checked out and make sure everything is all right with it when hes been able to practice and move around hes looked awfully good to me
6481673 the vehicle was an absolute disgrace and undoubtedly unfit for the lake it could have created an absolute tragedy
6481674 the dangers of fare paying passengers taking a ride on the lake in an unsuitable vehicle are obvious i hope that by taking this action weve averted a future tragedy
6481675 this caused myself and my family extreme financial hardship over the last three years and deprived us of our savings and livelihood whilst leaving us with huge debts
6481676 we are constrained to again plead with the government to avail itself of other suggestions in that paper all of which will only work together for the benefit of our people and ultimately the good of our country
6481677 with national revenue at record post war level and the government experiencing budgetary surpluses the government can afford to also waive some taxes and fees associated with the importation of basic consumer commodities like rice petroleum products and cement
6481678 government must now use funds from the rice stabilization account to reduce the price of rice on the liberian market
6481679 for russia control of georgia and the pipeline would restore much of its influence over many of the former satellites of the u s s r
6481680 it would have the clear benefit of increasing russias energy chokehold on europe
6481681 im sure the u s will bring in more oil and especially more liquefied natural gas from russia the russian government is ready to take it to the next level
6481682 hopefully the american government and big business will recognize that russia brings a transparent structure to the table and we can discuss more mega projects with westerners russian assets are undervalued right now
6481683 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
6481684 ich habe noch gar keine zeit gehabt bei mir anzukommen
6481685 all the terms and conditions must be negotiated on an individual basis
6481686 arrangements with the artists guilds and unions prohibit us from making them available in any other form
6481687 part of what was stipulated and set up upfront was that there would be a limited amount of showings
6481688 they mtv were allowed i believe six airings over a six week period and once that was done it was done
6481689 fell in love with it and thought it would be absolutely perfect for the mtv audience
6481690 we looked at the pros and cons and realized that the demographic that mtv speaks to is a demographic for our show
6481691 its one thing to have a film come out which is quite different from what you experience when you see it onstage
6481692 in this instance the mtv special was obviously what you see onstage so as long as the show is running we didnt really have any interest to have a dvd out there for the general public to purchase our interest is in having them come see the show either on broadway or on the national tour which launches this fall and if at some point further down the line years from now if that becomes of interest we would have to go to the studio and all of the different unions to see if this is something everyone wants to do
6481693 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
6481694 the possibility of a block is high and id say it should be due to a content issue
6481695 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6481696 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6481697 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6481698 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6481699 those responsible say that it will take two days at the most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints dna identification will take a bit more
6481700 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6481701 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6481702 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6481703 do i have to change my name will it get me far

6481716 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6481717 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6481718 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6481719 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6481720 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6481721 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6481722 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6481723 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6481724 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6481725 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6481726 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6481727 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6481728 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6481729 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6481730 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6481731 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6481732 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6481733 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6481734 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6481735 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6481736 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6481737 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6481738 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6481739 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6481740 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6481741 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6481742 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6481743 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6481744 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6481745 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6481746 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6481747 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6481748 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

6481753 but maybe sean hannity doesnt know the first thing about how college works because the only college degree he ever earned was an honorary degree from liberty university given to him by none other than jerry falwell
6481754 the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6481755 the little screw and the commodity wiring became a munition
6481756 you are using an extremely blunt instrument for sophisticated policy needs
6481757 sped up the inevitable proliferation of advanced technology by forcing other countries to find other means of obtaining satellite components that had previously been manufactured only in the united states
6481758 the problem is that today you can buy international equivalents that are as good as what american industry is producing
6481759 offsets globalisation foreign industrial priorities and policy even the domestic corporate tax structure
6481760 the academic world is used to sharing and it really makes it hard for scientific exchange nobody wants to be slapped with a gigantic fee or go to jail it is scaring everyone into not talking and thats crippling for science

6481782 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6481783 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6481784 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6481785 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6481786 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6481787 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6481788 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6481789 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6481790 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6481791 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6481792 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6481793 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6481794 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6481795 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6481796 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6481797 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6481798 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6481799 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6481800 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6481801 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6481802 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6481803 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6481804 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6481805 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6481806 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6481807 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6481808 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6481809 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6481810 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6481811 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6481812 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6481813 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6481814 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6481815 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6481816 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6481817 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6481818 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6481819 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6481820 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6481821 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6481822 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6481823 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6481824 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6481825 one day dear well be able to get a car like that load up the kids and take our own trip ill work more hours at the factory for a while and then its off to the coast hows snorkeling sound to you

6481829 awny is the most committed well organized and respected organization of its kind in the country
6481830 i was so impressed with pam hamlin the president of arnold worldwide and the amazing story she told of her group working as a team to grow and achieve really great things at what would have seemed the toughest of times for the agency having just experienced significant client loss the ability to rebuild and to achieve such great success was quite inspiring mary beth west cmo of kraft talked about her passion for her job for her company and most importantly for her customer and i think we can all take a page from that play book and put it to good use and of course the consistent theme voiced by so many of the honorees the importance of teamwork of building a business environment that supports and nurtures employees in order to get the best thinking and the highest degree of creativity the takeaway for me talent isnt necessarily born talent is nurtured
6481831 media brands are increasingly defined less by the platform and more by the community the media landscape has changed forever and social media is certainly ubiquitous our challenge is to remember that the community already exists and our job as media brands is to think about how we can help the community do what it wants to do to listen to them and understand what they need then we can create more tools and more content to help them the goal the more we engage them the more loyal theyll be the more often theyll return and more often and loudly theyll broadcast us to others
6481832 im not sure i agree we have a real struggle in doing that i think women are pretty routinely called out for their amazing abilities to nurture initiatives in communities in their families in philanthropic endeavors but what women need help in doing is seeing those same qualities propel them to corporate success to the same degree and in the equal percentage as men having women represent over 50 of college graduates today and yet still finding fewer than 5 of them leading fortune 500 corporations tells me we still arent there
6481833 wow where do i start you had best be nimble extremely open to change love working in a rapidly shifting environment be prepared to learn something new about your customer every day and don t come with pre conceived notions about consumers theyll surprise you every time

6481835 resolution by two thirds majority of the liberian senate removing isaac nyenabo from position of president pro tempore of the liberian senate
6481836 we the undersigned duly seated senators of the liberian senate of the 52nd legislature constituting two thirds of the entire membership of the liberian senate do hereby conscientiously and unequivocally declare an irreversible and explicit vote of no confidence in the leadership of senator isaac nyenabo as president pro tempore of the liberian senate principally for gross administrative ineptitude
6481837 himself both in the public and private domain in manners and forms that have brought the integrity and credibility of the liberian senate into question
6481838 his administrative ineptitude has also become glaring as a result of his failure to take responsibility for actions he initiates once said actions are brought to scrutiny
6481839 it is acknowledged beyond all reasonable doubts that the activities and utterances of senator isaac w nyenabo as president pro tempore have impugned on the moral rectitude of the senate
6481840 we have resolved to dispossess senator isaac nyenabo of the confidence which we earlier reposed in him with this popular declaration he shall cease to serve or function as president pro tempore

6481845 another major housing related write off by a bank or series of banks in the u s or u k or possibly fre problems
6481846 it may not turn out to be the case but until the market receives some evidence that there wont be bad news up ahead a lot of money is coming out of assets and going back into the yen
6481847 were also seeing some selling ahead of the last week of august which is a big vacation week but the major factor here is concern about housing and mortgage backed assets
6481848 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6481849 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6481850 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6481851 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6481852 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6481853 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6481854 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6481855 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6481856 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6481857 nature intended that we take a nap in the middle of the day

6481860 we are not familiar with the process by which elected precinct committeemen are removed from office
6481861 were not even sure our bylaws contemplate such a situation if such a remedy is available it should be immediately pursued if it does not we should at a minimum adopt a resolution asking for mr readys immediate resignation
6481862 we simply cannot allow mr ready to serve out his term even if that term were to expire next week we need to take action now and send a message that such behavior has no place in the republican party
6481863 who can get this letter together and do this thing to a precinct committeeman that lives in the third world here thats not even going to be in office in three weeks if hes moving what is the point you know what i mean if im going to be the proverbial whipping boy there must be a reason
6481864 a call to campaign finance director kristi passarelli at maricopa county elections confirmed ready was telling the truth about his pc ship
6481865 sean mccaffrey executive director of the state gop told the taloned one the party was unaware of readys republican position he vowed ready will be asked to step down if ready refuses the party will field candidates for his pc ship in 08 when readys terms up to make sure readys not re elected

6481867 it is hoped that this event will provide white nationalist parents with an opportunity to meet and network with one another
6481868 and will provide the children of those parents with an opportunity to make some new friends within their own community having a blast in the process
6481869 white nationalists who are not parents are also encouraged to attend

6481885 the battle over whos the real elitist here is one that many dems have wanted the obama campaign to wade into and now theyre getting their way
6481886 people have come to me with other ideas but lingerie is a passion for me and just like music and acting i cant do it unless i put 100 percent into it
6481887 it makes you feel incredible and offers variety as diverse as the women who will wear it
6481888 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us

6481894 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
6481895 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6481896 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
6481897 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6481898 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6481899 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6481900 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6481901 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6481902 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6481903 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6481904 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6481905 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6481906 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6481907 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6481908 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6481909 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6481910 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6481911 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6481912 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense

6481920 we know our audience is interested in reading a little bit about foreign and national news but by far our research and all our readers tell us that local news and pop culture news is what they want

6481923 i had no idea there were so many transactions or it was so much i probably tried to wipe as many from my memory as i could
6481924 ive got nothing to show for it i bought nothing with it
6481925 ive had to live with hell for years i dont know what else i can say i just want to die
6481926 they were messing about in the house and i was having a bad day and i just lost it
6481927 i was holding them under the water in the bathroom
6481928 the police found a bath full of water with a lot of black fur floating on the top and a cats collar blood and a lock knife on the bathroom floor upstairs
6481929 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
6481930 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
6481931 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6481932 can nominate or try and nominate anyone he wants he is in fact the leader of the party now going forward but it would be a very bumpy road
6481933 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6481934 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6481935 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously
6481936 the main point is the timing of how quickly they offer the buy backs to the investors
6481937 we want that done quickly and they had a voluntary time frame that was not acceptable
6481938 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question
6481939 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6481940 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6481941 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity vs productivity
6481942 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
6481943 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
6481944 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6481945 i was too hard on myself towards the end of the match as i was so keen to win i feel very regretful about losing the first three games so easily
6481946 but when i was close to victory i actually started to become shaky and to lose confidence i became more conservative because i was scared of losing the fourth game
6481947 i have great respect for him he played very well he is fantastic what can i say
6481948 ive been saying for a long time that the 200 meters means a lot more to me than the 100
6481949 ive been dreaming about the 200 since i was yea high im real happy with myself real proud right now
6481950 i wish i was in sandals right now just taking the weekend and going to the quarter
6481951 hes not what we sprinters should look like he could possibly do the same thing in the 400
6481952 we never thought a man would run a 9 6 and he did it we never thought a man would run 19 3 and he did it how fast can a man go before he can go no faster
6481953 hes so good because hes 6 5 and he runs like hes 5 9
6481954 hes a phenom said american walter dix who took the bronze
6481955 the guy is bad he came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6481956 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he reaches his proverbial prime
6481957 hes a baby as he gets stronger it will get scary we will all want to say we saw the evolution
6481958 hes doing things that no man of his stature could do and its a beautiful thing and hes beautiful to watch the stride it is poetry in motion
6481959 hes blessed with a unique anatomy a huge competitive heart and hes having a good time
6481960 anything is possible if i put my mind to it
6481961 im looking forward to my birthday actually im 22 now
6481962 so im looking forward to going to sleep with double world records
6481963 the fact that parties behave as though a trial court has jurisdiction over the case does not confer jurisdiction on a court

6482048 he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness
6482049 his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real

6482069 shes been open in telling us she would like to spend time overseas and that is her right
6482070 but i dont think it would be with us she has been talking to cnn and to be honest overseas positions are limited at seven

6482106 investment in china has been boosted by the governments energy policy which secures renewable energy as a vital and important part of the countrys energy mix

6482225 it is good to rub and polish our brain against that of others
6482226 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6482227 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6482228 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6482229 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6482230 he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness
6482231 his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real
6482232 counting the afl championship in 1967 and victories in super bowls xi and xv upshaw became the only player ever to start on championship teams in both the afl and nfl
6482233 this was not a shooting that was a random act it was not random in nature

6482243 it is my strong belief that we need to begin doing so immediately if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
6482244 the climax of a 3 1 2 year effort to persuade the president to send more troops to iraq

6482250 i accept that over the years there may have been persons involved in questionable activities with questionable associations who have passed through the centre from time to time

6482256 ik heb voor deze opleiding gekozen omdat het zo ontzettend breed is je leert een hoop over veel verschillende dingen omdat ik nog geen idee heb wat ik wil gaan doen later maar wel weet dat deze richting me trekt leek deze opleiding mij geschikt
6482257 ja ik ben het hier nog steeds mee eens zeker in dit eerste jaar hebben we al heel veel verschillende dingen gedaan op die manier raak je goed geori nteerd het is daarmee dus ook wel ongeveer wat ik verwacht had
6482258 ik zou het oprecht nog niet weten ik ben wat dat betreft echt een laatbloeier ik probeer gewoon zo goed mogelijk te kijken wat me ligt en wat niet en me dan uiteindelijk meer toe te spitsen op de dingen waar ik goed in ben op die manier hoop ik dan uiteindelijk een baan te vinden die bij me past
6482259 minder leuk aan de opleiding vind ik het feit dat wij als bedrijfscommunicatiestudenten zo tussen de andere studies aan de fcj hangen we hebben niet onze eigen docenten en faciliteiten dit komt natuurlijk ook doordat deze studie pas 2 jaar bestaat maar toch kan het wel eens vervelende situaties opleveren bijvoorbeeld docenten die maar amper tijd voor je kunnen maken omdat ze het nu nog drukker hebben met ons erbij

6482262 the statement that mr franken wants to eliminate the secret ballot is not factually false since the efca will eliminate the secret ballot vote for union organizing elections where a majority of employees sign union authorization cards because mr franken supports the efca the statement franken says eliminate the secret ballot for workers is not false
6482263 with every national and state political wind at his back this race should be al frankens to lose
6482264 first came accounts of his failure to pay workers compensation insurance in new york and that he was late paying income taxes in 17 states

6482270 it really is very important to be aware of changes in laws that are likely to affect your business
6482271 its not often that you get to know about laws being changed unless youre on the lookout for that
6482272 the number of calls i get from people who want marketing advice but are already in trouble and dont have money to pay for that advice i think goes up in troubled times
6482273 if your marketing is strong when times are good the down turns are not going to affect you as dramatically as those companies that have not prepared themselves
6482274 there are a vast number of companies out there that feel that planning is maybe over rated not that necessary
6482275 you look at all the successful companies and those are the guys that have really planned
6482276 hargroves appearance will generate great interest as he truly is one of those thinkers at the forefront of canadian manufacturing
6482277 were absolutely thrilled that both our papers have brought home such fantasic results
6482278 serving our clients has always been the top priority for our publications and giving them a first rate product in which to do their advertising is what we always strive for
6482279 our other first place awards best advertising and promotional materials goodlife magazine rate card best single black and white rop ad important nissan clearout best real estate and new homes section and best kids publication for pop from paton publishing were extremely gratifying
6482280 our recognition across the various areas of advertising and promotion shows the strength in our talent in all areas
6482281 with the celebration of our 25th anniversary this year plus wins and high placings as the best business publication its been a great year for the paper
6482282 serving both our advertisers and our readers has always been the top priority at our paper
6482283 its all about what id like to ask him tell me how to set that up a meeting with bush and i would be there in a heartbeat
6482284 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong
6482285 i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6482286 its my way of giving back to the community who has supported me since i moved here to mississauga
6482287 if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
6482288 john recognized early on that more troops would be needed in order to achieve the security necessary for the iraqis to make the political progress were seeing now
6482289 he supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign for president he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct
6482290 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6482291 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6482292 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6482293 a misguided initiative that uses deliberately misleading information to confuse the public
6482294 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6482295 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6482296 countless lives have been saved since congress raised the national minimum drinking age to 21 in 1984 we need to maintain this important law
6482297 our experience as college and university presidents convinces us that 21 is not working
6482298 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6482299 we call upon our elected officials to support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
6482300 we are against intoxication we are for responsible adult behavior when it comes to alcohol
6482301 the data overwhelmingly show that the vast majority of young people by the time they reach college age have already have some exposure to alcohol
6482302 there is a perfect storm of affluence opportunity and tolerance on college campuses
6482303 ik was aangenaam verrast met het verzoek van de scriptschrijvers
6482304 dat geeft wat mij betreft aan dat er van drastische bezuinigingen geen sprake is
6482305 ik kan me voorstellen dat het voor haar een enorme teleurstelling was om de set waar ze al jaren werkte te moeten verlaten maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat ze goed terecht zal komen
6482306 ik ben trouwens erg trots op johnny hij heeft zijn draai bij waar is de mol volgens mij helemaal gevonden

6482308 were starting to see the prices jump and what 150 000 could get you last year is not going to get you near this year
6482309 today our family and the entire football world is saddened and feels a great loss
6482310 our friend gene upshaw was a dynamic leader on and off the field gene was a pioneer one of the first african american leaders of a major union he was the equal of the owners in negotiations he championed many causes which made the league a better place
6482311 the union is in place to protect the players not the owners if the union isnt doing its job it shouldnt be there
6482312 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come all of us in the nfl reach out with our sympathy to terri and the upshaw family

6482324 the basic message was that people coming to this country should adapt
6482325 this wasnt a hateful e mail but one that touched upon a sentiment in this country and around the world that immigrants have to adapt to their new homes
6482326 we in the muslim american community are part of the american fabric and these kinds of messages that speak to promote intolerance and suspicion are anti american not just anti muslim

6482328 sinn f in recently carried out a survey in the belfast rd area of the city regarding a loyalist band competition which is to take place on 29th august the results of the survey revealed that 88 9 of residents are opposed to the march
6482329 the people of this area are entitled to have their voices heard in relation to these matters and the parade organisers need to begin a genuine process of negotiation with the residents
6482330 ptt ptt ptt and a lot of mouthing of words for game play talk or worse no game play just sex talk and or play no fun to update i can tell you that
6482331 i have written some astonishingly banal columns in my life and some very personal ones
6482332 it is not true that anyone can write it is not true that anyone can write on deadline it is not true that anyone can do an interview but the odds of them doing it are greatly increased if they havent already filed 1 200 words to the web shot a video done a podcast and blogged ferociously all day long
6482333 when my cohort first started out we would get actual letters often written in beautiful handwriting on creamy stationery in the blogosphere what follows isnt usually a conversation but a brief ungrammatical shouting match you can have more pensive chats in a bar fight
6482334 and journalism wasnt meant to be a conversation anyway it was maybe a monologue at its most democratic a carefully constructed dialogue if readers didnt like or agree with the monologues in paper a they bought paper b what was most important about their opinions was that they thought enough to spend the coin

6482354 most of the time it is at the end of the hall where the armoury is situated two years ago we found a dagger that had come out of the ground outside the armoury
6482355 i have also seen someone walk towards the end of the building they moved without any motion at all as if they were on a conveyor belt the shape was blurred but it was definitely a figure and definitely moving
6482356 i have heard flute music coming from inside the hall and when i am in the armoury i always feel someone is with me there is a presence behind me on my right shoulder i know what i see and id like to know more
6482357 this is one of the best investigations that i have been on for a very long time
6482358 it has been a really interesting investigation and i am pleased that the news brought along an independent psychic who has come up with very much the same feelings as the paranormal team

6482378 the council unanimously supports the legislation as long as we have a firm 10 million and that the intention of the legislation is to give us 10 million to have beachwood be a park
6482379 im grateful to the senator and the leadership in the senate for coming up with this solution
6482380 it was in my financial self interest to develop as well as the citys
6482381 ab 1991 was a better deal for both the city and for me
6482382 the deal we settled on when we settled this litigation was a or b it was ab 1991 or 18 million and it looks like were going to get b instead of a
6482383 the difficulty with 1991 was that there was so much opposition that there was no way 1991 was going to pass at all the compromise that ive been able to structure i think is a win win for everyone
6482384 hopefully we will now roll up our sleeves and work together as a unified force to get this particular bill passed
6482385 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6482386 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6482387 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

6482389 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6482390 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6482391 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6482392 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

6482394 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6482395 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6482396 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6482397 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6482398 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6482399 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6482400 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6482401 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

6482403 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6482404 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6482405 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6482406 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6482407 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6482408 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6482409 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6482410 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6482411 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6482412 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6482413 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6482414 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6482415 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6482416 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6482417 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6482418 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6482419 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6482420 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6482421 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6482422 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6482423 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6482424 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6482425 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6482426 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6482427 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6482428 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6482429 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6482430 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6482431 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6482432 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6482433 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6482434 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6482435 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6482436 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6482437 yeah been through it its all good its great im really excited
6482438 what we would expect is that theyll trade for a while below fair value
6482439 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6482440 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6482441 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6482442 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6482443 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6482444 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6482445 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6482446 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6482447 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6482448 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6482449 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6482450 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6482451 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6482452 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6482453 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6482454 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6482455 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6482456 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6482457 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6482458 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6482459 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6482460 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6482461 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6482462 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6482463 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6482464 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6482465 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6482466 i was with him but we didnt speak about that topic together i think hes going to do the best for his career and i wish him good luck for the future
6482467 i have no clue about his future as i didnt ask him about his plans
6482468 what i know is that hes happy playing for real madrid the best team in the world and everything he does is very well
6482469 i have no idea whether he is going to hang up his boots there or not

6482473 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6482474 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6482475 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6482476 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

6482478 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6482479 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6482480 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6482481 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6482482 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6482485 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6482486 this is a planning took where all things are going
6482487 the fact that u s territory could be threatened from remote regions of the world forced a reassessment of washingtons security policy as a result the entire planet became a sphere of vital u s interests
6482488 a holistic outlook on global leadership was formed in the united states a period when washington could act without taking the interests of others into account is over and the attempt to implement this established policy has led to a series of failures and to a new level of global fragmentation it also has demonstrated the limitations of the united states ability to influence global affairs unilaterally
6482489 is irritated the most when the united states interferes in those areas in which moscow believes washington has no strategic interests moreover washington is not prepared to impose limitations on itself squeezing everyone else wherever it can
6482490 regions that moscow sees as secondary to u s interests have become necessary components of the complex u s structure known as american leadership
6482491 in different parts of the world from latin america to africa and from the middle east to the far east with the help of these instruments russia will pursue its strategic interests in europe and asia
6482492 it hoped that its expansion in russias backyard would go smoothly and not be very costly from a geopolitical point of view but the u s did not seriously consider the consequences of defending these new allies both politically and militarily and it turned out that at the critical moment the u s was not in a position to give substantive support to its ally georgia it was even unable to prevent georgia from making fatal mistakes
6482493 with the russia georgia military conflict the united states clearly fell into a dangerous trap
6482494 told the media that the worsening economic situation in the u s could not be turned around in a short time and that the united states huge overseas military operations are also increasing pressures on the economy washington will sooner or later have to get its soldiers out of different countries such as iraq hashemi said
6482495 to restore the united states to its proper world leadership role two areas of weakness must be repaired the domestic economy and the united states reputation in the world although the economy is usually treated as a domestic issue reviving it is as important to the nations long term security as is keeping u s military strength unchallengeable this will require more than a cyclical upturn to repair the economy in the long term a new national policy on energy and climate change will be essential and restoring respect for american values and leadership is essential not because it is nice to be popular but because respect is a precondition for legitimate leadership and enduring influence
6482496 issuing a clear official ban on torture and closing the detention facility at guant namo bay cuba because the bush administration limited itself to punishing only those at the very bottom of the chain of command at abu ghraib the damage to the united states image has been immense and continuing the gift that keeps on giving to the united states enemies as for guant namo closing it is complicated as bush administration apologists and many lawyers say well a lot of things in life are complicated guant namo must not become the next presidents albatross too closing it no matter how difficult is not just desirable but imperative
6482497 efforts so far to encourage moderate muslims to deal with extremists have not worked a new creative approach to public diplomacy must be developed then there is the odd problem posed by the democracy agenda of the last six years bush did the dream of democracy a huge disservice by linking it to the assertion of u s military power pressuring other countries to adopt the superficial aspects of a complex and subtle system of governance is simply not the route to follow in promoting american values or security interests yet the goal is correct and should not be abandoned only presented in a style and a tone far more sensitive to how it is perceived in other lands the next administration should focus more on human rights a phrase curiously absent from the bush lexicon and basic human needs while still encouraging the development of democratic forms of government accompanied by the evolution of a pluralist political culture the rule of law and improvements in material conditions especially through job creation if there is progress in these areas democracy will follow that is the lesson of chile indonesia the philippines south korea taiwan and several promising young democracies in africa
6482498 putting the world on notice that they are players playing to win and not just olympic gold they want you to know that china is a power to be reckoned with and proud of it and that its bearing down on the united states fast
6482499 the implications are that china will be the commercial leader of the world it will also deserve and demand leadership in global institutions we can model the chinese economy and show that by 2035 it will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy
6482500 so where will that leave the united states are we slipping are we reaching some inevitable tipping point that will change the world as we know it is the golden age of america coming to an end
6482501 whats happening right now is the world is moving beyond america the future is in many ways being shaped in distant places by foreign people
6482502 thats a big shift from a world in which america was at the center economically financially culturally militarily politically to a world in which there are more centers and many forces from india to china to brazil to south africa that have to be taken into account this is not happening because america is failing or declining its happening because the rest are rising and its happening because the natives have gotten good at capitalism at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success why is this happening because countries around the world are doing what weve been telling them to do for the last 60 years open yourself up to capitalism to free trade to technology

6482515 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6482516 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county

6482527 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6482528 the figures suggest a welcome slowing in the downward trend for language take up at gcse what we want to see now is the reversal of that trend
6482529 it is more important than ever for teenagers to recognise the value of linguistic and intercultural skills
6482530 languages compete with a host of other subjects at options time yet language skills are highly valued by employers in the uk and beyond and give young people a real advantage in the jobs market

6482538 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth the drop in food output could begin quite soon perhaps only ten years from now
6482539 to scientists these seemingly disparate incidents represent the advanced signs of fundamental changes in the worlds weather the central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions the earths climate seems to be cooling down
6482540 climatological cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age
6482541 dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth

6482585 this ailing patient the u s cotton sector shows every sign of a great recovery it just may need at least another year to recuperate
6482586 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain before things improve
6482587 acres in the delta region are likely to see a larger decrease approximately 30 percent a change which would see that region losing over half its cotton area in just two years
6482588 despite the relatively low acreage in the long term the u s cotton sector is likely to strengthen largely due to changes in the global sector the u s cotton sector is likely to improve as major global cotton producers such as china and india increasingly divert more acreage into food production to keep pace with rising incomes and populations
6482589 while cotton production in africa continues to have great potential growth is slow and volatility is ever present
6482590 additionally with low yields compared to world averages the region may benefit from increased international focus in terms of multilateral agronomic development and an increased focus from the private sector outside the region that is seeking to develop new resources
6482591 the main reason for the success of indias cotton program has been the implementation of a government program that targeted improvements in seeds extension services marketing infrastructure and processing facilities
6482592 assuming that current trends in terms of strong demand and upward price pressure for grains and oilseeds continues into 2009 it would be reasonable to predict that 2009 2010 u s cotton acreage is unlikely to see a major increase if any increase at all
6482593 however as the economic slowdown eases textile demand is likely to strengthen again and with it demand for cotton
6482594 so as global cotton prices react to any future cut in supply u s cotton growers will be ideally placed to benefit

6482600 can you believe it it looks like hes faster than those nfl guys
6482601 ive made great progress since my rookie year in terms of understanding the game more and more and now i think im at the point im very comfortable saying that i can start in this league
6482602 this probably wouldnt be the best place to play but im also very comfortable here because im learning from one of the best in the game i love it here i have no idea whats out there for me
6482603 you probably didnt write it down and you think its biased
6482604 but ive seen a lot of football and there is no doubt in my mind that he can be that kind of guy for a long time you may think this is an exaggeration but i see a right handed steve young intelligence toughness mobility and athleticism
6482605 from his first day as a freshman to the day he graduated he never lost a competitive sprint ever
6482606 and hes a 4 7 guy look its not the sec but weve got guys that can run weve got cornerbacks running a lot faster than that and a guy like clifton dawson the ivys all time rusher but he just never let anybody beat him
6482607 having three brothers we were always banging on each other doing sports we were iron kids we did all kinds of triathlons and we played every sport it seems soccer swimming you name it swimming was neat because its something you were able to do by yourself
6482608 i think he can throw it all over the field
6482609 he can throw every ball and hes accurate hes got a lot of zip good touch
6482610 a lot of guys that they say have a great arm
6482611 hes made good decisions running with the ball there on the third down play for 21 yards was a huge play
6482612 jeff rowe had that same instance happen on second and 2 and tried to throw the ball to the flat and now were trying to convert a third down rather than running it take your lumps and get the first down and lets come back and play i see ryan make quick decisions like that
6482613 carsons scruffiness rubs off on everybody its more of his laziness than anything
6482614 hes one of the most down to earth guys ive met in this league considering how high his station is
6482615 and he could be such a bad guy if he wanted to be
6482616 theres a good amount of trust between us now in terms of stuff im seeing on the field with different plays and different coverages different blitzes
6482617 ive got to be his eyes on the sideline its one thing to hear it from a coach but to hear it from a player who knows what hes going through its important for him to have those different set of eyes
6482618 hes been a star his whole life ive been in the shadows
6482619 two thirds of me is thinking that this is great what a find i cant believe that arizona or arizona state isnt all over this kid

6482643 this feels more like a blog post rosie a good blog but a lame article
6482644 a growing challenge for corporations engaging with their customers through social technologies is how to address the flow of blog comments without the ability to track users
6482645 with this release of lithium blogs enterprises can more easily embrace blogs both by helping to understand who their blog participants are and by providing a scalable workflow for managing the conversations
6482646 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6482647 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
6482648 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6482649 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6482650 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6482651 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6482652 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6482653 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6482654 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6482655 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6482656 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6482657 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6482658 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6482659 there is no difference between a god who will not act because of his nature and one who cannot act because he doesnt exist
6482660 everyone has questions but we dont have the answers yet
6482661 of course many things have changed at the restaurant but to me the biggest change has been the food culture in britain
6482662 back in the day you could count the number of great restaurants on one hand and the british public wasnt as sophisticated as it is today people didnt want to eat their steak rare and we had to fight to get our diners to embrace the french culinary culture
6482663 but things really have moved on and today britain has a fantastic culinary offering that is appreciated by the public
6482664 one highlight was moving le gavroche from lower sloane street in knightsbridge to upper brook street in mayfair in 1981
6482665 we closed up on saturday night at the old location and opened up on monday morning at the new restaurant serving drinks and canap s to 400 people that night we didnt lose a single day of trading
6482666 there were so many people on the streets watching a fireworks display in hyde park that our diners literally couldnt make their way to the restaurant
6482667 it was disappointing of course but we took it in our stride and continued to run the restaurant as we did before
6482668 there have been three starred restaurants in london such as chez nico and marco pierre white at the hyde park hotel that lost their stars and you never heard from them again le gavroches consistency over the past 41 years is second to none
6482669 the most important thing is that you please your customers which we did and they continued to come to le gavroche even after we lost the third star
6482670 who is michelin they dont pay the bills the customers do
6482671 when he got them he took the meat out of the shells and proceeded to eat them the shells that is
6482672 everyone in the restaurant was staring at him in disbelief
6482673 hed arrive at 12 30pm eat lunch and leave again at 1 15pm
6482674 when he got older in his 80s he started to suffer from alzheimers and on more than one occasion he came in for lunch at the usual time and then returned at 2pm because hed forgotten that hed already been in for lunch so we called his secretary put him in a taxi and sent him back home
6482675 when i first started at le gavroche there were no british waiters and 37 years on there still arent any
6482676 its usually people from the commonwealth or the continent who hold front of house jobs because british people seem to frown upon service unlike the continent in this country being a waiter isnt considered a real profession and its a real problem for the industry
6482677 i wont just sit around and do nothing after ive retired thats not the kind of person i am
6482678 i do plan on spending more time shooting which is my favourite pastime and i love being outdoors but ill still play a role at le gavroche as restaurant director alongside michel and albert roux and i will continue to be involved in the staff training
6482679 and if anyone in the industry needs my advice on staff training ill be more than happy to help out
6482680 my time at le gavroche has been fantastic and i couldnt have managed a better restaurant
6482681 i wouldnt have taken my pension if i wasnt 100 sure that i was leaving the restaurant in capable hands
6482682 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6482683 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6482684 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6482685 schaeffler would benefit from continental but continental not from schaeffler
6482686 by leveraging the multicore technology in labview and the latest ni multicore pxi embedded controller we were able to increase our test throughput by one additional workday per week

6482703 this is the first volunteer bash that i can remember where we had the opportunity to watch balloons go up
6482704 theres nothing prettier than looking up in the sky and seeing all the balloons this weekend
6482705 but theres nothing better than looking out and seeing all of these volunteers who work very very hard to make it happen
6482706 the first time it was downtown right on the courthouse
6482707 when we were patrons we couldnt decide which way to go
6482708 we wanted to be able to see the balloons and be right where the action is
6482709 a guy started to go up in a balloon and realized he didnt leave the keys with his wife
6482710 when he came back down he caught a power line and the balloon caught on fire
6482711 we dont like to think about the bad stuff but these guys do
6482712 we had a circus and had to evacuate everyone out of the tent

6482715 while the has been some debate concerning the intensity of the investigation especially in the context of an academic environment the board had an overall responsibility to find the truth to the extent possible and believes it appropriately fulfilled that obligation

6482725 while cyber shopping visits rose most quickly in germany during the first week of the holiday shopping season online shoppers in france have since become more active
6482726 these gains show that consumers armed with high speed access and positive online retail experiences are increasingly comfortable shopping online
6482727 as online spending continues to grow and account for a larger percentage of total consumer spending the growth in online shopping could be the difference between a good christmas and a great christmas for many online retailers

6482737 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6482738 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6482739 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis

6482754 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable

6482769 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6482770 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6482771 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6482772 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6482773 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6482774 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6482775 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6482776 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6482777 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6482778 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6482779 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions

6482827 give me more than half of your gt gt gt honestly earned money or you will be arrested
6482828 opening a west coast office is a natural next step for edgeview
6482829 over the last year weve put a lot of time and effort into increasing our presence with west coast financial sponsors and middle market companies and it only makes sense to have dedicated resources located in the region
6482830 foi um momento de grande alegria para o pa s
6482831 i spend my days out on the training field with the players
6482832 i dont know the latest news on these things that youre asking me about
6482833 while hes still here hes still very much a tottenham player thats how we consider things at the moment
6482834 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6482835 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6482836 its no secret hes somebody that weve identified but theres still a bit of work to be done and we await the outcome
6482837 hes a player weve watched for a while and hes got the technical ability and quality to help our squad
6482838 hes not the final piece by a fair way every manager wants another couple of players here or there
6482839 the chairman is aware of which players we want and conversations have been had with certain clubs about certain players
6482840 we hope that things drop in over the next 10 days if not well be as competitive as we can with the players weve got
6482841 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6482842 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
6482843 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6482844 if somebody had a crystal ball and said were not going to get any injuries or suspensions before january were fine
6482845 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6482846 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6482847 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6482848 china es un gran pa s con mil 300 millones de personas es f cil encontrar muchos talentos por lo tanto aunque por supuesto 40 medallas me sorprenden en proporci n a la poblaci n es bastante normal

6482853 it doesnt matter if they were or werent involved in an attack today yesterday or on sept 11 2001 we seek out terrorists and we will give them the option to be captured or killed or possibly flee
6482854 we have no information allowing us to consider that french soldiers were killed under fire of nato planes
6482855 i said before the start of the season that the first four games were ones we were looking at taking points from and nothing is different
6482856 we turned kilmarnock over in the cup last season im sure jim jefferies will have that fresh in their minds and well need to be at our best if we can win then it has been more than a decent start to the season
6482857 their motivation will be to keep our unbeaten run going hopefully that will be enough
6482858 well take it a game at a time but if we could take nine points from nine it would be some achievement
6482859 winning games on the road in the spl is a lot harder than winning games in the first division and although we just did that at inverness its no easy task
6482860 i dont have a problem with us being top of the league and people getting carried away with that at the end of the day you want your team to win
6482861 we carried that mantel last season we know what were trying to do at the club and weve got belief in that
6482862 ah pas algo m s que el simple problema t cnico
6482863 gt the computer screen that controls the intouch health robot shows people at the newark wayne hospital
6482864 wherever there is a wireless network you can move that robot
6482865 you can do an exam and pretty much everything you want through this robot
6482866 this is a case that illustrates everything that is wrong with the death penalty in texas
6482867 the governor cant grant clemency without a recommendation for it weve seen cases get stayed literally at the eleventh hour so its not over
6482868 does not himself kill attempt to kill or intend that a killing take place or lethal force will be employed
6482869 thats why i think this issue may come back to the supreme court
6482870 because we made a decision that this wasnt the same kind of thing
6482871 and you have a situation that the rest of the world views with shock and incomprehension
6482872 its a pretty traditional criminal law that accomplices and co conspirators are equally held culpable
6482873 you dont have to specifically agree to commit a killing you agree to commit the target crime then any other crimes that are foreseeable youre responsible
6482874 flies in the face of a broader effort to reserve the death penalty for extreme cases
6482875 they argued clearly and unambiguously that reneau was the bad actor
6482876 then after getting the death sentence at woods trial they essentially conflated the two men they argued that they were in this together
6482877 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6482878 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6482879 it has very little to do with logic and certainly nothing to do with compassion
6482880 just about the time i think its almost out my mind i read another article about it in the newspaper
6482881 kriss was lying behind the counter and i had to step over him
6482882 i had to check the register tape to see the what time the last transaction was and had to look around to determine what was missing
6482883 weve already had one death i dont know if another death solves the problem
6482884 i have mixed emotions about the death penalty its a hard one
6482885 stay out of the way of the workers so they can finish our school
6482886 so check it out right ive tried every approach to living ive tried it all i havent tried every thing but ive tried every approach sometimes you have to try every
6482887 i thought i would shut myself off i thought maybe thats cool maybe thats what you have to do to become a genius is you have to be mad so if you can get mad before the word genius then maybe you can make genius appear right that doesnt work either
6482888 and im in a good place ive paced myself pretty well im 30 ive seen some cool stuff i made a lot of stuff happen for myself
6482889 thats just love ive done everything in my life that ive wanted to do except just give and feel love for my living and i dont mean like a roman candle fireworks hollywood hot pink love i mean like ive got your
6482890 i dont need to hear i love ya you guys love me i love you we got that down but some of the people who would tell you they love you will be the last people to just have your back so im gonna experiment with this love thing giving love feeling love i know its corny but its the last thing ive got to check out before i check out
6482891 stealing money that was meant for special needs children to fund an excessive luxury life style is one of the most egregious type of fraud schemes
6482892 shriners is a great organization that brodzin took advantage of using his position of trust as cfo
6482893 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6482894 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6482895 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6482896 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6482897 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6482898 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6482899 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6482900 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6482901 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6482902 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6482903 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6482904 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6482905 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6482906 i know thats what he said but i dont think thats what he meant
6482907 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg initially its shocking and you think whoa i have to actually think about what i eat and work out double the amount i did before
6482908 we need a social licence the ok from the community to operate
6482909 more often than not the veterans i have spoken to all say they know somebody who has attempted suicide
6482910 based on what were seeing already this country hasnt seen anything yet in terms of the severity of combat trauma and veteran suicide rates
6482911 its about what happens there and how long they spend there
6482912 i hear over and over again if i have a 19 year old sitting in my office or a 60 year old from vietnam the exact same things are coming out of their mouths
6482913 the first time was when she called from iraq weeping and weeping and saying oh mom i can never come home i just killed a 12 year old boy i knew from that point on she was suicidal
6482914 an army guy comes back to the base and there is a whole social structure on the base
6482915 the guard guy comes back to canby and 48 hours after hes come back hes walking on the street in canby with his buddies
6482916 theres something in your brain thats going to be changed after picking up bits and pieces of your best friend
6482917 i can laugh and dance a jig around the thousands of body parts of the insurgents ive seen ive also seen kids killed and thats the part that hurts
6482918 a lot of these people are not being recognized as casualties of the war theyre given this label of disgrace and its a shame
6482919 findings on tv news and online only news produced a few surprises but on the newspaper front the indications were mainly negative
6482920 this year for the first time in roughly 15 years of asking the question fewer than half of all americans report reading a daily newspaper on a regular basis
6482921 the falloff in readership over the past two years has occurred across the board men and women whites and blacks college graduates and those who never attended college are all reading the newspaper at lower rates than in 2006 age continues to be strongly correlated with newspaper readership currently only 15 percent of those younger than 25 report having read a newspaper yesterday among those ages 25 to 34 24 percent read a newspaper yesterday this compares with roughly half 46 percent of those 50 and older
6482922 the audience for online newspapers has grown modestly since 2006
6482923 still online newspapers are gaining readers especially among people ages 25 to 34 among people in this age group who read a newspaper yesterday fully 16 percent report having read the paper online slightly fewer 12 percent say they read the paper version
6482924 the proportion of this age group reporting it read an online newspaper yesterday has doubled from 9 percent in 2006 to 19 percent in 2008
6482925 even so total newspaper readership among those ages 25 to 34 has not increased over the past two years
6482926 biggest online dance battles in the history of man kind
6482927 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

6482930 party conventions are a free for all for influence peddling
6482931 for example even though the rules ban lawmakers from attending a party hosted by a lobbying organization that honors a specific member at amp t appears willing to host parties that honor congressional caucuses such as the
6482932 the preaching of today is apt to emphasize strength of will beauty of character the things that are easily noticed the phrase we hear so often decide for christ is an emphasis on something our lord never trusted he never asks us to decide for him but to yield to him

6482934 llev a un ni o al cami n y pensaba que estaba en una pel cula
6482935 tenemos que monitorear de cerca los antecedentes pero no vemos raz n para tomar semejantes medidas
6482936 to find the balance you want this is what you must become
6482937 its really great because as a kid i was a huge superman fan and i watched all the movies with my parents
6482938 im a big pop culture mythology guy so stories like the superman mythology and the star wars mythology theyre significant and theyre important because i think theyre great tools for teaching basic moralities especially to kids so thats why i am so into them thats why i feel very lucky to be a part of it
6482939 you know who doesnt want to take a swing at that guy
6482940 i just hope the fans like what we do with it because its our own interpretation its with the blessing of dc comics and we are not invalidating any back story doomsdays had previously but we are interpreting and adding to that back story and hopefully the fans dig on it
6482941 i was told that early on i think battlestar galactica co star katee sackhoff suggested that to me because she went though hell with that stuff about playing starbuck i try to stay away from it and just kind of do what i think i should do and hope they like it and eventually it will trickle back whether people like it or not id rather have that happen in sort of a more natural process then going to seek it out
6482942 i dont stay up late at night googling myself too often
6482943 i will say that i do like to hear fans reactions because i dont take things very personally and i know that a lot of the time i am just more impressed and excited that people care so much even if its negative
6482944 i really want to know who clark is and whats going on with him
6482945 i am very inquisitive about clark because he was close to lex and lex is missing thats pretty much the only thing i want to find out right now is where he is and i think that clark can help me do that so im trying to find out ways that i can convince clark to help me out
6482946 the stories about him are incredible everybody loves him and watching him hes so talented id absolutely love to work with michael rosenbaum
6482947 what i can tell you is that we know each other
6482948 and im still finding out how we know each other but we do
6482949 the pilot i shot with justin was so much fun
6482950 we got to play paramedics so there was a lot of needles involved and there was a lot of tubing it was really cool then to have the opportunity to work with him again because its a familiar face coming into a group of people you dont know its nice to have one person that you do know
6482951 whats cool is that there are members of the crew that were on battlestar galactica
6482952 so getting there were some friendly faces that was really awesome
6482953 and i cant say anything about that but its a very cool thing where that relationship is going its a new type of thing for the show ill say this i dont think clark has had the opportunity to have a friend like davis and likewise i cant get any more vague then that can i theyre going to have a very unique buddy buddy friendship and that sounds weird too doesnt it i just cant talk about it i really cant its an awesome idea though its a really awesome idea
6482954 he grew up in the foster system he was bounced from home to home and had a very tough childhood he is brought into the story as he forms this fast friendship with chloe and eventually he starts sort of blacking out missing time and he becomes curious as to why that is happening what he learns is really horrible stuff he finds out that he is innately the opposite of what he wanted to be hopefully the telling of that story will be very sad and psychologically messed up and it will probably very easily be the darkest stuff smallville has ever done
6482955 then eventually he is doomsday and he will eventually resemble the character dc comics fans are expecting
6482956 playing those roles its really tiring but its a great challenge
6482957 i like doing things that intimidate me you know when i read the script for the mist
6482958 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6482959 this is the lowest percentage of imported measles cases since 1996
6482960 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis

6482967 so team manager kartar singh had to do the job we did not have any idea about the doctors either who had been attached with the contingent
6482968 going into my fourth bout of the day i was really tired and there was hardly any time to relax in between i badly needed the rubbing and massaging
6482969 trust me gold medal is not an absurd dream we have a talent pool deep enough and all you need is infrastructure
6482970 i just gorged on food before a bout we generally go on a fast to ensure we are not overweight even if you drink a glass of water it becomes a reason for panic
6482971 once my bout was over i had enough food im a vegetarian and i ate mostly fruits
6482972 im not sure about the promised awards once i reach home i would have a better idea
6482973 no gloves tevebaugh acquired a fingerful of fire ant stings one corner of the bed remains unweeded until i figure out how to flush their nest or work around it potentially ruined a pair of garage sale pants and contracted bathtub crinkly finger syndrome it never really stopped drizzling the entire time
6482974 it wasnt something that we staged we didnt say usain take the shoes and show them
6482975 he did it because he really identifies with puma he really values what we did for him to make him the hero of our olympic games campaign not knowing what he could accomplish here
6482976 we are opponents on the mat but we are all friends off it
6482977 this is a very popular sport in russia as well as in the other parts of the caucasus
6482978 you can almost call this the national sport the olympic competition is a four year cycle and they always bring surprises they are always unpredictable
6482979 i guess experience was also a factor today this is a very tough competition but the rules are the same for everyone
6482980 im from ireland and i dont know how to play poker
6482981 oh my god thats michael the irish guy we were just looking at
6482982 maybe you could start singing michael row the boat ashore or something

6482985 gvg effectively produces weight loss in both adolescent and adult animals
6482986 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6482987 having a home a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
6482988 les v nements prennent la couleur des yeux avec lesquels nous les regardons

6482993 we deeply regret this incident and apologize for the concern and inconvenience it has caused
6482994 we are committed to helping those who were affected and strongly encourage them to sign up for the complimentary credit monitoring and to take the action steps outlined in our letter
6482995 is the law then against the promises of god certainly not for if there had been a law given which could have given life truly righteousness would have been by the law
6482996 but the scripture has confined all under sin that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe
6482997 we definitely needed a change at halftime and we tried to get things going with fatmire bajramaj and conny pohlers and they gave us more attack in the second half
6482998 i am happy with getting the medal as in the first half we did not have the forward play as we did throughout the tournament our forward play was not good enough we didnt pass as well as usually do but our defence was okay
6482999 all the players did their best they did everything they had been working towards and we lost but we will learn from our defeat
6483000 its not good for us but this is what happens in football one team loses and one team wins against argentina its always very difficult with a great rivalry
6483001 brazil has to work hard to form a team because nothing will happen with just big names with 11 big names a team has to be prepared if the players dont know that it will be difficult to form a team

6483007 i know there were a lot of ioc members here this week i know back softball is working their butts off to get the word out and make the rounds there are a lot of women here not just usa players that want to see this sport back in the games i mean this team japan played their tails off and they want to be here in 2016 just as much as we do
6483008 if we had the olympics tomorrow it makes it hard to lose
6483009 you dont want to lose on your gold medal game
6483010 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief

6483020 it will definitely change the weekend for me because its a tragedy
6483021 all the spanish people are in shock and i am too
6483022 its probably the saddest approach to a weekend i have had
6483023 i will wear a black armband and i will talk with the other drivers tomorrow
6483024 maybe we can do something before starting maybe one minutes silence in the pit lane
6483025 tomorrow we will start slowly to get into the weekend life continues but its a different weekend compared to what it should be

6483047 i dont see anything rosy about whats going on in the job market the level of unemployment claims are in recession territory
6483048 the economy should improve next year though the housing market will start heading up in the second half of the year and the consumer will come back especially if we continue to get a break on inflation with oil prices coming down
6483049 job losses tend to be persistent and the economy does turn before the job market
6483050 the financial sector has to straighten itself out for our forecast to be feasible
6483051 i think the employees at that particular location should be congratulated
6483052 i think no doubt whats happening at gatineau will be encouraging
6483053 our priority is to continue to run an efficient operation to ensure that we can fulfill our commitment to provide customers the everyday low prices they expect from wal mart
6483054 u s workers continue to wait to get the same respect from wal mart
6483055 if higher wages better benefits and fair treatment are incompatible with way of doing business its time for the company to change which is what wal mart watch has been saying all along
6483056 beyond deaths and injuries the ilos role in promoting safe and healthy jobs
6483057 if we are going to have a serious discussion about health care reform in this country we need to include mental health in that
6483058 its something that rarely gets talked about and is almost never discussed in the african american community
6483059 the sticker price is truly the tip of the iceberg
6483060 are you kidding lots of women would rather see him dead than have another woman win lets get real at that point it isnt even about the guy but the other woman shes competition
6483061 i just wanted to tell you that i just got back from my vacation and i appreciate the service your company provided
6483062 twice now and i am a very satisfied customer and will use you again in the future thanks again
6483063 the targets the government has set for schools and the league tables distort the tests educational purpose and encourage schools to play the system
6483064 some of these schools are doing a good job but have high student throughput
6483065 the government could have quietly sent the school inspectorate in to check what is going on
6483066 he would engage in a long unfocused monologue and go off on tangents with no apparent link to the discussion at hand
6483067 despite having lived in britain for two years did not often display an informed exposure to the outside world
6483068 in the sunni stream of islam the door to interpretation and reasoning ijtihad had been closed since at least the 13th century
6483069 you can do something now save 15 of us emissions just by the way you drive
6483070 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6483071 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6483072 sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do
6483073 parents interest in childrens learning is associated with what their children actually learn and this does not have to be in a high pressure way but as a natural part of daily life at home
6483074 if the child expresses anxiety theyll need extra help transitioning to kindergarten but ive never actually encountered this in kids who come from daycare theyre used to a group setting theyre already with some friends and it all seems to generally go very smoothly
6483075 its always good to talk about change before it happens even if the change in our adult view doesnt seem significant children whove attended childcare may have questions about how kindergarten will be the same or different parents and children should talk together about these things
6483076 children who have attended preschool will be familiar with group activities such as story time group singing playtime at activity centres and perhaps snack time
6483077 but there will be differences too such as attending a big school with other grade levels and perhaps taking the bus or walking instead of being driven by car
6483078 the number one issue that ive encountered with kids whove never been in daycare or preschool is anxiety
6483079 the other issue that keeps coming up is toilet training
6483080 talk about it every day in natural conversation and in a relaxed and happy way
6483081 its key for parents is not to convey their own feelings of anxiety of letting go children take their social cues from their parents and family members so its important to stay positive and relaxed

6483083 alexs hometown of bridgend hit the press recently after a shocking spate of youth suicides
6483084 shes hoping that success today might provide some welcome good news for a town thats been living under a cloud
6483085 because of all the bad press that bridgend has been getting lately i just think that getting through would be the good bit of news that we need
6483086 they thought that up when i said i was from bridgend the producers wanted me to talk about it but i didnt want to just in case i offended someones family i would much rather be known for the talent than the girl that comes from the suicide town

6483093 my speculation is sen mccain will choose mitt romney based on romneys broad appeal to a broad conservative base romney is who he will choose
6483094 no one had ever seen a case where a client picks up that many cases
6483095 i dont know if i did or didnt but i wasnt in the right state of mind im a very sick person
6483096 weve presented that case to the grand jury and i think theres a better than 50 50 chance that theyll be indicted
6483097 people who are mentally ill when they are separated they tend to deteriorate more which means a longer stay in jail
6483098 inmates wont take a head dive which some have tried
6483099 were still going in but its amazing all the changes that have occurred in the last year and a half
6483100 he always said for 37 you made me come back
6483101 we had rolled back down to galveston and my problem is i want to be accepted
6483102 i had come to terms that i dont have any friends unless i have something
6483103 they drilled me so much that when i felt like i was going to have an episode i should go to the hospital so thats what i did
6483104 when i get off my medication i go through these hills everyone is after alexander and im very very careless with myself im just really off the chain once i get my medicine i stabilize and i can take care of myself
6483105 they said i was going to harm somebody that i was talking about i was going to kill all the babies
6483106 something about the babies the little babies so they arrested me
6483107 i was a great asset as well as it was a great asset to me i knew that i was somebody and very important they just give you so much good affirmation
6483108 alexander has been a real problem since he hit the door here
6483109 we really dont want alexander to stay in here any longer than is absolutely necessary wed like to send him on to the state he is a chronically labor intensive pain in the ass
6483110 didnt hold a grudge against you tomorrow for something you did yesterday
6483111 when i first saw him i stood way away from the door and he couldnt understand why i told him mr hatcher youre not really a nice person he did hit those people he did all those things
6483112 now some of the assaults were provoked because its like they dont understand or they dont care that these people are mentally ill
6483113 i wish they could get their mental health care somewhere else but thats not my call
6483114 they get caught doing some petty ass crime they get stuck in jail and this is where they get their treatment they get pretty leveled out and what do we do with them i cant hold them after their charge runs out so we dump them back on the street
6483115 i have high blood pressure that doesnt excuse me from knocking the crap out of you i got to keep that under control
6483116 were not saying none of this ever happens that would be naive but a lot of this is blown out of proportion
6483117 these complaints become more and more outlandish weve had people say i was hurt and i say howd you get hurt whered you get hurt you dont have any signs of it theyll go oh well fuck you and well never see them again
6483118 he beat me in facial parts kick and used unprofessional slander towards me
6483119 all they have is intimidation if they dont intimidate someone into complying we are all screwed
6483120 he could have had bruises from being subdued and bruises from the handcuffs
6483121 i can understand the deputies because none of us are safe if they cant get control
6483122 i dont care if the sheriffs department treated him terribly i dont care if they trumped up the charges i dont care if the world fell apart in here between the attorney and the court someone should have made sense of it the court should have done better than that
6483123 there are moments he is totally out of control and thats why to me the insanity defense was accurate even though he might be sane on tuesday he could be insane on wednesday and then go back to being sane on thursday his mental illness was that volatile
6483124 my thought was that i might be able to beat one or two of these charges but i probably wasnt going to beat every single one and it was 25 to life on each one
6483125 we started filling out the plea paperwork but then alexander didnt want it it may sound like i had a lot of influence over him but the reality was that i didnt he was a very difficult person to communicate with
6483126 peraino said that at the time of the series of crimes hatcher was criminally insane
6483127 based upon that i had no choice but to try it id be derelict as a lawyer if i ignored that
6483128 what im opposed to is lawyers using criminal insanity as a throw down when there appears to be no other defense
6483129 have you your spouse or relative ever been under the care of a psychiatrist psychologist or other mental health professional
6483130 hatcher appeared to be in a similar mental state to that upon discharge from rusk state hospital with the exception of being depressed
6483131 he was however likely extremely psychotic at the time of his initial offense and continued to be psychotic during the jail period prior to the rusk placement he was either not medicated or inappropriately medicated during the period prior to placement at rusk in sum it is highly likely that he was insane during the period he incurred the six offenses
6483132 ive never seen those doctors before god knows ive never did
6483133 unless i was in that bad condition that i dont remember
6483134 you look at alexanders record hes had a long history of problems with the law i mean nothing serious in terms of murder assaults or that nature but a lot of sort of stupid stuff and hes had a long history of mental illness
6483135 in my heart i believe that 53 years was not justice
6483136 i hope you havent made any plans for the future
6483137 i said fifty three years people that murder people dont get 53 years he told me i dont know mama well i dont know
6483138 in 53 years ill be gone thats all i pray that god do let me live because he would be lost he dont have nobody but me
6483139 i will enter into divine words seminary in california i made this vow to god i may be the first roman catholic missionary priest in the joseph and hatcher family i feel the happiness will come when working with the 3rd world county in south africa
6483140 alexander is the most religious person i guess i should tell him he needs to start praying different
6483141 he hasnt been a bad bad person but he has done a lot of things hes even done things to me but hes my child and i cant throw him away
6483142 i cannot complain i go through it every once in a while but im just here
6483143 to be honest with you i dont know how all this happened but it had to have been something i did that was against the rules of harris county jail
6483144 i spend my days out on the training field with the players
6483145 i dont know the latest news on these things that youre asking me about
6483146 while hes still here hes still very much a tottenham player thats how we consider things at the moment
6483147 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6483148 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6483149 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6483150 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
6483151 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6483152 if somebody had a crystal ball and said were not going to get any injuries or suspensions before january were fine
6483153 i said before the start of the season that the first four games were ones we were looking at taking points from and nothing is different
6483154 we turned kilmarnock over in the cup last season im sure jim jefferies will have that fresh in their minds and well need to be at our best if we can win then it has been more than a decent start to the season
6483155 their motivation will be to keep our unbeaten run going hopefully that will be enough
6483156 well take it a game at a time but if we could take nine points from nine it would be some achievement
6483157 winning games on the road in the spl is a lot harder than winning games in the first division and although we just did that at inverness its no easy task
6483158 i dont have a problem with us being top of the league and people getting carried away with that at the end of the day you want your team to win
6483159 we carried that mantel last season we know what were trying to do at the club and weve got belief in that
6483160 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6483161 gm faces the biggest challenge weve seen since the start of the industry

6483164 im sure they opt out of singing i kissed a girl or ur so gay said katy but theyre singing along to every other song on the record theyre just glad im not strung out doing centrefolds and s t like that
6483165 i think gay people have a wonderful sense of humour she said i think theyll get it and embrace it its an anthem for power of the people for females gays exes anybody whos been broken up with that wants to get over a guy
6483166 its no secret hes somebody that weve identified but theres still a bit of work to be done and we await the outcome
6483167 hes a player weve watched for a while and hes got the technical ability and quality to help our squad
6483168 hes not the final piece by a fair way every manager wants another couple of players here or there
6483169 the chairman is aware of which players we want and conversations have been had with certain clubs about certain players
6483170 we hope that things drop in over the next 10 days if not well be as competitive as we can with the players weve got
6483171 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6483172 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6483173 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6483174 chief said he should release koroma and his family so that they could go to liberia

6483176 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
6483177 i know self harming is not funny but its just a joke so im not going to beat myself up about it
6483178 im incredibly proud to have won this award ill be flaunting it about all over the place and i think i will be wearing it as a hat just to let everybody know ive won
6483179 im doubly pleased to win this award as its very rare for me to write one liners and when you write a good joke you instantly know because something twitches in your tummy and you just know its going to work
6483180 its been a great festival this year and i always love coming up to scotland to perform especially if i keep picking up awards like this one

6483186 the decision is in and sco has gone down in defeat the u s district court in utah has ruled in favor of novell in sco vs microsoft novell monopoly 2 0
6483187 remember when jason matasow asked how can microsoft not be evil the question remains unanswered
6483188 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux the dell ubuntu powered mini notebook is on its way
6483189 theres nothing to do in lively if youre not talking to someone
6483190 the combination of x rite amazys and pantone represents a clear leadership the business of color

6483193 deal pipeline takes up to a year to dry out
6483194 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6483195 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6483196 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6483197 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6483198 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6483199 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6483200 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6483201 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6483202 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6483203 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6483204 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux microsoft invests 100 million more in novell
6483205 however novell has only invoiced 156 million of microsofts original 240 million certificate purchase leaving 35 of the funds where novell can beat microsoft
6483206 the var guy admits it he left novell for dead last year but recent conversations with the company forced him to rethink all of those microsofts new weapon against open source stupidity
6483207 an information week article published last week appears to position microsoft as trying to do something right when it comes
6483208 we need to be realistic about what we can and cant do with hydrogen right now

6483213 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6483214 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6483215 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6483216 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6483217 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6483218 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play

6483240 i have no clue about his future as i didnt ask him about his plans
6483241 what i know is that hes happy playing for real madrid the best team in the world and everything he does is very well
6483242 i have no idea whether he is going to hang up his boots there or not

6483248 debe ense arles que aunque esa persona no est sigue viva en el recuerdo y sigue teniendo los mismos sentimientos positivos hacia ellos
6483249 cuando una persona ha vivido una situaci n traum tica es frecuente que tenga pesadillas o incluso estando despierto tenga im genes que le provocan ansiedad pero tiene que comprender sin asustarse que todo eso que le sucede es normal

6483254 hes one of these players where the game stops around him and he sorts it out
6483255 i liken him to a chess player rather than checkers because a chess player has to think three or four moves in front
6483256 he thinks about these three or four moves while hes in action that to me makes a very very talented player
6483257 i was on the right path to play us college basketball and try out for the nba but i lost the passion for it
6483258 at the junior olympics i wasnt as motivated as i should have been when i played i was pumped up but off the court i didnt enjoy it
6483259 i was impressed enough to think he was a good footballer but you dont see most of the other teams so you dont know how he compares
6483260 your recruiting staff has carte blanche he reminded me of a combination of league players im not going to say who but there was just enough about him
6483261 hes quite unique because hes got such a massive basketball background but hes also very tough hes a real hard at the ball player in close
6483262 you combine that with his football ability and his basketball ability and hes got great nous
6483263 that was going to be the case but because hes such a dedicated man and has such great ball sense there wasnt a lot to it
6483264 i had to get used to words like sweepers and go to and hit zones
6483265 his approach to gippy power wasnt a reflection of big headedness it was a belief that he could get to that level
6483266 the way he plays theres no fancy dance about him you dont come away seeing him take the mark of the year or kick the goal of the year or bouncing his way from full back to full forward
6483267 ive played in three finals and every one of them was amazing
6483268 its just the nature of the beast with our job that youll have ups and downs
6483269 my ups at the roosters certainly outweighed the downs but ive moved on now
6483270 not really i think people know i speak from the heart and honestly if i had a gripe id certainly air it
6483271 im fortunate for the opportunity the roosters gave me as an inexperienced young coach
6483272 but i feel i did my job there and now im doing my job at the sharks
6483273 its an important game for us to get some form back on the board because i dont feel weve been playing very well over the past two weeks
6483274 youre not going to be up for every game of football but its time now to get back up and stay there were in a little bit of a rut in terms of the quality of the football were playing but in the rut weve still won one out of two
6483275 what i can tell you is weve got a team of people here that are working hard weekly the positive ive got in this club is that ive got a team
6483276 you dont necessarily need a team of superstars to have a team
6483277 its still too early to tell if weve been successful this season but i just feel as though weve got more in us
6483278 weve set ourselves a nice platform whether we can now bounce off that and set ourselves up well see
6483279 theres been more talk about it by others than worry by brett or i
6483280 its the order we are looking to use this week we will be looking to matty to put the afterburners on and we will respond to what we see
6483281 its a matter of how far he goes al has performed really well for us and we know he is capable of going the distance
6483282 matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt so that serves us well this week
6483283 its going to be dry its going to be fast so that order serves us well
6483284 he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6483285 its good to have him back but most importantly its good forhim
6483286 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6483287 he is a point of difference we have versatility in the mix
6483288 and in terms of covering fullback ryan will do that
6483289 in total 17 million australians have watched the beijing games on television
6483290 across prime time the beijing games were up 13 per cent on athens and are delivering the equivalent of two afl or nrl grand finals a night every night
6483291 overall across the entire broadcast the games are up 31 per cent on athens
6483292 in china alone a staggering 842 million watched some coverage of the olympic opening ceremony and more than a billion people have watched some olympic sports coverage
6483293 beijing 2008 marks the first time that digital media coverage live broadband coverage including online high definition for the first time and mobile phone clips have been freely available across the world
6483294 in contrast four years ago in athens only eight territories experimented with some delayed internet coverage
6483295 in the us nbcs olympics com is receiving 30 times more video views than it did in athens and 12 times more mobile phone clip downloads than it did for the winter games in turin in 2006
6483296 in china over the first 12 days of competition 102 million people watched the live broadcast of the games online with another 146 million people watching delayed coverage video on demand this story is being repeated across the globe
6483297 online interest is also reflecting record website traffic on both the ioc and bocog beijing olympic organisers websites
6483298 i was in a bit of shock and i didnt want to get my hopes up so i just had to double check
6483299 i didnt want to feel like i felt in athens when we lost that bronze medal game to the us
6483300 i dont think i have loved my sister so much in all my life
6483301 i just wanted to grab her and give her a hug
6483302 i have a lot of faith in this team theyre gutsy
6483303 we both went through a lot of emotions it was a great game
6483304 i dont believe that it should be up for players to miss for teams to win but well take the win thats for sure
6483305 we came here with high aspirations and its just fantastic to walk away with a bronze medal
6483306 it only happens every four years and not many people get to compete at an olympic games let alone get a medal
6483307 we could see all the breeze was over there but we made up ground and kept hanging in
6483308 we had to do a big catch up from there
6483309 basically it was like driving a car with a flat tyre
6483310 we could still sail the boat as hard as we could but because the mast was able to rotate freely our speed through the water was affected as was the handling of the boat
6483311 were hearing that the international olympic committee is having talks with the international sailing federation and maybe the multihulls will get back in
6483312 often the things that smell the worst do in fact taste the best
6483313 need for speed undercover puts you at the center of a big budget hollywood movie with all of the drama action and dazzling chase scenes right on your gaming console the unique heroic driving engine will give you ultimate control over the hottest cars and push you to use every ounce of skill to outrun the law and take down criminal adversaries
6483314 vi er socialister vi er modstandere af nutidens konomiske system med udnyttelse af den konomisk svage med dens uretf rdige l nninger med dens upassende vurderinger af et menneske i henhold til rigdom og ejendom i stedet for ansvarsbevisthed og opf rsel og vi er alle fast besluttet p at tilintetg re dette system demokratisk
6483315 we are not interested in playing favourites with the two networks nor do we care about ratings but we think our medallists deserve their moment in the sun so we have supported both the nine show and the two forums which seven are putting together
6483316 we wont be drawn on speculation on which network if any has signed an athlete or athletes
6483317 i hope the fans have heard our national anthem so often that when they leave the stadium they will be humming it
6483318 if ryan trades dawson for any combination of players or draft picks he is out of his mind
6483319 he is still alive he hasnt thrown himself off a building yet but he is hurting
6483320 we did everything we could we prepared thoroughly but my best ideas and his best training didnt get us in the final this time
6483321 people say why didnt he just run faster well he didnt because he hasnt needed to before he has beaten those guys in the last 600 metres before
6483322 he expected he would be able to do it again but they were better than they have been before it wasnt his fastest i dont know totally why it was a bit to do with tension and when it is hot it is harder
6483323 he just didnt sprint as well as he normally does no one saw it coming because he was running comfortably and i thought he could match them at the end
6483324 if he is mentally psychologically capable we have to try to get out a performance to show ourselves he has the fitness that he has worked for
6483325 i didnt come here to come 20th it was a really hard race i havent had a lot of speed in my legs lately but i gave it my best shot and just died in the butt
6483326 it was a pretty horrible experience out there it was not good enough and that is the frustrating thing when you have been up there with those girls and i wasnt today it is tough to deal with
6483327 in afghanistan its time to move from a combat oriented approach to one that focuses on negotiation peacemaking and nation building its time to move nato troops out and un peacekeepers in
6483328 my fellow americans im pleased to tell you today that ive signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever we begin bombing in five minutes

6483330 the problem is if they might not have that money to go to court and take on the riaa
6483331 severn i lift me up for i am dying i shall die easy dont be frightened thank god it has come
6483332 i think i shall be among the english poets after my death

6483334 the enemy at last was plain in view it was the modern age in arms
6483335 their seemingly opposite lives were dedicated to the same cause fighting against the future
6483336 im barack obama and i approve this message and i wouldnt approve of bushs choices
6483337 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
6483338 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6483339 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
6483340 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
6483341 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
6483342 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6483343 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
6483344 nosotros somos personas independientes con una postura de centro criticamos los dogmas ideol gicos pensamos en que la libertad de conciencia debe ser la que guie la raz n y el di logo pol tico
6483345 parece que la cpi usa al continente como un caso para realizar pruebas para determinar en qu manera el derecho internacional puede obtener m s legitimidad en el terreno
6483346 la cpi se concentra en la debilidad econ mica y pol tica de pa ses vulnerables y en naciones que no son capaces o no est n dispuestas a juzgar a perpetradores de cr menes contra la humanidad muchos pa ses africanos entran en este criterio
6483347 tenemos que preguntarnos si el castigo es un disuasivo suficiente para aquellos que violan los derechos humanos la intervenci n de la cpi es suficiente para detener cr menes contra la humanidad y cr menes de guerra en frica o en cualquier parte del mundo
6483348 el tribunal tendr a que hacer responsables a todos los tiranos pero esto no ocurre hasta ahora la mayor a de los acusados son africanos los poderosos como por ejemplo estados unidos nunca ser n llevados a juicio
6483349 rusia probablemente no ser juzgada por lo que est pasando en georgia y lo mismo pasa con china
6483350 debemos presentar un juicio contra el presidente zimbabwense robert mugabe a pesar de que esto podr a deteriorar aun m s la situaci n en zimbabwe o debemos darle la posibilidad de salir del gobierno lo cual contribuir a a una situaci n m s estable
6483351 no estoy muy en contra de esto ltimo pues traer a paz y estabilidad a zimbabwe
6483352 no es un experimento la cpi es permanente lleg para quedarse y no trata a ninguna parte del mundo como un experimento
6483353 el hecho es que frica jug un papel incre ble en la creaci n del tribunal
6483354 los casos que investiga la cpi en este momento fueron presentados por los propios estados parte excepto el de darfur que fue remitido por el consejo de seguridad de la onu por tanto no es verdad que el tribunal est concentrado solamente en frica pues la oficina del fiscal ha anunciado p blicamente que sigue de cerca la situaci n en otras partes del mundo por ejemplo en colombia y en afganist n
6483355 frau neid berwiegt nach dem gewonnen spiel um platz drei nun die freude ber die olympische bronzemedaille
6483356 ich freue mich wirklich sehr dass wir dieses spiel zum schluss noch gewonnen haben sonst w ren wir ja ganz umsonst nach peking gekommen so bin ich froh dass wir den medaillenspiegel f r deutschland etwas anheben konnten
6483357 wie zufrieden sind sie mit dem 2 0 gegen japan war es ihr plan die japanerinnen erst m de spielen zu lassen und dann zuzuschlagen
6483358 nein berhaupt nicht wir wollten eigentlich von beginn an nach vorne spielen aber das ist uns berhaupt nicht gelungen wir haben uns viele fehlp sse geleistet und zudem viele chancen f r japan zugelassen deshalb habe ich reagiert und mit conny pohlers und fatmire bajramaj frische spielerinnen gebracht das ist zum gl ck aufgegangen
6483359 uns hat die qualit t im spiel nach vorn gefehlt das hat sich durch alle spiele durchgezogen da haben wir keine gute bewegung und kein gutes passspiel gezeigt da m ssen wir ansetzen

6483366 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry
6483367 were playing in september which is terrific and now it depends on how our form is over the next two weeks as to where we land were in pretty good form which has been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6483368 well need to play some of our best footy because along with ourselves the roos are the form team of the competition
6483369 i think north melbourne has improved a lot from 12 months ago obviously they copped a couple of beltings in the finals last year but everyone knows that isnt the true north melbourne
6483370 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak
6483371 all else equal people would think that in a stable commodity market and a negative financial market people would have more faith in the commodity place
6483372 we have no reports of friendly fire were not sure where these reports started but there is no indication of friendly fire
6483373 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer

6483377 palladium is happy to encourage individuals to talk about and share ideas about our many game worlds settings characters and rules
6483378 if you just needed jeans why didnt you just go to
6483379 nobody has the eagles or the buffalos right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace
6483380 i said before the start of the season that the first four games were ones we were looking at taking points from and nothing is different
6483381 we turned kilmarnock over in the cup last season im sure jim jefferies will have that fresh in their minds and well need to be at our best if we can win then it has been more than a decent start to the season
6483382 their motivation will be to keep our unbeaten run going hopefully that will be enough
6483383 well take it a game at a time but if we could take nine points from nine it would be some achievement
6483384 winning games on the road in the spl is a lot harder than winning games in the first division and although we just did that at inverness its no easy task
6483385 i dont have a problem with us being top of the league and people getting carried away with that at the end of the day you want your team to win
6483386 we carried that mantel last season we know what were trying to do at the club and weve got belief in that
6483387 ich bin begeistert wie meine mannschaft nach dem 0 1 zur ckgekommen ist das war einfach fantastisch
6483388 es ist unglaublich wie die jungs mit dieser drucksituation klargekommen sind
6483389 wir haben zu viel investiert um in den letzten f nf minuten aufzugeben
6483390 unser ziel war immer gold und wir werden auch am samstag noch einmal alles in die waagschale werfen unser weg ist noch lange nicht zu ende
6483391 man schaut den leuten in die augen und hat dann ein gef hl dem man dann folgt
6483392 die holl nder waren jedenfalls nicht so cool wie wir
6483393 cazayoux joined his liberal democrat leadership to oppose energy reform at least 21 times
6483394 cazayoux says one thing in louisiana but hes doing something different in dc
6483395 weve got a list of targets that we are working very hard on
6483396 negotiations are tough and sometimes they are even tougher than usual we know what we are working towards and we know what our objectives are
6483397 the process of signing players sometimes takes time but fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6483398 its no secret hes somebody that weve identified but theres still a bit of work to be done and we await the outcome
6483399 hes a player weve watched for a while and hes got the technical ability and quality to help our squad
6483400 hes not the final piece by a fair way every manager wants another couple of players here or there
6483401 the chairman is aware of which players we want and conversations have been had with certain clubs about certain players
6483402 we hope that things drop in over the next 10 days if not well be as competitive as we can with the players weve got
6483403 i spend my days out on the training field with the players
6483404 i dont know the latest news on these things that youre asking me about
6483405 while hes still here hes still very much a tottenham player thats how we consider things at the moment
6483406 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6483407 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6483408 man kann nicht von pech reden wir sind souver n aus dieser liga verschwunden
6483409 r hrte schneck die werbetrommel bei den fans von denen er hofft dass sie morgen die 1000er marke knacken werden
6483410 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6483411 whether hes actually for sale im not so sure so thats not the only iron weve got in the fire
6483412 its not particularly going brilliantly but were trying to get good players for the right price and that does take a little bit of time because people want to hang on to their players
6483413 if somebody had a crystal ball and said were not going to get any injuries or suspensions before january were fine
6483414 one of the top commentators in college football today we are honored that rece davis has agreed to emcee the nffs marquee event
6483415 rece is a true talent with an unparalleled knowledge of college football and intense passion for our sport his quick wit and entertaining insights will add significantly to the pomp and pageantry of the night as college footballs greatest legends take their rightful place in history
6483416 no stage in college football has seen more legends than the nff annual awards dinner
6483417 its a true honor to have an opportunity to play a role in highlighting the careers and accomplishments of the hall of famers and the nights honorees its also a special thrill for me to follow in the footsteps of broadcasting legend chris shenkel who emceed the event for more than a quarter century in the 60s 70s and 80s
6483418 il ma pris la main ma regard e avec ce regard exceptionnel a dit lactrice je ne my attendais pas jai v cu un moment rare
6483419 das ist nat rlich ein gro artiges gef hl ich bin froh dass ich wieder dabei bin ich werde alles tun damit ich das n chste mal auch wieder eingeladen werde
6483420 beim vierten versuch hat es endlich geklappt wir haben zu null gespielt deshalb bin ich zufrieden ich denke es war ein guter einstand und hoffe dass ich wiederkommen darf
6483421 ich bin aber froh und stolz dass ich f r deutschland gespielt habe
6483422 tasci hat all das umgesetzt was wir von ihm erwartet haben f r das erste l nderspiel hat er seine sache wirklich gut gemacht er ist unglaublich abgekl rt und spielt gut nach vorne
6483423 das ist vergangenheit ich schaue jetzt nur nach vorne die zeit auf mallorca war sehr lehrreich und hat mich in meiner entwicklung weitergebracht zudem habe ich dort die jungens schon alle kennengelernt was ein gro er vorteil ist
6483424 joachim l w wie bewerten sie das 2 0 gegen belgien
6483425 das 2 0 war verdient das ergebnis ist aber zweitrangig ich wollte sehen dass die mannschaft versucht zu kombinieren dass die spielaufl sung gut ist und wir im fluss sind das hat sie sehr gut umgesetzt wir haben den gegner beherrscht in der ersten halbzeit hat nur ein tor gefehlt f r diese fr he phase der saison sind wir aber sehr positiv aufgetreten das war ein gutes warm up f r die wm qualifikation
6483426 wie sch tzen sie das deb t von serdar tasci ein
6483427 f r das erste l nderspiel hat er seine sache wirklich gut gemacht die dinge die ich gefordert habe hat er gut gel st serdar hat taktisch gut gespielt und war stark im zweikampf aber nat rlich haben ihn die belgier auch nicht ganz so gefordert
6483428 ist das innenverteidiger duo tasci und heiko westermann eine alternative zu christoph metzelder und per mertesacker
6483429 die innenverteidigung bei der em war nicht so stark und pr sent wie bei der wm da gab es abstimmungsprobleme wir brauchen daher alternativen weshalb es wichtig war tasci und westermann zu sehen sie haben die sache konsequent umgesetzt ich bin froh ber die alternativen
6483430 in michael ballack und torsten frings mussten sie zwei wichtige spieler ersetzen wie beurteilen sie die leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes
6483431 wir wissen was wir an michael und torsten haben aber ich m chte den konkurrenzkampf haben ich bin froh ber die gute leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes denn das gibt den spielern selbstvertrauen dar ber kann ich als trainer nur froh sein
6483432 das ist ein gesundes selbstbewusstsein er ist schon l nger dabei und sein ziel ist es einfach stammspieler zu werden das ist legitim
6483433 bastian schweinsteiger war gegen belgien in der zweiten h lfte zum ersten mal kapit n und verwandelte den wichtigen elfmeter zum 1 0 kann er der kommende f hrungsspieler werden
6483434 bastian hat bei der em besonders nach dem portugal spiel an selbstevertrauen gewonnen er muss jetzt immer mehr in die verantwortung hineinwachsen um dann eine f hrungsrolle bernehmen zu k nnen
6483435 erneut hat kein st rmer ein tor erzielt bereitet ihnen das sorgen f r die wm qualifikation
6483436 dass mein gegenspieler mich umgesto en und am torschu gehindert hat hab ich ja noch wegstecken k nnen aber als er mich obendrein noch einen pardon gehei en hat habe ich die nerven verloren und nachgetreten
6483437 der verein hat mit bedauern zur kenntnis genommen dass eintracht frankfurt eine erst k rzlich getroffene vereinbarung nicht eingehalten und die fahnen des fsv frankfurt am samstag vor dem heimspiel gegen hertha bsc berlin abgeh ngt hat
6483438 bei den ergebnissen vorne muss ich zufrieden sein 70 meter habe ich nicht alle tage geworfen ich habe die medaille die ich mir vorgenommen habe die gef hle sind aber gemischt
6483439 ich habe hier gek mpft und mit ach und krach 66 meter geschafft irgendwie habe ich nicht mehr auf die reihe gebracht chapeau der regen hat mir zu schaffen gemacht
6483440 reden sie sich ein dass das fritz walter wetter ist
6483441 erstes ziel ist es die gr ten flaschen zu verkaufen gibt es noch pfand daf r super gibt es nichts auch gut
6483442 wir zeigen gewalt rassismus und fremdenfeindlichkeit bei fu ballspielen die rote karte ohne ausnahme
6483443 der dfb steht f r eine null toleranz politik und wird sich jeder form von gewaltt tigen und rassistischen ausschreitungen in aller entschiedenheit entgegenstellen jeder fall von feindseligkeit und verbaler oder gar k rperlicher gewalt ist bereits ein fall zu viel
6483444 unsere stadien d rfen weder von gewaltt tern noch von politischen extremisten im gewande von fu ballfans als kampfbahn missbraucht werden im zusammenwirken mit polizei und sicherheitskr ften werden wir im dfb in der dfl und in den vereinen daher alles unternehmen um derartige vorf lle zu verhindern
6483445 aber der trainer wei doch dass es f r einen brasilianer normal ist dass er zu sp t kommt
6483446 el presidente considera que el se or coronell debi al momento de tener conocimiento de estos hechos haberlos publicado y puesto a consideraci n de la opini n p blica

6483455 it is to the credit of human nature that except where its selfishness is brought into play it loves more readily than it hates
6483456 at a january 2003 fundraiser for cantor who had just become chief deputy whip abramoff unveiled the eric cantor sandwich a tuna based stacker which lamentably was not quite the power lunch befitting the only jewish republican in the house
6483457 most assuredly i say to you before abraham was i am
6483458 i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end
6483459 who is and who was and who is to come the almighty
6483460 it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end i will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts revelation 21 6 i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end the first and the last

6483466 in all aspects of our business our actions are ethical honest and consistent with our values and can withstand scrutiny of the light of day
6483467 i just couldnt believe that my son was killed because we need him
6483468 we heard at least two shots followed by another shot
6483469 ninoy has fulfilled his promise to arrive but something happened inside and that there was shooting
6483470 aquino was being escorted to an avsecom van when the gunman dressed in the blue uniform of an airport maintenance man slipped through the security cordon and shot him from behind with a cal 357 smith and wesson magnum revolver
6483471 we asked him to defer his trip because of this reported assassination attempt
6483472 we did not give him travel papers precisely to discourage him at this time
6483473 he was so concerned with his children more than anything else
6483474 genuine national reconciliation founded on justice which aquino had advocated
6483475 for the best interests of all concerned this attitude of objectivity will better inform the people and tone down any partisan passion
6483476 came from all over the philippines to claim him as their own these solemn grieving dejected filipinos at the aquino residence where the body of the martyred former senator lies in state

6483478 unity yes the stricken sea of humanity which paid homage to aquino was obviously capable of demonstrating but yesterday it was a sense of unity that could no longer be suppressed but rather had to be poured out defiantly albeit peacefully
6483479 i know as surely as i believe in fate that history turned a page that day in a way that inexorably altered the lives of 42 million filipinos the day is huge and vast and awesome in a very real sense and i try to etch it in mind the vast throng jammed in some areas 50 abreast along a 10 kilometer stretch at the heart of manila the sober faces the unspoken grief

6483500 people get themselves into situations because the airport experience puts them in a stressful situation maybe theyre someone who doesnt fly a lot and being at the airport makes them stressed and frustrated thats when we get called in
6483501 someone travelers may think theyve divested themselves of metal but then they set off the machines and have to go through a second screening they may get caustic with a screener and say things that are inappropriate airport law enforcement also responds to those incidents
6483502 you have to recognize that your actions and the items youre carrying are taken very seriously when youre transitioning from the non sterile area of the airport to the sterile secure side of an airport
6483503 once a u s air carriers aircraft door is closed it is deemed to be in flight and is subject to special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states
6483504 good manners are good manners going to an airport can be like going to a wedding or out to nightclub you need to use common sense and common courtesy when youre dealing with people and treat them like youd like to be treated
6483505 traveling is stressful and can bring things out in us that wouldnt happen in normal situations

6483509 schools dress code as applied to ban the confederate flag is constitutional because of the disruptive potential of the flag in a school where racial tension is high and serious racially motivated incidents such as physical altercations or threats of violence have occurred
6483510 that our decision today does not establish a precedent justifying a schools ban on student speech merely because other students find that speech offensive
6483511 they would not be allowed to have rebel flags or symbols of the rebel flag on their clothing or anything else that was a disruption to the school

6483530 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6483531 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6483532 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6483533 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6483535 keine blamage echt blamiert haben sich die belgier nicht aber ein positives resultat war es auch nicht gegen den vize europameister hielt die nationalmannschaft 45 minuten gut dagegen aber ein fehler von daniel van buyten und ein geniestreich von einwechselspieler marin waren fatal und selbst tore schie en das bleibt ein problem

6483540 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6483541 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6483542 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
6483543 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
6483544 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions

6483553 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
6483554 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
6483555 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
6483556 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive
6483557 waiving the fee for a 3rd checked bag for military personnel traveling on northwest airlines is under consideration

6483561 its the heaviest of users that are directly contributing to the degradation of the service for the other people on the network
6483562 its an interesting reflection on the claim that there is a free market for broadband
6483563 if there was competition could you slow down your best customers
6483564 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details
6483565 it would be very easy for there to be an idea that you can hold companies to ransom
6483566 the reality is he gowdiak has done a significant amount of research and clearly its understandable he wants to find a way to monetize that
6483567 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present

6483571 it is deeply unfair that many of the poorest households end up paying more for their energy and water bills because they dont have bank accounts and cant pay by direct debit
6483572 our plan developed with industry will help people struggling with rising household bills by letting them use their post office card account to pay their utility bills
6483573 this fair conservative plan could cut the energy and gas bills of up to four million people by 100 helping many families at a time when the cost of living is rising fast
6483574 the conservatives have been working with industry to develop this sensible and fair policy
6483575 this is a significant weapon for attacking the growing pain of fuel poverty price rises have hit the poorest hardest this is a scheme that would target the most vulnerable in a focused and practical way
6483576 at a time when fuel and other household costs are escalating intensifying the pressures on poorer consumers this proposal offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to help avoid debt and the fact that it might cost less if utilities other creditors and government bodies work together rather than alone must mean it deserves serious consideration
6483577 debt and affordability are serious issues for the water industry the ceos from our 26 member companies therefore support the this proposal and we aim to be an active partner in developing this initiative
6483578 what bothers me is that you arent really getting perks beyond what you currently get as a season ticket holder

6483687 while we are under quarantine we are going to do renovations to our building to ensure the virus is no longer here we are asking people to hold onto any strays they find until we reopen we will give them food to help them care for the animals until we are able to take them
6483688 this is a new strain of parvo we arent seeing any of the regular symptoms of parvo
6483689 it takes about 14 days from the time of exposure for puppies to begin showing symptoms of parvo a dog can come into the shelter shed and then give parvo to other dogs
6483690 parvo is highly contagious dogs can become infected by playing in a yard that is contaminated or from rolling around in infected feces people can transmit it from one place to another on their shoes if i touch a dog that has parvo and then touch another dog that doesnt with the same hand then ive just given that dog parvo
6483691 we are providing banks lots of cash to carry them through while they have these bad loans on their books but yet they are not required to change their business models
6483692 it was difficult to judge initially just how problematic things would become
6483693 nobody dreamed back a year ago bear stearns would have fallen and fannie and freddie would be under threat right now
6483694 is a little bit concerned now that maybe the fed is going to overstay its welcome and almost become japan like in not allowing the natural course of some of these problems to take effect the natural course is for more banks to fail

6483699 the most important thing is that casey is home and her parents are very grateful
6483700 now we are asking the public to please help us find caylee now more than ever we are convinced that she was kidnapped
6483701 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
6483702 youd have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii
6483703 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6483704 cela ne memp che pas de jouer mais jai constamment mal
6483705 we need citizens to call us when they have a law enforcement need
6483706 the last thing i can afford to have is a public policy that you dont call the sheriffs office because you may be sued by one of the responders who is there to protect them
6483707 i was stunned to be served with the lawsuit because at this time no one even knows who wounded the deputies
6483708 was it eddie was it friendly fire its very painful to be victimized once again this time by an opportunistic lawsuit
6483709 we were directly lied to when they said they didnt know who had done it
6483710 we thought it was a random person ground through the neighborhood
6483711 we wouldve handled it entirely different if we had known it was someone from the residence
6483712 people put things in play that made my job more dangerous
6483713 how much fresh water is required for the health of the delta estuary
6483714 there are no regrets to many of the actions we can take now
6483715 we are talking about improving river management and restoring the flood holding and drought proofing services of flood plains and wetlands all of which can be shown to have short term economic social and environmental pay offs
6483716 the fact that they help climate proof our river basins now is an added benefit
6483717 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis in many regions and freshwater systems less able to cope with extreme weather events
6483718 more dams for hydropower is a recipe for even more fragmented rivers that will inhibit freshwater species the food for millions adapting to climate impacts by migrating up or down river systems
6483719 restoration of the 37 sites that make up the lower danube green corridor is estimated to cost 183 million compared to damages of 396 million from the 2005 flood and likely earnings of 85 6 million per year
6483720 this is adaptation to climate impacts even if it is not planned or labeled as adaptation
6483721 this is adaptation that involves and respects the needs of local communities and people and provides immediate benefits mr pittock said
6483722 our studies show that it is often a disaster that leads to the river restoration activities that will increase resilience to climate impacts
6483723 it would make more sense to avoid or reduce the impact of disaster by restoring and strengthening our river systems now
6483724 there is a real need for strengthening the capacity of countries particularly in africa in coping with such climate shocks
6483725 i would therefore like to call for an international deal or
6483726 we need to be pragmatic and move beyond rhetoric to make progress as we move towards copenhagen
6483727 parties meeting under the kyoto protocol must swiftly reach agreement on the rules and tools that will be available to developed countries to meet future emission reduction targets
6483728 this is essential because the toolbox will in turn determine the level of ambition of developed countries when setting their new targets
6483729 parties will look not only at what is needed in terms of funding but also at how funding should be generated in the context of a new international deal and precisely what technologies are required
6483730 the debate will also give an indication of the infrastructure needed to implement a shared vision in the areas of finance technology and capacity building
6483731 agribusiness firms are already spending millions to defeat proposition 2 and they hardly needed an illegal infusion of check off funds authorized by the usda to supplement their political campaign
6483732 there is no reason this advertising campaign must run in california between now and the election unless its true purpose is to illegally influence voter opinions
6483733 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6483734 the fccs action confirms that it is illegal for internet service providers to block or impede access to lawful online content this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to unfettered internet access
6483735 contrary to the claims made by comcast and others the fcc is well within its authority to protect the open internet either by adopting rules or acting on complaints it is the fccs responsibility to promote openness free speech and competition the bedrock goals of the communications act
6483736 standing on the solid legal foundation established today by the fcc internet users must remain vigilant in defending an open internet cable and phone companies would now be wise to obey the law they can trust that the fcc is ready to punish any violations
6483737 here it is like war for us and back home it is war also there is no difference
6483738 we fled from death but death is after us we dont know what is happening to our relatives back home in camps for the displaced staying there would have been better than what happened to us
6483739 the egyptian authorities shameful treatment of sub saharan african migrants and vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees blatantly disregards international law we are calling for urgent intervention by president mubarak to end these abuses
6483740 i think the regulations before they come out will be made known to this committee will be reviewed with this committee
6483741 my intention was to drive from coast to coast and sea to sea but that will probably never happen in my lifetime

6483819 the world under 20 championship is a spectacular event that were extremely pleased to be hosting again
6483820 we had interest in this event from more than 20 different entities across the country weve narrowed the field to three very worthy finalists and look forward to reaching a decision before the end of the year
6483821 it will be a real treat for sports fans in our country to have the world junior championship back in the united states
6483822 its a very special event with an extremely high level of talent
6483823 the last time we hosted the world junior championship back in 2005 fans got to see players like phil kessel sidney crosby and alexander ovechkin to name just a few
6483824 the bottom line for hockey fans is outside of the olympics the world junior championship is probably the best international tournament theyll ever get to witness

6483839 fay has been stationary for the last few hours however a slow motion toward the west northwest is forecast to begin later today and continue for the next couple of days on this track fay is forecast to move slowly across the northern florida peninsula today and be very near the gulf coast of the florida panhandle by early saturday
6483840 in one way or another it has impacted the entire state
6483841 its completely boxed in to its north and to its west until the high pressure system moves its not going anywhere
6483842 as the storm moves back on shore its going to start to weaken
6483843 the north is starting to get some of what they havent had before the good times are over
6483844 but some of the southwest is where we are seeing some of the most flooding right now a lot of roads are also closed in other areas so were hoping residents will heed our warning to stay off the roads or use extreme caution

6483849 getting blasted every 15 minutes or so with winds of 25 30 mph and heavy rain i live in south titusville and figure we are going to have a real wet windy night tonight and possibly a moderatly wet day thur we have some limbs down political signs down and some debris littering the roadways
6483850 vehicles going up and down the streets are causing waves to go inside houses
6483851 if you have an emergency or if you are going to or coming back from work that is ok
6483852 driving during the night will be difficult it will be difficult to find out where the edge of the road is
6483853 some of the roads are next to canals that are 10 to 15 feet deep
6483854 we have not made any requests for the national guard but it is available to us
6483855 we also have a lot of people getting stuck in the water if you get stuck call a wrecker because we cant risk putting our patrol cars through that unless its a matter of life or death
6483856 weve also gotten calls from people asking us to block off flooded roads palm bay is nearly 100 square miles and for us to go out to block every road is not feasible
6483857 people are calling and asking for that and we cant get to them
6483858 were also looking at unconfirmed reports of water intrusion in some homes
6483859 theres flooding all over and were closing roads all over the city
6483860 right now we have seven lift stations that are underwater but theyre still pumping we have 50 out of 101 total stations that are maxed out right now we dont have any sewage spilling into the streets but people need to stay out of the standing water
6483861 we are asking people to restrict water usage dont do laundry dont wash dishes flush toilets on a limited basis
6483862 the system is doing the best it can but if any one of those lift stations fail we will have a risk of contamination
6483863 theres nothing more we can do until water levels recede
6483864 there will be more than normal wind but not as much as today
6483865 right now were getting ready to close down these roads because its all flooded back there and were getting cars stuck in the water were also getting reports of the water reaching up to several homes
6483866 were advising people that well transport t hem out but were also hearing that malabar road and babcock street is also now flooded
6483867 we have 41 out of 101 lift stations working at a high rate but theyre getting the job done

6483869 in march i quit my job borrowed 30k from family members and put everything on the line to build a company around the iphone platform i now have a great product thats been ready for over a month but hasnt seen the light of day apple didnt properly prepare for the flood my user friendly functional application has languished while 22 tip calculators 8 flashlights and even i am rich made it to the store and worse yet there has been a complete lack of communication about any of it procedures contracts status time estimates etc the dream of creating great iphone apps has turned into a personal nightmare ive been losing sleep feeling sick gaining weight and i just about had an emotional breakdown today
6483870 yesterday i noticed from my itunes that apple had recently released 2 0 1 for the iphone i downloaded the 240 megabyte update a little while later i received an unknown error 6 and the update aborted but not until after it had erased my phone so for the second time in the past couple of months my phone became a brick my impression is that apple cant cope with the success of the iphone and the demands it puts on their engineering and support organizations
6483871 i am a doctor but not a good typist and i have found that dragon naturallyspeaking dns is indispensable in making entries into my electronic medical record emr program dns has saved me literally thousands of hours in the last few years in updating my patients records but i purchased a copy of dns version 10 as soon as it was available and tried to begin dictating into my emr dns stopped dead a dialog box appeared stating that the only version of naturally speaking 10 that would dictate into an emr was the medical version of dragon which costs 10 times the price very sad that nuance has chosen to take the low road in dealing with its new and established customers
6483872 you are correct that we decided to remove emr support from the non medical versions of dragon
6483873 having said that please note that along with the launch of dragon medical 10 in september we will announce attractive upgrade offers for customers who have been using non medical dragon versions in medical settings
6483874 yesterday i took my second iphone home after the first one wouldnt hold a charge this one charged and worked fine except for one thing i noticed last night that it had cube runner and facebook apps installed something i know i did not download because i havent downloaded any apps yet i also found somebody elses bookmarks on this iphone at some point in the apple chain someone clearly made a decision to put a returned used iphone back in the box seal it and try to pass it off as brand new
6483875 as im sure you know the new iphone is plagued with connectivity issues its terrible i live and work in midtown manhattan and i have trouble getting good reception also even when there are full bars on the 3g icons my emails dont download or send i regularly have tons of e mails stuck in outbox apple discussion boards have a lot on this but of course no word from apple 10 more per month for 3g service for this

6483886 it shows carta how many students use the service or if they need to increase routes it also shows the college the service is being used

6483941 it is my belief that russia has the best understanding about the situation about its own interest i do hope that not only russia but other states join not only the understanding of the need to stop iran but join more effective sanctions in order to do so

6483992 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6483993 it would lessen the stress on local bars there would be judiciaries who could be dealing with real crimes it would be easier on the administration

6483995 you volunteered to give your life im not volunteering to die at your hands because youre trashed and driving drunk
6483996 we have to teach our young ones that this is a responsibility that you have treat it with respect

6484002 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens

6484008 so let us replace the always problematic word realism with the much more problematic word truth
6484009 sure i recognize that the novel is in a tough spot and that much of the work being produced does not fall under the category of truth to which i think the novel ought to aspire but what can i do facts is facts sometimes the world doesnt turn out the way we want it to

6484041 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6484042 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used

6484082 het ivoriaanse volk heeft geen rechten de machthebbers gaan hun eigen gang daarom stelt het me zo teleur dat nederland wel een democratie tegen alle regels de probo koala liet vertrekken de autoriteiten in amsterdam wisten hoe gevaarlijk het afval aan boord was ze hadden dat nooit mogen laten gaan de conventie van basel door nederland ondertekend verbiedt dat zon conventie is juist bedoeld om kwetsbare landen als ivoorkust te beschermen aangezien onze eigen regering dat niet doet wat is anders de functie van het internationale recht nederland mag zijn verantwoordelijkheid niet ontkennen het is schuldig

6484211 compared to just a few years ago im seeing at least a 50 percent increase in patients in their 60s 70s and even 80s with allergies or allergic like symptoms
6484212 there are many more mature patients with asthma and in many cases these are people who never had allergies or asthma before
6484213 the warmer temperatures weve been experiencing extend the growing season which itself increases the growth and potency of tree and grass pollens
6484214 and carbon dioxide by itself is a source for plant growth together these factors could be the perfect storm for allergy problems so to speak
6484215 carbon dioxide stimulates all plants but it stimulates weedy plants such as ragweed more so
6484216 poison ivy is not only growing larger but its itch causing oil is getting stronger because of increased c02
6484217 airborne pollen binds with diesel particles to go deep into the lungs where it irritates and can manifest into asthma
6484218 and nitrates in diesel also aggravate the same cells that cause allergic reactions as people get older their lung function is already compromised for several reasons smoking pollution and the natural aging process so with new assaults you are more likely to get a reaction
6484219 this is especially problematic for older folks who may be allergic and already at risk for anaphylaxis
6484220 we know that among those with insect venom allergies there is an increased risk of bad outcome in patients over age 60 thats because certain medications they take such as beta blockers already increase the risk and severity of anaphylaxis and the medications we use to control it dont work as well add to that the heart and lung troubles older people have and it doesnt take much for them to get into trouble
6484221 when i go outside in the morning and have to literally wipe off a blanket of pollen from my car im very concerned about how much of it im breathing
6484222 i used to be able to work in my garden pull out poison ivy and just wash it off with no problem now i scrub my arms immediately afterward and still cant remove it
6484223 whether its global warming or just bad luck theres no question that im suffering more than i used to

6484229 they said i was afraid of heights but i was doing 60 jumps a day then which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do

6484278 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6484279 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6484280 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6484281 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6484282 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6484283 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6484284 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6484285 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6484286 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6484287 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6484288 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6484289 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6484290 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6484291 sottoscritto con firma digitale nel rispetto della normativa anche regolamentare concernente la sottoscrizione dei documenti informatici
6484292 le norme del decreto legislativo che sono soprattutto norme di recepimento nella specifica materia delle disposizioni comunitarie non sembrano recepire correttamente il diritto comunitario nel diritto interno e soprattutto sembrano alterare il sistema delle prove nel processo civile in altri termini come dalla sottoscrizione autografa si ricava la presunzione di legge sino a prova contraria del consenso del firmatario sul contenuto del documento cos dalla sottoscrizione del documento informatico mediante la firma digitale lordinamento dovrebbe trarre le medesime presunzioni legali identificando nellautore della firma digitale lautore del documento informatico a cui attribuire gli effetti dellatto
6484293 in conclusione il documento informatico munito di firma digitale sembra porsi per effetto dellinversione dellonere della prova in tema di disconoscimento come una sorta di tertium genus tra la scrittura privata e latto pubblico avendo in giudizio la stessa efficacia probatoria di una scrittura privata munita di una sottoscrizione legalmente riconosciuta ed essendo in realt in nulla diverso da una scrittura privata munita di sottoscrizione non autenticata

6484327 his execution his drops and his delivering the ball on time whats hes been doing looks like a guy whos played the game of football in our system where the other two kids are young and very talented but they are looking right when they should be looking left
6484328 the more he plays the better he gets and the more comfortable he feels
6484329 everything goes fast well the more you play it slows down your execution gets better the more he plays the more he executes the offense much better
6484330 now it depends on who it is if it is russell wilson maybe we will take him and put daniel in just so he can settle down and look at the defense i cant answer that right now but ive done it before
6484331 our buddy dan abrams hes been replaced by rachel maddow or will be in early september hes losing his show to somebody with more testosterone than he has
6484332 one of my favorite people of all time is ms
6484333 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children

6484335 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6484336 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6484337 theyre not my group anymore im on my own and i would rather do that than go back to the beach boys
6484338 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
6484339 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6484340 everybody played out of their skin musically lyrically and sonically its the best record weve made
6484341 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations
6484342 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen
6484343 we entered into the green label sound program because we saw it as an opportunity to put a song out to the whole world with the backing of something that everyone grew up on
6484344 mountain dew is not trying to push their product through music like everyone else they just wanna support music and with us tying to set up our new record without a record company mountain dew gives us an unexpected helping hand to get up those steps
6484345 green label sound is giving artists like ourselves an opportunity to get to a different scale than we were previously on the program gives us a further reach than we wouldve had on our own but we still get to keep the same creative independence that we like to have
6484346 on behalf of the philadelphia eagles i am very saddened and shocked to learn of gene upshaws passing this morning
6484347 whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person
6484348 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
6484349 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6484350 cooperative and non confrontational enforcement has always been and remains the norm and preference of everyone in the community through this guide we further advance that goal by providing even more information to help those who commercialize floss to comply easily from the start
6484351 the crop of boys coming through are really top players
6484352 were counting on a few of them at the minute and they havent let us down theyre looking really good
6484353 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6484354 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6484355 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6484356 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6484357 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6484358 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6484359 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6484360 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6484361 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6484362 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6484363 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6484364 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6484365 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6484366 its just a whole bunch of little things that started adding up
6484367 i didnt get a sense i was accomplishing anything anymore
6484368 i think weve lost sight of what we really should be focusing on
6484369 are we holding this applicant to a higher standard that we held another applicant weve got to be consistent
6484370 im just wondering if my goals and the goals of others were in conflict here
6484371 i do think were losing a valuable resource in somebody that has tremendous knowledge of the environmental issues in the town and has been working hard to preserve the natural resources of the town
6484372 hes stood up to people that have tried to circumvent those things and he will be a loss in that respect
6484373 i think its a great loss for the town because of the amount of work hes put in on issues that dont come to the public eye
6484374 people were using conservation for their reason for everything when they were never there for every other conservation issue in the past
6484375 my feeling was its a very tricky situation very complex and it should sink or swim on its own merits
6484376 i truly believe theres been a greater awareness not just by the people in exeter but everywhere about what conservation means doing things that are environmentally sound protecting our rivers and so forth
6484377 i think that makes you feel good that you no longer have to get up and be the only one arguing something
6484378 ive loved the working relationship ive had with a lot of people in town i cannot speak more highly of the dpw they have been so great
6484379 considering the fact i was going on three hours sleep i felt pretty good
6484380 its my goal to get back and help the team make a run at the playoffs
6484381 i think everyone here wants to do that especially when your team is in that playoff hunt its harder to think like that when your club is out of the playoffs thats when guys have trouble concentrating
6484382 petter har fortfarande n got att s ga och f rm ga att formulera det p ett snitsigt s tt
6484383 i am expecting to use both of them based on the situation and when you consider that justin even watching him kick the ball off knowing that if you kick the ball out of bounds knowing where that ball is going to start in terms of scoring and for every yard of field position an opponent gains on a return their chance of scoring goes up that part of it is even if he is not the field goal kicker a huge asset to our team
6484384 do you all have no lives and just babble about what goes on in your personal lives

6484411 the defense department has spent billions to fix its antiquated financial systems but still has no idea where its money goes

6484413 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much
6484414 why it takes decades to get them into production even as innovation in the civilian economy becomes ever more frenetic and why some of those weapons dont work very well despite expenditures of many billions of dollars

6484430 como pol tica es equivocada y en caso de que sea v lida la pol tica de subsidios nunca hay que subsidiar al empresario sino al usuario del transporte esto deber a hacerse mediante los municipios
6484431 no solo es injusto porque en capital federal y el conurbano la tarifa sale 50 por ciento menos sino porque no miden igualdades en buenos aires los trenes son un desastre y a pesar de que se subsidian a las empresas no hay obligaci n de dar un mejor servicio
6484432 el dinero deber a llegar por un canal normal a los municipios y estos deber an crear un boleto obrero un boleto estudiantil un boleto para gente con escasos recursos esto es posible pero d ndole el dinero a los municipios darles la plata a los empresarios es equivocado

6484438 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6484439 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys

6484454 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6484455 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6484456 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6484457 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6484458 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6484459 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6484460 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6484461 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6484462 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother
6484463 the first priority of physicians is the health and well being of our patients
6484464 20 4 6 soon the people of judah learned of the defeat of assyria and then of egypt

6484467 we want to show that we are part of this community and what better way to show that than coming to the state fair which gets people of all different backgrounds
6484468 all they want to do is spread a little knowledge
6484469 i think we all agree that children should have the status of personhood and right now there are x children who do not have access to health care so i think its best that we focus on them
6484470 its not normal that someone severely burned gets thrown in a car taken to the hospital
6484471 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6484472 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6484473 the loan repayment provision applies equally to all candidates regardless of whether they or their opponents have triggered the increased campaign contribution limits
6484474 the fact that all the republican and democratic members of the fec totally rejected senator lautenberg self serving attempt to pay off his personal campaign loans with unlimited special interest contributions reveals how outrageous it was
6484475 it is disappointing that at a time when new jersey families are struggling with soaring gas prices and property taxes senator lautenberg was scheming to put unlimited special interest money into his personal bank account
6484476 once again washington republican dick zimmer is making partisan attacks that are flat out wrong
6484477 in order to comply with a new law senator lautenberg had simply asked the fec to clarify its
6484478 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome
6484479 i have a big fear of speaking in front of groups of people so nothing like facing that fear head on

6484498 rigorous and credible process for identifying the states most excellent teachers
6484499 if teachers want to link higher level skills and professional recognition to higher pay then we would readily examine that as part of our wages negotiations
6484500 the rudd government has also indicated it is interested in developing proposals to reward higher level teaching and wed welcome input by the commonwealth in this debate
6484501 we are simply concerned that the best teachers be recognised
6484502 the key to this system is that we actually identify the best teachers our emphasis is that the process is credible to both teachers and the community
6484503 we would like to be involved in investigating and discussing the idea of higher levels of accreditation as something that could be recognised by additional pay
6484504 it is critical for the government to put new money in for this because if there is no new money some teachers will be paid extra at the expense of others

6484515 high costs of fossil fuels alongside technological breakthroughs and decreasing costs with growing economies of scale will play out well for res which have developed into an industry to reckon with and are also underpinned by growing government support and concerns about global warming
6484516 sustainable energy investment was 70 9 billion us dollars in 2006 an increase of 43 percent over 2005 the sectors with the highest levels of investment are wind solar and biofuels which reflects technology maturity policy incentives and investor appetite
6484517 the gcc countries were reluctant to adopt renewable energy although they have favourable conditions the attitude was that they are sitting atop a sea of oil and gas which will last forever and therefore alternatives need not be contemplated
6484518 energy security climate change and sustainable development require engaging aligning and collectively committing to investing in and shaping a better and more secure future through masdar we want to play a major role in developing solutions that answer present challenges we are not simply a renewable energy initiative our aspirations are far higher we truly believe that we can make a difference
6484519 this is one of the most significant re projects in the gcc thus far it seems that the government of abu dhabi has taken up the saudi initiatives of the 1980s on a much larger scale in order to take advantage of the technological progress and the improved economics that have taken place in res since then

6484523 tan extra a que los investigadores no pudieron decidir qu sexo asignarles
6484524 a ello habr a que a adir que estas hormonas no son degradables son excretadas f cilmente en la orina de las mujeres la cual luego va a parar primero en la alcantarilla y despu s a la planta de tratamiento de agua tales plantas no est n equipadas para tratar con hormonas as que el agua purificada liberada en los r os circundantes y riachuelos va mezclada con estr geno

6484526 ante la posibilidad de escoger entre proteger el medioambiente y continuar impulsando el control poblacional en el mundo parece ser que muchos ecologistas radicales escoger an lo ltimo
6484527 uno podr a imaginarse que los ecologistas atentos a combatir cualquier amenaza a la naturaleza estar an prestos a levantarse en armas pero todav a ninguno ha exigido prohibir estas hormonas tan contaminantes o por lo menos demandado instalar resguardos para proteger el abastecimiento de agua en lugar de eso aparentemente el movimiento ecologista ha sufrido una generalizada y s bita par lisis lar ngea
6484528 los pocos que han levantado la voz han responsabilizado a las imitaciones de estr geno
6484529 los qu micos en algunos jabones y detergentes pueden enga ar al cuerpo y producirle una reacci n como si estos qu micos fueran estr genos
6484530 tambi n se mantienen firmes en que la causa principal de dicha anormalidad es el prol fico uso de m todos anticonceptivos hormonales en el rea de denver y boulder otros estudios realizados en lugares tan lejanos con suiza han confirmado que el problema se ha expandido y puede ser que crezca y empeore
6484531 en el pri no estamos sorprendidos por el silencio del grupo ecologista la mayor a de ecologistas radicales son pro aborto y propugnan el control poblacional por lo tanto lo ltimo que ellos podr an criticar son las drogas anticonceptivas que les ayudan a lograr sus dos cometidos

6484596 its a pretty different team to the test side and a lot of lads have come in wanting to impress and cement spots within the side so theres a freshness about the squad
6484597 kevin has obviously taken over as captain and everyone is eager to impress england for a long time now have under performed in one day cricket and weve got a chance to address that now and hopefully put some performances in

6484600 theyre the form side theyve beaten everyone theyve come up against
6484601 they are a formidable team in one day internationals and its going to be tough for us but weve got to test ourselves against these sides
6484602 weve beaten the best sides in the world before but weve got to beat them over a period of time and not just in one off games
6484603 hes won his only test and in the past week or so theres been a really nice feel about the camp
6484604 kevins taken to the job really well he was really enthusiastic about doing it and i dont see why he cant be a successful captain for a while
6484605 hes stamping his own character onto the job weve seen the way he plays and hes bringing that into his captaincy and bringing that into the team a little bit as well
6484606 hes confident hes single minded hes an aggressive bloke and his team especially in the last test match also played like that and i wouldnt be surprised if the same thing happens in the one dayers
6484607 kevin is keen for people to express themselves and have no fear of failure but theres a balance between doing that and being reckless and weve got to find that balance as a team

6484635 for over two years weve focused on delivering a cost effective web scale infrastructure to developers giving them complete flexibility in the kinds of solutions they deliver
6484636 persistent block storage has been among the top requests of developers using amazon ec2 and were excited to deliver amazon elastic block storage designed specifically for our cloud based elastic computing environment
6484637 first amazon ec2 rewrote the rules of cloud computing offering companies an intuitive and reliable means for accessing unlimited computing power with amazon ebs amazon has turned the industry on its head again providing unlimited storage potential
6484638 at wired com were leveraging amazon ec2 to power our embeddable widgets and wired product reviews using ec2 weve been able to build and deploy applications more quickly and reliably ebs is the missing link the last piece in the cloud computing puzzle that enables start ups and large corporations alike to conjure the resources they need to build any application possible persistence is key to most applications and ebs provides more flexibility in this area than anything previously available we are developing a platform in the semantic web space with requirements for unlimited fast reliable persistence ec2 and ebs not only make this application feasible they make it cost effective and scalable
6484639 sharethis has received tremendous benefits from working with amazon web services for our leading sharing platform
6484640 amazon ebs has enabled us to create large scale enterprise level databases that allow us to run and maintain various disparate applications ec2 and ebs together provide a cost effective flexible system that allows us to crunch data faster than we had been previously able giving us a much needed advantage for our business
6484641 suns mysql is the one of the most popular databases on amazon ec2 with the introduction of ebs mysql users will be able to increase the durability and portability of their database applications deployed in the cloud
6484642 with sun also recently making the opensolaris platform available on ec2 web companies can now access the unique features of the zfs file system such as rollback and 128 bit checksum capabilities to enable the highest level of data integrity on ec2
6484643 with the release of amazon elastic block store the ability to deploy any application anywhere including the cloud is a reality by providing a persistent and consistent compute environment both on premise and in the cloud red hat enterprise linux and jboss eap on amazon ec2 will help achieve the vision of the virtual datacenter
6484644 now with the highly anticipated release of amazon ebs our enterprise ec2 customers have the ability to persist virtual machine configuration and application data across instantiations and manage their cloud solutions in as consistent a manner as their on premise deployments
6484645 amazon ebs adds significant value to the product development effort at elastra were able to provide our customers with seamless automated database recovery and an enhanced persistent data solution with faster throughput all without their needing to manage cumbersome scripting
6484646 these are the types of capabilities our customers especially the isvs and enterprises are looking for amazon ebs functionality allows our team to focus on delivering more advanced capabilities for our offering where scaling relational databases is essential the resulting benefit to our customers is that they save time and can in turn devote their resources to business differentiating activities which drive innovation and new revenue streams

6484660 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6484661 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6484662 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6484675 develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
6484676 the desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the united states in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of cuba and to develop an international image of a cuban threat to peace in the western hemisphere
6484677 create an incident which has the appearance of an attack on u s facilities gmo in cuba thus providing an excuse for use of u s military might to overthrow the current government of cuba
6484678 the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that should the mercury manned orbit flight fail the fault lies with the communists et al cuba sic
6484679 this to be accomplished by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the cubans
6484680 a contrived cuban attack on an oas member could be set up and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self defense and request assistance from the u s and oas

6484689 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack

6484745 national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6484746 we still do have a great concern about the governments arbitrary target of branding all schools as failures who do not achieve 30 a cs at gcse

6484755 even when i barely understood football he always allowed me to attend events like the nfl gridiron dinner and parties ill always remember his smile and warmth and his genuine desire to see young african americans get involved in professional sports he will be truly missed
6484756 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6484757 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6484758 this is an exciting time for our business as were seeing an upsurge of interest in insight communities from companies around the world
6484759 whats more were continuing to renew communities with existing customers at a rate of more than 90 which is not only proof that our communities are seen as long term strategic assets but also that were continuing to deliver results that matter

6484784 if we see that banks become very dependent on central banks then we must stimulate them to tap other sources of funding
6484785 the risk exists that ecb funding is used by banks to originate collateral that some may deem excessively risky in the future
6484786 weve taken note of a new trend toward single ratings
6484787 we are examining our rules with great care and watching developments carefully and we will see what we have to do if it proves necessary to refine elements of our scheme as we have done in the past because we did that two years ago and four years ago

6484797 i see people getting killed and injured because of speed its very frustrating i see it again and again
6484798 its getting better but we have a long way to go
6484799 there is no harm with a passenger saying slow down youre going to kill us
6484800 its one more example of the tragedy that results when someone shows complete disregard for the law their own life and that of others on the roads
6484801 that and the new legislation that enables us to suspend the licence and impound the vehicle on the spot of motorists driving more than 50 kilometres over the posted speed limit appear to finally be having a positive effect on motorists driving behaviour
6484802 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6484803 its not my job to go into an election because the prime minister asked me to go into an election my job is to replace him and timing is important

6484805 who said that the cabinet has given the okay to hezbollah to carry out any action against israel
6484806 major efforts and there have been no complaints against hezbollah
6484807 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah
6484808 during the second lebanese war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hezbollah attacks
6484809 for forests to be maximally effective in addressing climate change these findings suggest the focus of australian forest policy should be upon preserving primary forests with strict protections from industrial development and focusing upon regenerating natural forests old growth characteristics while meeting needs for certified forest products
6484810 if australia papua new guinea and indonesia are sincere in their efforts to establish payments for forest protection and if these efforts are really going to protect regional climate and biodiversity they are going to have to forego industrial forestry in each of their remaining primary forests anything else is greenwash with grave local and global ramifications
6484811 it is preposterous to impose massive costs upon society for a new carbon trading market while ignoring how first time industrial logging of primary forests in australia and regionally is a primary driver of climate change

6484815 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
6484816 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

6484837 in or around the summer of 2008 apple began marketing and put out for consumption the defective iphone 3g
6484838 the release for consumption of the defective iphone 3g was preceded and followed by an aggressive marketing campaign which included radio television and paper advertisements
6484839 soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers through the device were slower than expected and advertised
6484840 plaintiff was familiar with the speeds at which the previous iphone operated the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6484841 said failure to connect to said 3g standard and protocol occurred in the metropolitan area of birmingham alabama where plaintiff works plays and lives

6484858 this is absolutely terrific for research it allows our scientists to really have the infrastructure that they need to i believe take us to the next level
6484859 we have some terrific scientists but oftentimes its not only the people that you need but also the equipment and technology this actually takes the people gives them the technology and allows them to put their ideas which are world class ideas on the world stage
6484860 uhn fortunately already has a pretty good international reputation but the more we can have unique facilities then the more opportunities our scientists have to make the fundamental discoveries that become the currency of international reputations
6484861 by building these kinds of facilities we allow our scientists to do things that they couldnt do without them and thats what they build their reputations on

6484870 theyre going to want more than were willing to give
6484871 a lot of our funding is at the provincial level and the foundations and corporates want to see matching funds from the federal government or at least some support from the federal government
6484872 just as the vancouver dance community is starting to come into stride future international touring possibilities are going to be much more challenging in terms of actually being able to finance them when they come along
6484873 what weve been using the funding for is to bring international presenters into canada to see canadian work
6484874 thirty seven percent of the plays that have been presented have received an invitation to tour internationally thats huge and none of that will be happening thanks to these cuts

6484882 although the proportion of crude oil consumption produced in germany is comparatively small at 3 7 million tons domestic production covers just 3 percent of demand in germany any production on ones own doorstep increases supply security
6484883 they can be used to significantly prolong the life of existing older oil fields
6484884 wintershall is willing to invest more in the latest technologies in order to extend the production time of existing older fields
6484885 a higher average price for crude oil certainly has a positive impact on exploration and production activities in germany
6484886 projects become more economically viable and existing fields can be exploited for longer a higher market price also gives us the opportunity to invest more in germany for example in the use of state of the art technology
6484887 we could have provided clean energy for a million homes or reduced our dependence on foreign oil

6484905 dissociation a form of hypnotic trance helps children to survive abuse and it is key to memory repression the abuse takes on a dream like surreal quality and deadened feelings and altered perceptions add to the strangeness the whole scene does not fit into the real world it is simple tc forget easy to believe nothing happened

6484934 seller downpayment assistance has helped more than one million americans who are able to afford a monthly payment but do not have the downpayment needed to become homeowners
6484935 while the mortgage rescue package contains numerous provisions to aid hardworking american homeowners it is regrettable that charitable downpayment assistance funded by sellers was omitted from this otherwise comprehensive package
6484936 if we can maintain fha loans with downpayment assistance from the government employers unions parents or family we can maintain loans with assistance from sellers i believe that we should compare apples to apples when discussing the foreclosure rates associated with seller downpayment assisted loans
6484937 i introduced this bi partisan bill h r 6694 to revive this critical program under new standards that will effectively balance the risk of potential foreclosures with the goal of increasing homeownership
6484938 seller downpayment assistance helps hardworking americans achieve the dream of homeownership with no cost to taxpayers i strongly believe that we can mend the seller downpayment assistance program rather than end the program by passing h r 6694
6484939 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6484940 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6484950 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6484951 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6484952 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6484953 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6484954 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6484955 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6484956 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6484957 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6484958 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6484959 kim previously declined the offer for the cover citing her religious beliefs and devotion to god but a source close to kim says
6484960 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6484961 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6484962 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6484963 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6484964 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6484965 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6484966 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6484967 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6484970 for the purpose of this feature we decided to interview martijn by committee to give him not only the chance to write about aspects of his work that interested him most but also the choice not to write about other aspects which although no where near as interesting as what he has to say is interesting in itself
6484971 the central piece is a representation of the beautiful experience of a drop falling into water creating an enigmatic movement and ripples the installation uses innovative and sophisticated technology in an unexpected and inventive way to capture this captivating natural phenomenon
6484972 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6484973 this is the fifth annual report and with each and every year we see more evidence the obesity epidemic is gaining speed and destructive force
6484974 the problem in india is that students get only degrees and no skills
6484975 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6484976 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6484977 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6484978 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6484979 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6484980 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6484981 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6484982 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6484983 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6484984 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6484985 who are open to doing something on the production side
6484986 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6484987 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6484988 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6484989 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6484990 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6484991 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6484992 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6484993 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6484994 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6484995 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6484996 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6484997 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6484998 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6484999 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6485000 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6485001 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6485002 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6485003 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6485004 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6485005 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6485006 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6485007 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6485008 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6485009 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6485010 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6485011 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6485012 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6485013 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6485014 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6485015 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6485016 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6485017 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6485018 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6485019 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6485020 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6485021 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6485022 au erdem sichern wir durch diesen gemeinsamen schritt von mlp und bedeutenden produktpartnern dauerhaft das gesch ftsmodell des unabh ngigen beratungshauses

6485027 commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established
6485028 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6485029 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6485030 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6485031 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6485032 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6485033 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6485034 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6485035 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6485036 this impregnable canister will keep your food safe from bears and discourage them from entering the campsites

6485039 without a hearing without any input from the state without any representation by the states attorney or the attorney general without a process or procedure simply a petition and certain findings made by the court
6485040 however i would say that this legislation has zero chance of becoming law

6485057 theres no money for sports so the results are no surprise
6485058 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6485059 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6485060 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6485064 rewritable printing is an excellent option for several specific applications
6485065 the high level of security nor a full color glossy image like with our hdp branded printers but the ability to print and erase cards 200 times can stretch id budgets in ways that satisfy end users with other priorities
6485066 the card itself includes a thermo sensitive material which becomes visible when heated at a temperature of 180 c followed by rapid cooling when a lower temperature is applied typically between 110 c and 160 c the color disappears the thermo sensitive material is laminated on a plastic substrate to make cards
6485067 we manufacture an iclass contactless card with a rewritable surface say for visitor or temporary badges for contractors or employees who need access to facilities for temporary periods
6485068 issuing iclass cards can become quite expensive to such parties but it makes sense when you can leverage that expense over a number of uses with the rewritable card
6485069 we have a large pilot project outside the u s where the government has mandated that all students carry a photo id with one side containing the rewritable information such as a class schedule bus schedule emergency contact information etc the reverse side has the full color identification information including the students photo
6485070 businesses encourage customers to carry their cards and keep track of their purchases accumulated value imaged onto the card is more secure than with paper punch cards and updating and erasing points is easy since its simple to remove the cartridge based ribbons from the fargo printers
6485071 obviously if youre able to buy a card and use it 200 times youre saving quite a bit of money
6485072 bonus points or special offers are printed directly at the point of sale after each transaction
6485073 they are also a good choice for visitor badges the same card can be used to erase the info of a visitor and print it for a new one in sophisticated applications the card will include contactless chips allowing identification of the holder and giving access to specific areas of the building the printer is then part of the visitor management system including software visitor database and card readers
6485074 because no ribbon is necessary tattoo rewrite is a cost effective and environment friendly solution
6485075 projects worldwide show the success of rewritable smart cards such as student id cards electronic tickets in public transport and for events ski passes visitor and employee id cards club and loyalty cards and many more
6485076 when equipped with a read write module for chip rf chip or magnetic cards the information also can be changed electronically in your card
6485077 the focus is to find an application for reusing the card and update information on the card as well as electronically in the card you dont have to throw the card away after use this level of reusability and update possibility ensures that the costs of electronic systems are drastically reduced
6485078 offers both full color monochrome card printing and rewritable card technology
6485079 which to our understanding is the lowest cost card printer offering both rewritable and full color card printing capability in one printer
6485080 the markets applications we are targeting are retail visitor management transportation education and entertainment the possibilities for creative uses of this technology in various applications are unlimited
6485081 the most important reason is the major reduction in the security of the card
6485082 if you have a card that can be rewritten all i need is a printer to rewrite it and i can fake your cards whenever i want its about as secure as putting stickers on a card to validate it it was designed as a convenience to the end user but with the extremely low cost of standard pvc cards and inexpensive direct card printing it doesnt make much sense to us
6485083 reissuing a rewritable temporary id may sound like a good idea but the real question is whether an id is really needed at all for visitors
6485084 if it needs to be personalized is it because your facility honestly needs to be secure if so a rewritable card is an unnecessary risk if your facility doesnt need to be secure then what is the need to re personalize the visitor card why not just issue generic visitor ids that can still be tracked in the system and reused for the next visitor
6485085 i have yet to see an instance where re printing a card can handle what re encoding it already can do better the purpose of a loyalty card is to advertise the issuing company and linking the user to the benefits offered i imagine that a discount card could be used up by one end user and then returned and re issued to another but not without a significant amount of loss or damage of the card beyond re use the savings for the number returned and re issued would have to be significant to validate the switch in technology if the turnover is that quick then paper or teslin cards might be more cost effective
6485086 looking for secure credential solutions with layered methods for making the card tamper resistant not just a means for cheap card personalization we know of a few venues that thought the idea of rewritable cards sounded interesting but we havent seen any demand for it at all we see this as a buzzword technology that may create enough public interest to make some initial sales but does not have lasting market value
6485087 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity

6485160 cutting down trees in a sustainable harvested forest which is what we draw our supply from is just like taking out corn or flowers and replanting them next year
6485161 from the hotels perspective this fits in very well with our recycling efforts our energy conservation

6485164 please please help us we are losing our treasure our freedom i am almost crying because im seeing my country is falling
6485165 states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access
6485166 some states block access to a wide swathe of content while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets south korea for example tends to block access only to sites related to north korea
6485167 filtering can help shape the message a countrys citizens see including as may have happened recently when georgia filtered some russian web sites for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching ones citizens
6485168 filtering isnt the primary technological way that internet freedom can be compromised
6485169 another type of cyberwarfare that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information as well as planting trojans or viruses
6485170 they range from the electronic frontier foundations tor software to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and buddy system software like psiphon which allows a person in one place to handle requests for web sites from someone in a place that filters

6485178 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6485179 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either
6485180 its an unwelcome development that distributors and consumers all having a hard time could have done without
6485181 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6485182 maybe you are struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home but recently john mccain said the fundamentals of our economy are strong hm then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6485183 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6485184 i guess if you think that being rich means you got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6485185 but if you are like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6485186 im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6485187 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go
6485188 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6485189 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school

6485191 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6485192 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6485193 the more things change the more things stay the same
6485194 this stuff is a lot harder than some people make it out to be
6485195 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6485196 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6485197 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6485198 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6485199 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6485200 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable

6485203 ich habe mit doping f llen in peking gerechnet und bin deshalb nicht berrascht
6485204 dass mit blonska eine wiederholungst terin auftritt zeigt mit welcher dreistigkeit doping betrieben wird
6485205 das war das unfairste rennen meiner karriere dass so viele so schnell sind das kann eigentlich nicht sein

6485214 jeder sport kann gef hrlich werden und wenn man sich an die regeln und instruktionen h lt dann ist es glaube ich nicht gef hrlicher als etwas anderes
6485215 es gibt zwei gruppen die leute die relativ wenig flugerfahrung haben und vielleicht noch mehr an der ausbildung und ihrem k nnen arbeiten sollten und dann gibt es die gruppe die schon relativ gut ist und die flieger wollen dann noch mehr an ihre grenzen gehen
6485216 nat rlich kommt jugendlicher leichtsinn oft dazu vor allem wenn viele leute zusehen dann will man mehr zeigen genau da sollte man sich dann aber selbst an der nase nehmen denn dann ist es meist gef hrlicher und man sollte eigentlich einen gang zur ckschalten

6485220 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6485221 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels

6485229 its clear that michael phelps has found a place in the hearts of our members
6485230 in honor of his historic accomplishments match com would like to offer mr phelps a free membership until he finds that special someone even though we dont anticipate that hell be single for long
6485231 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6485232 if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
6485233 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6485234 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6485235 buying online has changed retail sites no longer make customers choose between convenience and price the current system puts ebay at a disadvantage
6485236 clearly theres a strong buyer preference for fixed price we love the auction model its still a great model for certain types of sales
6485237 i think the auction was a novelty at the beginning but now people want what they want when they want it

6485272 der letzte sektor hat es in sich da gibt es zwei passagen wo man die pobacken zusammenkneifen muss ich denke aber dass ich es schaffe trocken aus dem auto zu steigen

6485281 nachdem ich mein fahrrad abgestellt hatte sah ich berge von verletzten viele davon haben wir in fahrzeuge getragen danach wurden sie in die krankenh user gebracht dieses ganze gebiet hier war voller blut es war ein grauenhafter anblick
6485282 es war ungef hr 14 30 uhr und ich sa gerade in einem nahegelegenen hotel als ich die explosionen h rte alle rannten nach drau en berall flogen tr mmerteile durch die gegend menschen weinten und schrien und rannten orientierungslos umher
6485283 es kann schon sein dass die hinterm nner in den zerkl fteten bergregionen in den stammesgebieten von wasiristan sitzen aber die finden immer rekruten aus den dichter besiedelten gebieten das macht es extrem schwierig f r die sicherheitskr fte dieses netzwerk zu unterwandern
6485284 die haben jetzt angefangen unsere milit rorgane ins visier zu nehmen wir brauchen jetzt dringend eine politik f r die ganze nation schon aus selbstverteidigungsgr nden wir erkennen auch die handschrift des auslands in diesen barbarischen attacken
6485285 people dont buy a jacket trousers or a dress without trying it on so we thought wed try the same approach with cars
6485286 people on every coast in the world are our neighbors and we have to find ways to help them be prepared for what will come when storms hit
6485287 i worry that a lot of manufacturing capacity we could get back now we may not be able to get back in a couple of years
6485288 like a number of countries we do have reservations about aspects of the content of the draft exemption recently circulated
6485289 we would like to see these reservations given full and effective consideration so that we could have added confidence in the nonproliferation benefits an exemption might bring
6485290 the colorado education community has lost a thoughtful and inspiring leader
6485291 gerry difford was a passionate leader and dedicated educator who devoted his career to improving education across the state he worked in a variety of administrative positions but always kept the classroom in his heart we will miss his engaging smile easy going attitude and his genuine sense of purpose
6485292 if you were to look at america inc as a company its like owning a company and you own a smaller and smaller fraction of it so the fraction of america inc owned by americans is diminishing
6485293 because the focus right now is the weakness of the american economy and anything to keep our economy going is welcome
6485294 there will be less wealth left in the country to reinvest it in
6485295 it is the boards intention to recommend awards in fiscal year 2008 2009
6485296 you can see a lot of difference in the students faces
6485297 the students are good here without help but we see that our government cares about us its been a month and a half since they came to our school and asked what we needed and since then we have seen good progress
6485298 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children
6485299 this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6485300 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children
6485301 we dont have a lot of money but i see a bright future for schools in this area what matters most is the students are interested in studying and learning and the people here see the value in education
6485302 we are now in a fight against the great russia
6485303 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
6485304 georgian prime minister vladimer lado gurgenidze jewish made a special call to israel tuesday morning to receive a blessing from one of the haredi communitys most important rabbis and spiritual leaders rabbi aharon leib steinman
6485305 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
6485306 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
6485307 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
6485308 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
6485309 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
6485310 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
6485311 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
6485312 there are a few countries that will say told you so
6485313 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
6485314 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
6485315 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
6485316 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
6485317 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
6485318 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
6485319 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
6485320 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
6485321 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
6485322 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
6485323 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
6485324 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
6485325 this may not be a culmination but only step one
6485326 if you dont stop this kind of behaviour it escalates
6485327 we are just glad to be able to help and let the ia take the lead with the combined medical engagement
6485328 we are grateful for the efforts of the ia and friendly forces the supplies they have brought will be put to good use of the people of our neighborhood
6485329 any patient that comes here is treated for free and these medical supplies and support from the ia greatly helps the people who rely on us
6485330 people who have been limited on their water supply within the city will soon not have to worry about such issues
6485331 the pipeline attaches the al rasheed water treatment plant to the water tower in mahmudiyah in order to bring potable water to the city
6485332 this is a shared project between coalition forces and the iraqi government
6485333 the local water director came to us and identified demand for water in mahmudiyah as well as excess supply in al rasheed we provided the pipe and the goi is providing the funding for the installation testing and connection of the pipe everything but the pipe itself
6485334 the government of iraq did the technical piece of the project so that it was completed to their standards and their specifications
6485335 if you train and mentor young local leaders their individual accomplishments will instill confidence to build cities and neighborhoods without the assistance from coalition forces
6485336 some of them can see the writing on the wall others see it but they dont give a dam and others just dont see it all they can see is the almighty dollar you know its like i say it takes all kind of people to make up the world and its a case of whos going to be the strongest and whos going do the work whos gonna get it done but it must be done otherwise the whole world is will come to an end you know that my people lived with a balance of nature all those thousands of years before the white man and whenever they took something they always gave something and it worked out fine and the white man came along and he just took took took hes been taking all these hundreds of years now after all these hundreds of years now hes realizing that he gotta start putting back i mean hes working like hell to put it back but you got other people still taking the almighty dollar means everything to them they dont realize that the almighty dollar isnt going to be worth anything to them if theres no world to use it in

6485339 the retreat creates an opportunity for self reflection on what people want in their lives
6485340 people can see where they are and where they are going and make decisions about their lives
6485341 credo retreats are an investment the navy makes in its biggest asset sailors
6485342 we help people gain insight into personal problems and how to make changes in their lives
6485343 through attending the marriage retreat my husband and i discovered our personalities are very different and how this can create problems
6485344 we learned how to communicate more effectively and our marriage is stronger now

6485350 we remain skeptical about the agricultural theme and the various investment beneficiaries including seed company farm machinery producer and fertilizer equities
6485351 investors have been stung of late in farm equipment and fertilizer stocks but more pain could be coming even as raw material costs come down

6485353 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond

6485355 god looks at the hearts all that really matters to him is our intentions

6485357 one of more advanced pcb manufacturing methods is exposing laminate copper boards covered by photo resistive layer through mask using uv light in manufacturing pcb s has many benefits according to other methods you can get thin tracks like 0 2mm
6485358 the flyers we distribute help get the word out and advertise the small rewards program a lot better than soldiers going out and telling the people about it
6485359 these munitions getting taken off the street is a good thing
6485360 it means that they cant be used against us later on
6485361 the cooperation from everyone on the fob has led to us recovering more artillery than all of afghanistan combined

6485363 kami tidak pernah berpendapat olimpiade ini sekadar 16 hari penyelenggaraan spektakuler komite olimpiade internasional sendiri mengakui olimpiade beijing merupakan oimpiade terakhir dengan penampilan dan suasana sebesar ini
6485364 sebuah kesalahan jika berpikir olimpiade selanjutnya harus mencontoh olimpiade sebelumnya
6485365 hari hari mengabaikan stadion berkapasitas 90 000 telah berakhir khususnya di london london memiliki dua stadion serupa dengan stadion wembley yang baru kami harus menyediakan sesuatu bagi masyarakat setempat lebih dari sekadar menyombongkannya

6485377 i say right for it is a right an inestimable right that of invoking the penalties of the law upon those who criminally or feloniously attack our persons or our property civil society has deprived us of the natural right of avenging ourselves but it has preserved to us all the more jealously the right of bringing the offender to justice
6485378 to deprive a whole class of the community of this right to refuse their evidence and their sworn complaints is to brand them with a badge of slavery is to expose them to wanton insults and fiendish assaults is to leave their lives their families and their property unprotected by law it gives unrestricted license and impunity to vindictive outlaws and felons to rush upon these helpless people and kill and slay them at will as was done in this case

6485388 greater love has no man than this that he would lay down his life for his friends

6485420 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel
6485421 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6485422 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6485423 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6485424 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6485425 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6485426 it doesnt matter if you win or loose as long as we beat new zealand

6485437 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6485438 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6485439 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6485440 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6485441 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6485442 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6485443 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6485444 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6485445 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6485446 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
6485447 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
6485448 with an outstanding headlining performance at this years sold out summer breeze festival in germany the band impressed over 25 000 fans

6485450 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize

6485454 the poll shows how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
6485455 international crises such as iran or russia and the nation of georgia
6485456 whatever momentum obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost
6485457 its as if his campaign has stalled a little bit or coasted
6485458 for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6485459 were going to come out of our convention even more unified than we are right now ready to take on john mccain in the fall
6485460 i honestly dont feel that obama has been in politics long enough to be running our country
6485461 the hillary clinton campaign may be over but the clinton factor remains very much a part of the election
6485462 do we still have work to do with folks who supported hillary clinton absolutely but weve been able to make great strides
6485463 theyve already voted once against barack obama and right now after three months of 20 20 hindsight theyre still not voting for barack obama
6485464 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6485465 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6485466 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6485467 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6485468 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator

6485478 were growing up and we all have such huge dreams we want to fulfill but i would be on board to do a fourth movie definitely
6485479 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
6485480 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying
6485481 you make a movie with some people you become friends over the process of making this movie and then you go your own way
6485482 even by disney channel standards this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun
6485483 this was not a shooting that was a random act it was not random in nature
6485484 it is a terrible tragedy and it is a terrible tragedy that we work every minute and every day with our law enforcement partners to try and prevent
6485485 the feeling is hard to describe after all these years i never thought it would come down to this you give up hope
6485486 would say hi like nothing happened i wish i knew back then what i know today
6485487 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6485488 it would lessen the stress on local bars there would be judiciaries who could be dealing with real crimes it would be easier on the administration
6485489 i used to think the same way until i became a navy wife and saw the people i was saying should be allowed to drink
6485490 you volunteered to give your life im not volunteering to die at your hands because youre trashed and driving drunk
6485491 we have to teach our young ones that this is a responsibility that you have treat it with respect
6485492 here drinking seems to be the main theme of the party
6485493 if its in the open much of the allure is gone
6485494 i never thought it was cool to drink it was never an exciting or daring thing to do
6485495 i expect a lot out of myself im extremely disappointed with the way ive pitched and it was nice to throw a good game tonight we have a lot of big games ahead of us i hope down the stretch here we can get a lot of wins
6485496 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright

6485500 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections oliver friedrichs director of emerging technologies at symantecs security response unit said during a conference in las vegas earlier this year
6485501 more than likely the people who do this are the extremists or people who are in it for a profit campaigns need to become more aware of these kinds of attacks
6485502 campaigns are spending a lot on online advertising and some of this money is really being misspent and going to typo squatters
6485503 if i want to attack supporters of a particular campaign i can easily put malware on my site
6485504 you can target candidates cause confusion pop up ads or re direct computers when they try to log on to a candidates website

6485507 according to all the interim results that have been announced so far icbc has become the most profitable bank in the world in the first half of 2008
6485508 with the flooding and other damage brought on by tropical storm fay floridians need to be on the lookout for people who may try to profit from others misfortune
6485509 this is certainly no time to be trying to take advantage of storm victims
6485510 i thought of all my friends from one end of the country to the other and how they were really all in the same vast backyard doing something so frantic and rushing about
6485511 i didnt know who i was i was far away from home haunted and tired with travel in a cheap hotel room id never seen hearing the hiss of steam outside and the creak of the old wood of the hotel and footsteps upstairs and all the sad sounds and i looked at the cracked ceiling and really didnt know who i was for about fifteen strange seconds i wasnt scared i was just somebody else some stranger and my whole likfe was a haunted life the likfe of a ghost i was halfway across america at the dividing line between east of my youth and the west of my future and maybe thats why it happened right there and then that strange red afternoon

6485519 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
6485520 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6485521 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6485522 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6485523 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else

6485680 id be happier if i could read kindle books on my iphone 3g or my mac or if i could print individual pages or copy text into an e mail
6485681 but i figure that i get 99 percent of the potential enjoyment from just reading a book
6485682 i am being very patient all this time but i would like to warn them not to push me beyond the limit if i open my mouth on personal matters najib will be kept busy answering them for a very long time i have refrained from doing so as this is not a personal battle but about the political future of the country remember i too was in the government and i was privy to a lot of information najib knows what i know and he knows what i am talking about dont push me to respond or he will regret it
6485683 i am delighted its been on going all summer and its great that it is finally done and dusted
6485684 its been on and off for the past few months i kept hearing bits and pieces so its terrific that i have finally signed and now i can concentrate on the football
6485685 it was a difficult time because i was wondering if it was going to happen and that took its toll but thankfully everything is sorted out now
6485686 i thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season its a great club and im just glad to be part of it again and i look forward to playing for the club for the next four years
6485687 there have been a lot of new signings including my northern ireland team mate big kyle so they will add to the quality that is already here
6485688 kyle is still young and he is still learning but he has definitely got a bright future ahead of him and im sure he can be a big player for the club for many years to come
6485689 i firmly believe we have a really good group of players now and hopefully we will have a good season ahead
6485690 obviously its a blow that we dont have european football i was keeping an eye on the fixtures and it was disappointing when the lads went out
6485691 so it makes the league all the more important and hopefully we can concentrate on that and do well
6485692 in the short term the league has to be main target we will be fully focused on getting the title back
6485693 of course if we can do that then we will be back in europe next season and we can look at that then
6485694 missing out on the title on the final day last season was a big disappointment
6485695 we had a lot of games at the end of the season and it probably took its toll but it still didnt take away the disappointment given the position we were in
6485696 of course it was pittodrie where i played my last league game and that was the night when it went wrong for us
6485697 so hopefully if im involved on saturday it will be good to put that right and get the win we want
6485698 it was good to see the boys there was a bit of banter in the tunnel before the game but it worked out fine for everyone with the game finshing in a goal less draw

6485751 even as googles main expansion continues to shift outside the states with net international advertising revenues expected to rise by 51 2 in 2008 the us growth rate is far from a downturn

6485803 think to yourself do i need it for a checking account do i need it for a savings account am i looking to take a mortgage a car loan
6485804 are there minimum balance fees for the kind of account that you want
6485805 if its a checking account are there checking account fees and does that change depending on the number of checks you write if you are planning to use atm machines and planning to make deposits or withdrawals in atm machines are there fees that are charged
6485806 those fees can range anywhere from 30 to 40 and overdraft protection is often included as a courtesy but is a feature of the account a consumer needs to affirmatively opt out of
6485807 overdraft fees in the united states total billions of dollars so thats something consumers have to be aware of is that a feature that they think would be an advantage or a disadvantage

6485888 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6485889 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6485890 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6485891 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6485892 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6485893 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6485894 im a democrat why does obama choose an issue for which he is equally able to get clobbered as an issue to go after mccain i e how rich mccain is i could never live the mccain life style but then again i dont own a chicago mansion or vacation in million dollar hawaiin beach houses why cant the democrats get smart about this election
6485895 obamas argument that he understand the economy better and that the republican candidate doesnt get it
6485896 do you really want mccain gramm and fiorina running the economy
6485897 heres the difference amnesty john and his wife paid for their homes with their own money
6485898 eating argula is more elitist than owing 7 homes youve got to be kidding
6485899 how many homes does ted kennedy own or does he shop at wal mart who cares world war 111 may be looming get the guy with experience and worldwide respect in the office that isnt obama

6485901 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6485902 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6485903 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6485904 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6485905 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6485906 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6485907 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6485908 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6485909 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6485910 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6485911 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6485912 on any given night its a matter of the little things
6485913 and tonight we just couldnt buy a hit when we needed to the reality is japan was the better team tonight
6485914 we felt like we were on them all game long it was only going to take an inning or two to make something happen
6485915 we just couldnt get that big hit we got people in scoring position we did our job that way and then we just couldnt capitalize
6485916 im not every hitter i know at the plate we struggled our pitching wasnt quite on point like it has been but you know what we came out and gave it everything we had
6485917 and how well we beat teams but the way this game works the way this sport works you never know any given day any team can beat anybody
6485918 ive really got to tip my hat to yukiko ueno she pitched a hell of a last two days and they beat us
6485919 id take away two pitches if i could the double and the home run
6485920 they were the only two balls they really hit solid and they did that at the right time
6485921 i felt good i got going strong early on obviously
6485922 where in previous games its taken me a while to get going so i felt really good

6485948 can spam is not a strict liability statute there has to be intent for a violation to occur
6485949 affiliates are non agent independent contractors img has no control over them
6485950 because of the current administration everyone within the federal bureaucracy has been empowered to incredible arrogance theyve been encouraged to believe theyre right whether or not they are the jury told the government the people are tired of the status quo and frequent strong arm tactics like peter finch in network they said were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore but the prosecution refused to accept that
6485951 the government tried to make the case about adult but the jury didnt care
6485952 in its post trial filings the government argues that imgs provision of marketing materials to purecash one of imgs affiliates for use in commercial electronic mail messages justifies the entry of the proposed injunctive order
6485953 purecash did not send any of the 413 messages captured and used as evidence at trial
6485954 the argument seems to be that img knew or must have known that materials provided to purecash would make their way to imatrix and that img therefore initiated the five messages sent by imatrix
6485955 t he jury has already concluded that img did not initiate these five messages even if the court reweighs the evidence in light of plaintiffs post trial submissions the link between purecash and imatrix is so tenuous that it does not support a finding that img intentionally paid or induced imatrix to transmit the electronic mail messages at issue
6485956 the government has failed to show that img violated the can spam act of 2003
6485957 after listening to the evidence presented at trial the jury found that img had not initiated any of the 413 commercial electronic mail messages at issue in this case despite ample warning that defendant intended to challenge every assumption on which the governments claims were based plaintiff failed to provide evidence from which the tech savvy jury could conclude that img had procured the transmission of violative messages the court declines to second guess or otherwise alter the jurys findings
6485958 what the government set out to do it actually accomplished producers have gotten much tougher on their affiliates
6485959 backed off on further prosecutions under can spam prosecutions came to a screeching halt very quietly but they came to a screeching halt hopefully this case has called off the willy nilly institution of claims against all producers for the acts of affiliates
6485960 this was a proper and intellectually honest decision on the part of the court wholly supported by the facts and the decision of the jury
6485961 there was no error committed by the court that would prejudice the case against the government

6485969 i had a frantic mother come to me the other day in tears
6485970 she told me that her son timothy invited several of his friends over into his bedroom for private prayer and devotional scripture studies what she told me next is enough to of every god fearing mother and father in our christian nation satan is in our midst my friends the devil is using volleyball to lure young men into shedding their clothes flopping around and falling off off their beds with him into the pit of iniquity lucifer is turning innocent afternoon gatherings of imprecatory prayer into frenzied young masturbating baptist boys clubs
6485971 heard not the sacred sounds of scripture readings accompanied by soft sweet whispers to our heavenly father but rather a noisy television set spewing tuned to an olympic volleyball match
6485972 timothys head was peeking out from under the pimpled rump of his prayer leader
6485973 they were all on the bedroom floor covered in sweat their stiffened purple tallywhackers pointing in every direction
6485974 when church security officers arrived on the scene the boys had dressed themselves and were seated quietly in the living room each with an open bible on their lap
6485975 but the devil didnt clean up his mess in the bedroom no sir his tell tale hoof prints were everywhere there were empty bottles of secular lubricant four pairs of silk panties stained with the after lust of lucifers business and what appeared to be a horse harness stuffed into timothys closet along with a case of in addition security officers reported the boys had been playing with superheroes except for jesus is forbidden in this church officer wilkins told me he found a tantus ball toy and titanmen training tools under timothys bed and were looking into it because there are bound to be some some sticky giant gold rings found under timothys dresser are also suspect because the boy is probably into the fantasy book series the and well have none of that there is also the possibility the boys were worshipping an idol because officer wilkins found a sinister looking black silicone graven image with a bulbous head and nylon straps had been thrown out of timothys window im told the tip of the idol family dog had gotten hold of it
6485976 i have no doubt in my mind that all across america christian families are coming across scenes exactly like this
6485977 we wont stand for it in this church from this day forward any member of our congregation caught watching olympic volleyball or even mentioning olympic volleyball will be asked to pack their belongings and find a place to live where your filthy sinful disgusting is accepted
6485978 obstruction of justice is a serious charge we have taken note of it and referred the matter to the partys disciplinary action committee

6485980 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6485981 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective

6485984 down there is where you develop up here its a pennant race if you ask if the decision was right id say it was
6485985 thats why i had insisted on abuse here in liberia personally
6485986 is feel strongly that even one allegation or by welcoming the notion that the number of allegations reported have come down i am also seriously concerned about the possibility of underreporting

6485999 weve spent a lot of time working on the story this time weve worked with people from hollywood script writers to really make it just right and i think its a very unusual story for a videogame so i think people will be quite surprised
6486000 this is something its really too early to talk about but its definitely a possibility
6486001 theres so many possibilities with this thing because what matters now is just the story you want to tell do you have a good story to tell then you can do it because this thing isnt specific to the series you can tell any story with this interface because its entirely contextual

6486029 if tom biscardi files a police report in menlo park it would originate with san mateo county
6486030 but it sounds like santa clara as well as counties in georgia and indiana could also get involved

6486092 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6486093 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6486094 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6486095 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi

6486106 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6486107 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year

6486199 for example over 78 percent of the subjects were concomitantly taking beta blockers and over 88 percent were taking statins amongst other medical interventions and treatments
6486200 we have no way of knowing from reading the study whether these interventions were continued through the lifecycle of the study which could significantly influence the outcomes
6486201 researchers realize there is debate over homocysteine hcy level as a marker for existing cardiovascular disease cvd or a predictor of cvd randomized clinical trials are currently testing whether lowering hcy levels through supplementation with b vitamins will reduce cvd
6486202 we know for certain is that there are significant populations of older people with cvd who have moderately low concentrations of serum
6486203 applying some degree of common sense there is a plausible link that needs to be investigated further it is important however that these findings not become generalized applied and reported to be related to a healthy population that may be responsibly supplementing with b vitamins and the preventative benefits they may derive
6486204 a study such as this is in no way conclusive and should not be represented as such or be used in any way to stop those who may currently benefit from taking b vitamins from continuing their regimens the overwhelming body of research shows that poor nutrition is much more of a health risk than using optimal levels of b vitamin supplementation in a balanced diet exercise and health regimen
6486205 this study like other similarly designed studies fails to answer the question of whether b vitamin supplementation over the long term can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in a population that is healthy at baseline
6486206 its important to remember that there is a large body of observational data that suggests that higher b vitamin intake and lower homocysteine levels are both associated with lower cvd risk which is consistent with how vitamins are intended to be used as a preventive measure rather than as a treatment to already existing disease
6486207 the agreement is further proof that major organisations appreciate the value of our products particularly in the area of child health
6486208 these products are based on many years of research proving good clinical results the safety demands are naturally very high for this type of product our safety data has been a strong factor in facilitating the agreement with nestl
6486209 what we are now seeing in the form sales and earnings growth is the fruit of a long term focus on r amp d and product development and that we have a well functioning business model our market is growing fast and our own brand is gaining increasingly widespread recognition we anticipate continued strong sales development

6486213 is dietary knowledge enough hunger stress and other roadblocks to healthy eating
6486214 when individuals extend the interval between meals or consume more of their food away from home they are significantly more likely to consume more calories and more calories from solid fats alcohol and added sugars discretionary calories at each eating occasion
6486215 for example going five hours between meals instead of four adds about 52 calories for someone on a diet of 2 000 calories per day extending that interval from four to six hours would add about 91 calories to the meal going longer stretches between meals is also estimated to lower diet quality at each meal
6486216 making specific reference to such situations and suggesting ways to mitigate their effects should enhance the usefulness of educational campaigns designed to improve diet quality
6486217 limiting intake of foods prepared away from home is also estimated to significantly decrease caloric consumption thus another possibility would be to encourage individuals to plan ahead or seek out information about nutrient and caloric content of foods prepared away from home

6486230 computer programs for deleting search history after accessing web sites
6486231 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6486232 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6486233 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose
6486234 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to web sites

6486236 i think as labour costs rise in china and theres a price to pay for pollution that we will see manufacturing coming to india
6486237 theres been for some time a sense that agriculture can no longer absorb any more people
6486238 india has become a net exporter of fdi foreign direct investment thats because it is too difficult to start up labour intensive manufacturing of the kind you find in china sixty percent of indians depend on agriculture and i dont see that changing
6486239 the hardware estimate seems optimistic the auto industry seems in the right area
6486240 the important question here is what kind of jobs are created in the past it has been low security and low paid jobs in what is called the informal sector that needs to change

6486263 the reality is he gowdiak has done a significant amount of research and clearly its understandable he wants to find a way to monetize that
6486264 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
6486265 this isnt something someone in a garage is going to be able to sort out in an afternoon hes gowdiaks clearly a smart guy
6486266 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6486267 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6486268 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6486269 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6486270 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6486271 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6486272 we all are really happy to receive such response from our audience the hard work has really paid off
6486273 though ratings given by trade analysts and media count the verdict given by the audience is more important their appreciation motivates us to come up with new package of innovative ideas
6486274 our expectations and its time to celebrate its success we have proved ourselves by connecting with the audiences
6486275 the masses have related themselves to the characters though my role was small but small things comes in good packages

6486279 and to help lewis all i can say is that i dont think he needs any help to be honest
6486280 i think he can be strong enough to win races for himself certainly i am not planning to help him if i have the chance to win i will go for it i am still trying to improve my position in the championship and that is also the message from the team i dont need to help anyone
6486281 the bottom line is that he doesnt need any help he is strong enough to do it for himself
6486282 i didnt feel that i had a monkey on my back at any point i didnt get stressed about it
6486283 it was going to happen and it was just a matter of time in my opinion
6486284 in that way i dont feel that it has made a big difference in terms of feeling easier it is just the same
6486285 i feel i am driving better and i am feeling easier in the car i am working well with the engineers
6486286 the whole package has come on a long way and i need to carry on this trend
6486287 well of course it was a great feeling to win a grand prix and i think the last few races realistically i have targeted the victory i feel i am ready for achieving that and to achieve that was a good feeling
6486288 now it is back to basics starting all over again we will try to repeat it and every time try to maximise the points from the weekend
6486289 no i didnt have a big party i got back home on the same evening and i went to do some fitness tests at the beginning of the holiday and then spent some time with my family and friends but no big party to celebrate the victory just a coffee with my family including my grandmother and grandfather that was all
6486290 yes but like i said it is something i have been targeting for a long time it is just part of the target now we need to raise the bar and try and repeat it again it is really not such a big deal
6486291 obviously a new circuit it is a little bit tricky to build big expectations because you dont know what it is going to be like its a street circuit and the only thing we know is how it is in monte carlo this has very different characteristics it has longer straights and more high speed corners all we can do is walk around the track we tried it in the simulator back in woking as well and the most important thing is to go out tomorrow and see how it goes
6486292 yeah it looks exciting pretty cool im looking forward to driving it there are some very difficult sections and some bits that are hard on the brakes and the high speed corners are going to be interesting
6486293 i try to approach it like i always approach the street circuits it is going to be very green so maybe less attack than what you would do on a normal road course then i will just try and build it up so the last run in qualifying is maximum attack
6486294 no no particular corners that i am worried about they are all challenging and all are difficult with some hard braking where there is a lot of time to be had the last sector has a lot of high speed changes of direction and the braking into the last two corners is quite tricky you need to brake while changing direction so it will be quite difficult and quite easy to spoil a good lap right at the end of it
6486295 i walked around the track today and i thought it looked alright to be honest i saw a road car going past me while i was there and it looked like it didnt do anything to it obviously for us it will be a bit of a bigger effect but i dont think it will be a big problem
6486296 if it happened that i now won 20 races in a row it would be pretty cool i think pretty extraordinary i dont feel that i have changed but now like i said i have been targeting this victory for the last couple of months and we could have done it before
6486297 all the ingredients were there to make it happen and i dont really need to worry about when it was going to happen now i just have to try and repeat it again
6486298 i didnt feel that i had a monkey on my back at any point i didnt get stressed about it it was going to happen and it was just a matter of time in my opinion in that way i dont feel that it has made a big difference in terms of feeling easier it is just the same
6486299 a little bit i certainly feel stronger in every area i feel i am driving better im feeling easier in the car im working well with the engineers the whole package has come on a long way and i need to carry on this trend and eventually it will be good
6486300 yes i think i am learning all the time i m expecting to improve the results from now on hopefully we dont get any set backs like we had earlier this year hopefully we can get a good trend now and hopefully we can maximise the points each weekend without any incidents that would be good
6486301 i think they are both strong i dont know which one is stronger
6486302 no i was surprised that his start was so good even compared to lewis but apart from that no he is a fighter and going into the first corner if you have a chance to take the lead then all the drivers in a top car will always have a go it worked for him this time and i wasnt surprised
6486303 yeah i think so he has won grands prix this year and he came back after a difficult start to the season so i dont see why not i think he has as good a chance as anyone there at the top
6486304 i am happy to work all the time with my engineers
6486305 so i feel 100 per cent commitment from the team not only from the managers but also from the engineers the mechanics and everyone back in woking also from mercedes benz i feel very happy here i enjoy working here i can say what i think and i can improve i feel i am improving all the time
6486306 the desire to win more grands prix is 100 per cent

6486313 social media has grown into an essential part of every companys online marketing mix
6486314 savvy business owners understand that social media is critical to their brands identity because this new medium has torn down the wall that used to stand between a company and its customers
6486315 what our clients needed was a way to protect their brands on social media
6486316 the only way to do that is to enact a 1 on 1 dialogue with their customers rather than re acting to blog posts and other feedback that comes out of nowhere
6486317 viewing social media through the lens of return on investment misses the point
6486318 nobody has cracked the code for monetizing social media but theres a cost involved with not getting active you lose existing customers and miss out on potential customers when you dont open your brand to social media

6486338 how do you define out of touch there are a lot of people in florida who have lost or are in danger of losing their only home unlike john mccain they dont have the luxury of forgetting how many homes they have
6486339 coming from someone whose economic adviser believes america is just a nation of whiners it really makes you wonder whether john mccain has any understanding of the challenges regular folks are facing when he owns so many homes that he cant even remember how many
6486340 yesterday john mccain couldnt remember how many homes he owns because he has so many the obama campaign is trying to find floridians who like mccain have lost track of the number of homes they own do you know how many homes you own

6486378 instead of burying more carbon youll bury less than if you didnt have the increased carbon inputs
6486379 this is a very important piece of evidence if we try to understand what will happen in the future

6486416 our goal is to have the same ui on both linux and symbian and the qt platform lets us move forward toward that with its cross platform technology
6486417 perhaps this is an open admission that the pressure from the linux industry is really forcing nokia and symbian to change their game
6486418 questions remain as to whether the solution will be truly open and what the cost of a foundation membership will be
6486419 but one thing is for sure it is refreshing to see nokia showing real agility and vision and it will change the landscape significantly
6486420 has the potential to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to pre industrial levels
6486421 the process works by thermally decomposing calcining limestone and adding the resulting calcium oxide to seawater thereby increasing the capacity of the oceans to act as a carbon sink whilst at the same time mitigating ocean acidification the carbon dioxide generated by the thermal decomposition calcination of limestone can be sequestered or utilized either as the starting point for the production of fuels or to enable biomass to be grown in arid environments without the need for irrigation the process thus addresses a number of environmental and social problems climate change ocean acidification food shortages fuel shortages water shortages and soil salinification from excessive irrigation
6486422 first you heat limestone to a very high temperature until it breaks down into lime and carbon dioxide then you put the lime into the sea where it reacts with carbon dioxide dissolved in the seawater the important point is that when you put lime into seawater it absorbs almost twice as much carbon dioxide as is produced by the breaking down of the limestone in the first place this has the effect of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it also helps to prevent ocean acidification another problem caused by the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
6486423 at which point it should be possible to determine whether the concept merits further investigation
6486424 there are no patents involved in this process and that is the way we want to keep it we are opening it up to everyone so that we can draw on the expertise of people who can help us to transform the idea from concept to reality by posting any ideas or suggestions onto this website you will be publicly disclosing that information which will create a broad anti patent space this will prevent anyone from gaining a patent that could restrict the development of this process every contribution will be logged and date stamped creating a permanent record which can be used to challenge anyone trying to gain patents in this area by using an open source approach no one can restrict anyone else from developing this process open source has been successfully used to develop wikipedia and software such as linux as far as we are aware this is the first time it has been used to try to tackle an issue such as climate change
6486425 we know that it works in theory we need to understand how we can make it work in practice

6486427 the market for outdoor gps solutions is finally moving beyond the stage of a niche early adopter market
6486428 the use of advanced handheld outdoor gps devices recently launched by garmin magellan delorme and bushnell requires only limited specialist knowledge compared to their predecessors
6486429 the availability price and quality of topographical maps are major issues especially in europe distribution and communication is still mainly limited to specialized outdoor retailers and magazines and many of the recently launched solutions suffer from performance and reliability issues
6486430 maemo is already in this space thanks to the patronage of nokia moblin will benefit from tight integration with atom and intels drive and limo is actively being positioned for this market the flexibility customization and very positive cost comparison to windows mobile looks set to ensure that linux takes the leading role in this market
6486431 the whole thing is truly compact it could be put in a cell phone and it can use just sunlight for illumination which makes it very appealing for third world applications

6486433 our research is motivated by the fact that microscopes have been around since the 16th century and yet their basic design has undergone very little change and has proven prohibitively expensive to miniaturize
6486434 our new design operates on a different principle and allows us to do away with lenses and bulky optical elements
6486435 a layer of metal is coated onto a grid of charge coupled device ccd sensor the same sensors that are used in digital cameras then a line of tiny holes less than one millionth of a meter in diameter is punched into the metal spaced five micrometers apart each hole corresponds to one pixel on the sensor array a microfluidic channel through which the liquid containing the sample to be analyzed will flow is added on top of the metal and sensor array the entire chip is illuminated from above sunlight is sufficient internal structure of the optofluidic microscope when the sample is added it flows either by the simple force of gravity or drawn by an electric charge horizontally across the line of holes in the metal as cells or small organisms cross over the holes one hole after another the objects block the passage of light from above onto the sensor below this produces a series of images consisting of light and shadow akin to the output of a pinhole camera because the holes are slightly skewed so that they create a diagonal line with respect to the direction of flow the images overlap slightly all of the images are then pieced together to create a surprisingly precise two dimensional picture of the object

6486537 they were promised the future of mobile phones but many owners of apples iphone 3g say the only future they have seen since its july 11th debut is a series of problems and software updates
6486538 it basically does everything i want it to do except for sometimes it doesnt it will open up give me a title page or splash card for a couple of seconds and then itll just go back to the home screen
6486539 were here in the heart of the financial district and i dont even have 3g connectivity so its kind of a bummer
6486540 its frozen quite a few times and ive only had it for two weeks its a little bit annoying
6486541 which could mean the headaches for some iphone 3g users arent going away anytime soon
6486542 its just kind of crapping out all the time before the update on monday it wasnt really getting calls very well it was dropping calls all the time then i updated on monday and now the calls function works fine but im having a lot of problems with the application and the internet browsing function so its really wonky these days its not very dependable
6486543 we have to remember that when 3g was launched in europe a couple of years ago they had very similar problems so we shouldnt blame this only on apple its a brand new network its a brand new technology gonna have a bunch of 3g phones really soon theyre rolling out their 3g network so were gonna see problems with this across the board because 3gs very new to us
6486544 thats my deadline if its not working by halloween im gonna go back to my blackberry but i think we should have some patience either that or maybe ill just write the word sucker across my forehead because i have faith in the iphone
6486545 some of the last generation nanos have been overheating and giving their owners minor burns so its not just spontaneous combustion where its going to light on fire and your hair catches on fire something like that but it will overheat from time to time and then you get some burns but this is the last generation nano the one they sold about two years ago the current generation of nanos hasnt had any problems reported
6486546 all gadgets are prone to overheating like that computers laptops things like that we should expect that pretty much all gadgets may overheat
6486547 there are things you can do you can run your battery for the full lifecycle of your gadgets battery life and never ever ever buy a counterfeit battery ever because those are prone to explode
6486548 it was like wait a second being in a bands rubbish what you make a record and then tour for two years and the best reaction you can get is 2 000 people going yeah i know this song thats not what i find satisfying about music
6486549 they werent even thinking about success in the first place
6486550 they really dont give a shit about selling records at all i know its a cliche but it really is all about the music
6486551 when they did that second album which is radically different from the first one it was like this hasnt got their breakthrough cover version of hounds of love on any more so theyre not very good i mean i love the album it sounds great
6486552 i love being associated with the futureheads theyre my mates but when you start to see reviews where its like shiny happy popsters from sunderland field music i think what who us
6486553 the people who are into field music in america are the most ardent anglophiles
6486554 but now with school of language its like i love avant jazz combo chicago underground duo and i love post rock act tortoise and yeah the school of language album is pretty cool its very different
6486555 we realised quite a long time ago lets not fight to get on the front cover of the nme
6486556 if we just keep making things of quality maybe theyll take 20 years but people will find us and if that means theres never any huge breakthrough then so be it

6486562 when you mention vic godard everybody still goes who only the real cognoscenti know who he is i first met him when i was stood outside the lyceum in edinburgh he was playing with subway sect along with the slits and the jam but subway sect were my favourites i asked if i could carry his gear in i didnt meet him again until 1991 or 1992 geoff travis put us together and i produced vics album end of the surrey people paul cook was his drummer by then and he was a bit cagy a bit protective he thought i was taking the piss
6486563 i was on the same episode of later as they were but i missed them because i was too nervous i heard their album a little while later and loved it the way theyre hairy rough looking middle americans but they sing nobodys gonna love you more they could do well on american country stations but their sound doesnt really slot in there either i saw them at shepherds bush empire they played three encores and people went shhhh in the quiet bits i think that qualifies them as a cult band
6486564 he is the cult heros cult hero especially for the big star albums the third is his masterpiece there are no rules on it none at all most albums have some kind of theme but this is as disjointed as music gets and somehow its sublime hes gone on to influence other cult heroes like the cocteau twins and jeff buckley would i like to meet him yeah we could have a chat over a bottle of white wine but id like to know what kind of mood hed be in first
6486565 skip spence was the drummer for jefferson airplane before he became the singer guitarist and leading light of moby grape his contributions to their first three albums were marked by a wild logic rare even in those extreme times just listen to omaha indifference motorcycle irene or seeing the last is just like syd barretts scream thy last scream being a tone poem of madness and despair institutionalised in new yorks bellevue hospital after a violent episode he travelled to nashville at the end of 1968 to record his masterpiece oar he looked brilliant the cover is one of the most iconic pictures of the period spence died in 1999 leaving a 90 minute or so legacy of some of the most extreme psychedelic music ever made

6486572 the zensah leg sleeve could speed up your performance and reduce recovery time according to research and runner reports compression sleeves improve performance of the most important muscle for running the calf muscle the zensah leg sleeve is the only calf sleeve which incorporates pin point compression to the calf area i recommend it for use when traveling on flights to and from a marathon
6486573 our compression clothing has a more ergonomic fit has specially engineered compression zones and is far more comfortable than any other compression clothing on the market
6486574 we allow athletes to focus on their training and competition not on their clothing
6486575 there is no question that with the success of olympic athletes it will raise the awareness of the benefits of compression clothing we believe that zensah will benefit greatly since our technology is superior athletes always are looking for that edge and zensah has that qualitative advantage

6486586 communication technologies possess a power that has proven mightier than physical weaponry

6486637 among other things you need to plan on how to not become aol
6486638 for now its a great test and its not easy to do by any means
6486639 but we are working and learning to see how we can implement the same sort of approach in different genres personally i think it can fit in many different games
6486640 if you use ten buttons for a game it will be difficult for the more casual gamers
6486641 so we are looking at how you can use the camera and also accelerometers weve seen a lot of that happening lately on apples side and we think its going to be something interesting that will take games in new directions
6486642 its good to have a market where there is more talk about mobile games and where a lot of it is about different companies
6486643 thats a good thing for all of us as it elevates the whole topic in the minds of consumers
6486644 of course for first party we are more keen on the platform and we have built up a lot of experience with our developers
6486645 but if we can pull together something great like reset generation and put it in the marketplace others will look at it and say how can we do that it wont take too long to get those learnings across the publishers and developers i dont see the gap as a problem in the longer term

6486669 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6486670 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6486671 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6486672 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6486678 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6486679 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6486680 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6486681 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6486682 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6486683 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6486684 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6486685 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6486686 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6486687 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6486688 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

6486690 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6486691 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6486692 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6486693 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6486694 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6486695 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

6486697 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6486698 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6486699 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6486701 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6486702 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6486703 in the r rated tony award winning broadway puppet show avenue q there are some characters call the bad idea bears these cute snuggly care bearish tempters give the other characters really awful advice like to drink five long island iced teas on a work night or to hook up with the neighborhood slut to get back at your girlfriend the bad idea bears create all sorts of plot twists when their absurd advice backfires in the foobiverse there are bad idea foobs that are always whispering atrocious suggestions to the pattersons the only problem is that when a foob follows the most ludicrous course of action imaginable everything comes up roses
6486704 unfortunately for closet cases in the great white north they cant claim to have an imaginary girlfriend in canada they have to dupe a fake one
6486705 to paraphrase roger ebert lynn has heard that better authors sometimes use bridal nerves as a dramatic device to generation tension she just hasnt learned why so the smooth ride foreshadowing pays off with a mere burst of neurotic bridezillaism the fob who theoretically could be carrying a weighty secret really has nothing at all on his mind but lame lost the ring gags and we learn that in a few short years young francie will be saving frantically to run away and join april at the commune in vancouver

6486738 john mccain has been a leader and a friend to sportsmen and gun owners for over 25 years

6486763 g2 men on a mission in a rundown suburb of washington dc a group of anti iraq war protesters has set up home but they are no ordinary activists they are all veterans of the conflict daniel nasaw talks to them
6486764 people who have been part of a war that i consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it
6486765 they command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of whats actually happening on the ground generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than congress members who are against the war
6486766 when youre coming out of the military the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit

6486774 they let me flare up like that and they gave me that space and then as i naturally came down of that i was able to say im sorry i was not thinking naturally
6486775 if i have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides hes not going to join the military thats a direct action
6486776 a war resister inside the military is both but that doesnt necessarily make it more effective i would rather have 1 000 high school students who would otherwise not join than one person within the military resist thats taking 1 000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out
6486777 im kind of an anxious person im kind of antsy i have a lot of quirks that make people uncomfortable but being around cats like this its second nature nobody really notices it

6486913 if you look particularly at new mexico colorado and nevada those are probably the top three states where democrats have made huge gains

6486941 national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term

6486951 iraqs chief negotiator mohammed al haj hamoud told reuters a draft of the agreement was complete and would be presented to iraqi political leaders to approve and send to parliament he said the draft did not include withdrawal dates
6486952 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement

6486961 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation

6487090 stargate sg1 was not picked up for a sixth season by the sci fi channel but will live on in a two hour movie that will air some time in 2008 on sci fi
6487091 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas
6487092 the successes of the two original stargate direct to video movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
6487093 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6487094 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6487095 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6487096 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces

6487099 whether its a different group of pirates we cant tell until an investigation is carried out we have sent out an urgent warning to all ships travelling through the gulf of aden
6487100 we want to pressure the united nations and the international community to do something about it to take steps to stop this menace
6487101 without un intervention we cant do anything because somalia has no central government
6487102 she took this money to pay her mortgage to pay her credit card bills
6487103 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6487104 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6487105 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6487106 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts

6487108 madonna may have turned 50 but shes still as big a draw to cybercriminals as young hollywood upstarts like bad girl britney spears paris hilton and lindsay lohan
6487109 with the new world tour just around the corner its not surprising that the hackers are trying to capitalise on this using topical stories is one of the oldest tricks in the book and the danger is that fans of the material girl will click before they think
6487110 its the heaviest of users that are directly contributing to the degradation of the service for the other people on the network
6487111 its an interesting reflection on the claim that there is a free market for broadband
6487112 if there was competition could you slow down your best customers
6487113 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details
6487114 what does ebs enable in short traditional processing on large datasets and reliable storage for many servers
6487115 many other applications that require running a file system or access to raw block level storage
6487116 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6487117 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6487118 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6487119 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6487120 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6487121 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6487122 were going in and were going to take care of this for these guys
6487123 but now the army appears to have retaliated against the army social services official chuck roeder who first reported the poor conditions at fort sill and their neglect to the media

6487137 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
6487138 this isnt something someone in a garage is going to be able to sort out in an afternoon hes gowdiaks clearly a smart guy
6487139 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6487140 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6487141 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
6487142 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6487143 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6487144 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6487145 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
6487146 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups
6487147 abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me

6487162 this breakdown of the peace process is not caused by the milf we have been very consistent we have been very observing the cease fire but in spite of all of this the government does not honor its commitments
6487163 its in tatters its in tatters i dont know how to pick up the pieces
6487164 i think things look really grim at the moment i think theres a good chance that it will be a while and i mean years before we can get back to where we were before the court order stopped the agreement from being implemented
6487165 but i think as well there are real questions about whether either party negotiating the agreement did enough work with its own constituents
6487166 theres been some fairly bellicose statements coming out of the armed forces
6487167 i think probably both sides would prefer not to have to go back to conflict but what was holding hostilities back was the prospect that peace was at least if not around the corner on the horizon and now its a big question mark

6487177 the premium hall will address quality of fresh produce through cold chain management essentially the establishment of the premium hall at a cost of r250 million is intended to position the jfpm as a leading role player in the south african fresh produce industry
6487178 produce will enter the premium hall directly from refrigerated trucks through docking stations with the assistance of dock levellers to prevent an interruption of the cold chain produce coming from smaller and emerging farmers who do not have cooling facilities will go into rapid cooling units first to bring the temperatures as quickly as possible to the right levels this will enable smaller farmers to compete on an equal footing with the large producers
6487179 the premium hall is designed to attract a significant amount of new business to the jfpm the informal traders will still be able to buy produce from us at the same price as the large retailers the premium hall is for everyone who needs quality fresh produce
6487180 also the deregulation of fresh produce distribution post 1994 saw farmers getting leeway to sell directly to large retailers the emergence of food safety standards also saw retailers divorcing themselves from the fresh produce market leading to losses
6487181 dialogue was initiated between the alternative market group and the jfpm management with a view to engineering a solution that would advance the business interests of both parties
6487182 the fruit and the potato and onion halls fall within these plans there are options to set up value adding activities like sorting and packing operations retail group depots and possibly a meat and or fish market in this area

6487214 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6487215 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6487216 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

6487411 whats becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
6487412 its just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
6487413 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
6487414 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look heres some human faeces
6487415 and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
6487416 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
6487417 and once they start using a toilet even if its just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder

6487460 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6487461 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6487462 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6487463 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6487464 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6487465 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6487466 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6487467 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6487468 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again

6487532 the problem with being a node on the net today is that youve got to have a captive technical specialist we have chris davis around for the care and feeding of the balky beast we couldnt do it ourselves
6487533 so one direction in which technology has to evolve is much more standardized units that a non technical person can feel comfortable with its the same shift as from minicomputers to pcs i can see a future in which any person can have a node on the net any person can be a publisher its better than the media we now have its possible were working actively
6487534 you go tell a hardware internet hacker that everyone should have a node on the net
6487535 and the first thing theyre going to say is ip doesnt scale
6487536 is evolve the protocol get the smart people together and figure out what to do do we add id do we add new protocol dont just say we cant do it

6487548 he pitched extremely well for us it was very impressive we need that type of effort going forward
6487549 for him to come back and hopefully do this for us is going to be nice
6487550 he pitched great hopefully hell do it the rest of the season hopefully we can get him back next year and he can do it the whole year

6487555 there were about ten people with two ministry vehicles around the dead animal busy chopping and cutting it up our path was going right past the carcass but the men asked us to make a small detour which we could not because of very thick sand so we were forced to drive through and over the blood and guts strewn over the path this is not a nice experience for any tourist

6487568 hes had some great games this year but i think at a certain point in time that was the best sinker weve seen all year
6487569 he may be the only starter in the game that could literally throw one pitch and win 20 games every year
6487570 you dont really expect to score a lot of runs against one of the games best pitchers
6487571 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
6487572 given the figures that we have just received this morning last friday we can safely say that our new born baby has emerged the biggest travel and tourism fair in the continent in terms of space bookings up from position five
6487573 this marks a difference of almost 3 000 square metres from south africas indaba traditionally ranked the biggest which booked around 5 500 square metres this year
6487574 the biotechnology revolution has been just that a revolution it has presented pharmaceutical companies with so many promising targets and opportunities for innovation that identifying the best candidates is costly and results in many blind alleys translating new discoveries into marketable products has taken the industry longer than expected breakthroughs such as genomics remain vital sources of innovation but the new products are in large part still to be developed

6487587 weve had it for a little bit and australia have taken it back
6487588 it has been because of the success weve had around the world for the past couple of years its reward for that and we really want to improve our game
6487589 i would like to think if we had been playing a fair amount of one day cricket coming into the series everything would roll smoothly
6487590 our battle is to get into the series in the first couple of games to get our standards up to the level we know we are capable of
6487591 we are pretty undercooked considering the cricket we have played we are favourites in terms of what we have achieved over a period of time and that is fair enough
6487592 but as a team our feet are firmly on the ground in terms of what we need to do to be successful here

6487635 it is a decision taken by the entire membership and we do not expect anyone to go against it well reverse the decision when the bills are settled

6487637 we are very pleased with summer 2008 and now more than ever it so important for a pr firm to drive results not talk

6487641 illegal operations and increased activity by mobile operators especially in the northern protected areas are still a concern as a result the tourism board has found it necessary to appoint a task force to look into the matter and this has led to a temporary moratorium on the issuance of mobile operator licences
6487642 the drive to diversify the tourism product base and to present tourists with a wide range of products activities experiences and interactions is on as a ministry we recognise and respect the important roles played by government private sector and local communities and as such we will strive to ensure that the tourism sector is government led private sector driven and there is active participation by local communities the starting point is to have local communities benefit directly from the industry by being part of it
6487643 we are going to do it soon and we are already looking at various names that have been forwarded by the relevant bodies
6487644 memorandum of mutual undertaking on the establishment of a flag carrier between the government of the federal republic of nigeria and virgin atlantic limited virgin airways limited
6487645 the airline will be allowed to use the relevant international terminals in nigerian airports including murtala mohammed airport lagos and nnamdi azikiwe airport abuja for all the airlines operations including both international and domestic services subject to compliance with icaos standard and recommended practices on aviation security
6487646 yuguda unfortunately endorsed the letter but the pertinent question is should a letter written by sir branson on virgin atlantic letter head be binding on our country even if the minister endorsed it why was the issue not part of the memorandum of undertaking signed by all the parties is that the way business transactions are conducted with nations that a company chief executive would after publicly signing a memorandum of undertaking with the government now write a personal letter on his companys letter head and expect any self respecting nation to take that as a binding contract just because he got somebody to append his signature to it
6487647 one major challenge for this administration is the fact that over the years public officials hardly bothered about the interest of our people when entering into contracts and agreements on behalf of the federal government that is why our oil industry remains what it is today since most of the contracts were written by the multinational oil companies to the detriment of the nation and our officials merely signed but with president yaradua many things are going to change and he will use the law as his weapon
6487648 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps
6487649 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust

6487660 but we are paying tribute to him in a ceremony on monday and that is as it should be because sen kennedy passed the torch to sen obama
6487661 i think that were going to leave denver as a united party
6487662 were going to be fired up and ready to go were going to be able to show that barack obama is the best choice for this country he has already restored our governments tarnished image around the world and we will need to have him to tackle the problem of our economy our biggest problem is the drain on our resources of this war in iraq and barack obama knew from the beginning that it was wrong
6487663 mccains policies are similar to bushs and you would be getting a third bush term with mccain
6487664 no one wants that people are hungering for change and not just democrats but republicans and independents
6487665 the story of obama sends a powerful message to our children that if you work hard sacrifice and play by the rules you can become president of the united states
6487666 you dont have to be born rich or with a silver spoon to be president of the most powerful country in the world
6487667 whoever thought in my lifetime we would see a woman and an african american battling for the nomination of the party this was a situation where heads i win tails i win because i never thought id live to see the day a minority either an african american or a woman would be in this position i think hillary clintons historic effort should be recognized if obama had come in second place i would have wanted the same thing for him
6487668 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome
6487669 todays deteriorating air travel system skyrocketing fuel prices and poorly communicated security policies are deterring domestic and international inbound travel and costing the u s economy billions of dollars it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
6487670 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6487671 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6487672 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6487673 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6487674 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
6487675 we will look into it we have a formal complaint the possibility is we will take an enforcement action
6487676 over and over a catalog of hand drawn patterns collects groundbreaking work from fifty of todays most talented designers who create patterns by hand and use them in their work in inventive and innovative ways from deanne cheuks patterns that adorn current fashion to those of robin cameron that explore her interest in art to garrett morins patterns that arose from an exercise for a character called eloie the examples in this book push the boundaries of the traditional concept of what a pattern is the selected works are often not an end result but the beginning of something else of something bigger and broader while the computer is sometimes involved in the production of patterns the hand drawn element is always evident in the uniqueness of these works featuring more than 250 vibrant and exciting patterns over and over explores this magic on every single page and will inspire designers everywhere

6487679 people who have comprehensive health and disability coverage are often surprised by out of pocket medical and unanticipated non medical expenses
6487680 it isnt surprising that critical illness insurance is prevalent in europe and canada where universal health care coverage is available because even when medical coverage is very low or free there are significant costs associated with experiencing a serious illness group critical illness insurance was designed to provide an affordable solution

6487689 it was kind of weird seeing the others get to keep playing
6487690 but we treated that like it was our championship game
6487691 redshirting an entire class took a lot of patience from our fans
6487692 and to everybodys credit nobody looked at it like a throwaway year surviving that season ending up with a bunch of men on the following years team instead of a mix and match really helped us through that transition thats the single biggest thing that we did that maybe wasnt done in some other places
6487693 there was one division i offer among those three guys
6487694 so they all came into this with the feeling they had something to prove nobody wanted them
6487695 we played a big ten caliber schedule every year thats the way they looked at it
6487696 when we went down to florida for my first game as a head coach last year i was more nervous than they were
6487697 i felt the same way i do whenever i help one of my seniors get a job
6487698 but this was definitely more special because it was our first draft pick and because hes such a special kid ive known george since he was coming to our basketball camps in the sixth grade and i know where hes come from it means more to me than it might to a normal coach
6487699 he had signed with oregon state but his english wasnt good enough to get a good act score
6487700 he was going to play professionally over in europe but his handlers think he has a chance to play professionally here in the united states so we got involved with him and he finally made the test score and decided to sign with us hopefully thats going to be more than just a one year deal and hell stay here for four years and get his degree
6487701 our league has figured out that to compete against teams outside the conference we have to do it with shooting
6487702 because we have guys who can make shots 1 foot is not going to make a difference where i think youll see the line move make a difference is the teams that shoot it average most of the ones that kangas takes are a foot back anyway
6487703 you have your first really good start in two years then your front four players go down
6487704 we had head injuries hand injuries bad ankles broken bones ripped muscles concussions here and there our leading scorer broke his foot in the first conference game id never seen anything like it
6487705 it was unfortunate but i was really proud of the way our team kept battling through it
6487706 they could have thought they were destined for failure and folded their tents but they didnt they wouldnt accept failure
6487707 with all the injuries they had theyd become very guard oriented at that point they really just shot the lights out against us theyll be very talented with most of those guys back and should be a team thatll be there every year they have resources that a lot of us dont have
6487708 this is the most optimistic ive ever been going into the season were more talented than weve been
6487709 you can have your ups and downs during the season
6487710 but when it comes to march though everythings on the table in march our players go into the league tournament knowing that northwestern state belongs there when youve been able to consistently win in march theyre going to expect to keep doing that
6487711 athletic shooter scorer hes been our leading rebounder last two years and gets in the passing lanes on defense if he can improve his ballhandling and passing hell be a hell of a pro he could seriously be making money somewhere as a two guard
6487712 sam houston state us uta and lamar were the best teams in the league last year
6487713 the nflpa approaches this as an economic issue and we all know it is a moral issue
6487714 he was a great man abandoned by the league he helped build
6487715 automatic thrust reverser deployment will be one of the things that air crash investigators will be looking at

6487862 whether you love us or hate us whether you believe in american power or dont the convergence of hot flat and crowded has created a challenge so daunting that its impossible to imagine a meaningful solution without america taking the lead and being at its best we are either going to be losers or heroes there is no room anymore for anything in between we are either going to rise to the level of innovation leadership and collaboration that is required or everyone is going to lose in a big way just coasting along and kinda sorta doing the right things when they are convenient and easy and letting the other stuff slip that is not an option anymore

6487932 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6487933 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6487934 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6487935 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6487936 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state

6487939 the whole event had sort of taken over my life i was equally fascinated and disgusted by the whole thing as well as by the lack of response
6487940 i think hes just using that as an excuse to help promote his game being it comes out so close to the remembrance of the attack

6487943 people are upset with the war and stuff whats so bad about bigfoot nobody got hurt
6487944 it got into something much bigger than it was supposed to be
6487945 it started off as just some youtube videos and a web site were all about having fun
6487946 a defense attorney could put him on the stand and say you lied about this how do we know youre not lying now
6487947 i dont believe it does affect my credibility at all because this is bigfoot
6487948 it would be one thing if i came out and said i had something else that is tangible or real but right now as far as im concerned there is no real bigfoot

6487955 it doesnt take a lot of courage to go to martinsville and talk about trade

6487957 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp

6487960 because patriotism is supporting your country all the time but your government only when it deserves it
6487961 we should know in four or five months if it will work and if it doesnt we can look at flow restrictors and other actions
6487962 this is a substantial change based on the input of the community
6487963 as managers we have to think and plan regionally and globally but we have to report to local populations
6487964 its very important that you provide as broad a definition of agriculture as you can
6487965 water demand has exceeded water supply i commend your actions the inclined block rate structure is the engine in the water conservation car i know this works we used it in the city of santa barbara you dont know what effect it will have but you have to move forward with it to see where it goes
6487966 weve got a great history with them so its going to be a great battle
6487967 this is a team that has been playing better as the games have progressed and they are playing good its going to be a great test for us and i wouldnt want it any other way
6487968 weve got to play the perfect game and theyve got to miss more than usual
6487969 but its only one game thats all it takes 40 minutes we going to play the best way we can and try to do what looks impossible right now
6487970 both were pretty big the first one was the first one overall and thats always big
6487971 nobody had beaten them before and we did it first it was important for us because if we lost that game we had to play serbia in the quarterfinal and that would have been pretty tough but our victory put us against brazil and it made our way into the final much easier
6487972 the second one gave us a silver medal at least and it was the second time which was harder
6487973 they will attack us with their system and they believe they can beat us
6487974 theyve definitely found the way to play the fiba game and theyre playing way better
6487975 they have players that are superstars but they have a commitment they want to win and they prepare and they know what theyre doing
6487976 theyve been playing great ive been watching them they beat spain by 40 points actually 37 and thats not easy to do im telling you that right now
6487977 i cant wait i cant wait to get over that hump
6487978 these last two games theres no reason to hold anything back to be a champion you have to beat a champion they still have the gold medal no matter who won the world championship in 06 we have to go out there and take that from them
6487979 basically they were going through garbage is what they were doing
6487980 if gas hits 6 per gallon obama will be out there with the ceremonial drill bit saying
6487981 they all choose to be here we need the lowered heights initiative to preserve our economy it keeps us different
6487982 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6487983 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6487984 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6487985 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6487986 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6487987 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6487988 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6487989 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6487990 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6487991 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6487992 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6487993 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6487994 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6487995 are working together as partners to make certain we cover the concerns of both parties
6487996 might be useful to come out at this stage and get an update and be able to go back and brief the president
6487997 its a very gratifying time because were in a position where we believe were going to be able to hand most security functions to the iraqis

6488005 im supposed to be having a home visit with memphis head coach john calipari sept 9 but we have to finalize that
6488006 memphis i like that school i like their style of play oregon kansas i like their style of play n c state is right back home so i feel like all the schools have the same interest in me right now baylor dont have the lead or nobody has the lead
6488007 it helps them a little bit because he was my aau coach
6488008 he worked me out most of my last two years of high school ball he was like an older brother to me something i dont have so its kind of a tight relationship so that helps a little bit
6488009 i couldnt see much of the campus i was there for a day and a half so it was all right my schools small so i could go to a small school and get my work done and get better at my game
6488010 and what they did for derrick rose they just got him there to the nba im trying to be one and done but if it dont ill stay in school and get my education
6488011 if i finish school early i will go back and get my degree because i promised her id go to college
6488012 after i take my visit if i feel its the school i want to say it is ill make the announcement right then and there
6488013 i feel like i can be a lot better at a lot of things
6488014 this year ive been working on my mid range shot thats what i shoot a lot because people have to play up close to me so i can get past them easier
6488015 you can always work on your defense your ballhandling i like to change directions and mix up my speeds once i start mixing up my speeds people cant stay in front of no more i feel like you always can get better
6488016 it was one round too many for her she jumped the first round fantastic but in warm up i just sensed she didnt really feel she wanted to go again
6488017 she wasnt the same horse in that round it is disappointing but that is the way it goes
6488018 i came here looking to win otherwise there is no point taking part in the olympics but i am pleased with how i have done
6488019 once a breakthrough has really been achieved the draft will be presented to the council of ministers
6488020 were making an agreement because the surge has worked iraqi forces have demonstrated they are strong and getting stronger
6488021 temporary presence and time horizon and mission of us troops
6488022 were not going to let russia so soon after the iron curtain fell to again draw a dividing line across europe
6488023 the g 8 should become for a while the g 7 until russia proves that it is capable of being a law abiding member of the international community
6488024 secretary of state lieberman endorses dumb plan to kick russia out of the g 8
6488025 the g 8 should become for a while the g 7 until
6488026 but mr liebermans national security credentials are first rate and weve known him long enough to remember his opposition to an income tax in connecticut and his support for lower capital gains taxes school vouchers and private social security accounts

6488034 the degree to which islamist extremists around the world have dropped their previous obsession with iraq and now focus on the afghan pakistan area has been astounding
6488035 no one recruiting for or seeking to join jihadist fighting in europe are trying to get to iraq its all afghanistan now
6488036 no one raising money for jihad is directing funds to iraq either the afghan pakistan region has regained the power of attraction it had prior to september 11
6488037 it was the original jihad against occupying infidels and it was long al qaedas terror sanctuary bin laden still lurks there somewhere
6488038 afghanistan isnt just about killing americans but fighting the assembled forces of the world they accuse of attacking islam
6488039 beyond the immediate human reaction to this loss of life this attack is most instructive in telling us about the rapidly rising strength and capacity of the people were up against

6488044 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioral patterns
6488045 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction
6488046 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6488047 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6488048 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6488049 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future
6488050 what im saying is out of love unconditional and pure
6488051 it looks like a pterodactyl out of a gay jurassic park
6488052 i think youre right when you say this would appeal
6488053 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6488054 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6488055 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6488056 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6488057 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6488058 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6488059 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6488060 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6488061 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6488062 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6488063 el mayor fraude a la constituci n que se haya visto en el pa s
6488064 lo que estamos viendo es un verdadero gacetazo producido por el ejecutivo nacional que ha hecho un uso abusivo de la habilitaci n que le ha concedido el parlamento
6488065 los poderes legislativo y judicial est n refrendando este fraude
6488066 lo que estamos observando es la puesta en marcha de una constituci n paralela en la que la mayor falacia apunta hacia los consejos comunales como detentadores del poder cuando en verdad quedan eliminadas las competencias de las alcald as y las gobernaciones para d rselas a unos funcionarios designados por el presidente

6488100 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6488101 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6488102 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6488103 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6488104 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6488105 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6488106 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies

6488114 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
6488115 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
6488116 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
6488117 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
6488118 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
6488119 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
6488120 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
6488121 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
6488122 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
6488123 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
6488124 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
6488125 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
6488126 the reason for allowing the order to lapse is that i dont think it is necessary to create additional special categories or special rights
6488127 we are firmly and strongly committed to fair treatment of all of our people and certainly dont condone discrimination in any form
6488128 then a member of congress joined with sen james david cain and two republican members of the legislature to fight the measure

6488147 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6488148 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6488149 davis embarked on what can only be characterised as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6488150 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6488151 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6488152 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6488153 where davis went wrong was when he endeavoured to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6488154 when i think of all the harm the bible has done i despair of ever writing anything to equal it

6488159 delay doesnt work as a tactic i want them to come in quickly and resolve this expeditiously

6488169 we continue to manage the business extremely well in the trenches in the midst of what is a very soft retail environment
6488170 has managed costs well in this challenging environment we are growing increasingly concerned by potential price erosion driven by online competitors
6488171 not a normal sale of shares but rather a complex project made up of myriad elements
6488172 we are enthusiastic about the prospect of investing our capital expertise time and energy to put ikb back on a sustainable path to long term value creation for all stakeholders
6488173 lone star has the solid basis to support the strategy of strengthening ikb as a leading provider of financial solutions for germanys mittelstand
6488174 as long as the commodity side of the business is not being detrimental to our results were satisfied with that
6488175 that was obviously not the picture in this quarter and it wont be next quarter either

6488185 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6488186 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style

6488194 the sight of a feather in a peacocks tail whenever i gaze at it makes me sick
6488195 how can this trait be made in one gender and not the other
6488196 males and females basically have the same set of genes so how do you specifically modify the activity of a males genes but not a females genes
6488197 the flies did not need new genes to make a new pattern
6488198 they just changed how males and females use a common set of genes
6488199 the switch existed for tens of millions of years because it had a different job
6488200 but it got remodeled evolution is a cumulative process you have this machinery and its easy to add a bell or a whistle with this particular trait it evolved by exploiting genetic information that was already there to make male bodies different from female bodies
6488201 we have enough evidence to believe this evolved in a male specific way
6488202 if female tastes change these traits go away there is no reinforcement
6488203 as long as the gain outweighs the cost the feature will survive the fruit flys color pattern is a paradigm for understanding how to use the same sets of genes in different sexes to come up with different features
6488204 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
6488205 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
6488206 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
6488207 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
6488208 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
6488209 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play

6488266 amd had delivered same day linux support when launching the radeon hd 4800 series this summer this was a first for amd when launching a major product revision that there was same day support considering for the r500 and r600 and earlier generations it had taken months for any level of support on linux this was great to see and the radeon hd 4850 4870 performance was terrific thanks to their new opengl driver introduced last september today amd has announced another catalyst driver release for linux and this is arguably the most significant driver update since last octobers release when aiglx support was added catalyst 8 8 delivers crossfire support on linux overdrive overclocking support adaptive anti aliasing support and other improvements

6488268 when it comes to ati hardware one of the features we have been after for the longest time on linux has been any overclocking support windows users have atis overdrive at their disposal along with an arsenal of third party utilities such as ati tool nvidia also has various utilities for overclocking their graphics cards on windows but they also provide support for overclocking on linux today though with the release of the catalyst 8 8 linux driver there is finally ati overdrive 5 support on linux

6488279 after seeing the headroom still left on evgas gtx 260 ftw card i was expecting big things from the palit gtx 260 initially i was slightly disappointed that i could not match the overclocking ability of the evga card but when you sit back and think you realize that this is not a factory overclocked card as such it is binned a little lower and costs a little bit less as well what i did get from the card was 128mhz on the gtx 260 core 112mhz on the memory and 276mhz on the shader clocks as a percentage the increases equal out to an 18 jump in the gpu core speed 10 on the memory and almost 20 on the shader clocks all of these increases are pretty substantial and provide a serious performance boost when the cpu does not bottleneck the systems performance
6488280 bfg has a great power suppy here not only does it look good but it does it with performing style for the duration of the testing and the subsequent gaming session afterwards performance remained solid while silence was in full effect i found no issues with any of the cabling or the installation of the unit that was the fault of the unit overall i would have to say that if youre in the market for a psu at this price point 219 bfgs es800 is an excellent choice while its lack of support for tri sli is definitely disappointing its ability to take a system with two 4870x2 or 9800gx2 cards is admirable

6488293 the authorities here will not see lebanon as an asylum country until the palestinian issue has been resolved

6488316 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed

6488325 yesterday john mccain was asked again what do you think about the economy he said i think the economy is fundamentally strong
6488326 now this puzzled me i was confused what he meant but then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and they said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong but if you are like me and youve got one house or if you are like the millions of people struggling now to keep up with your mortgage payments you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes

6488340 we think ps4 may come in as soon as 3 years but honestly nobody knows not even sony we think xbox might come a little later
6488341 at the same time if we want to have new games and graphics past that point well have to look at new methods such as alternatives to rasterization such as point based rendering and ray tracing

6488349 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6488350 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6488351 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6488352 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6488353 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6488354 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces

6488362 i did not fight to my full 100 per cent capacity but i am very happy
6488363 we definitely needed a change at halftime and we tried to get things going with fatmire bajramaj and conny pohlers and they gave us more attack in the second half
6488364 i am happy with getting the medal as in the first half we did not have the forward play as we did throughout the tournament our forward play was not good enough we didnt pass as well as usually do but our defence was okay
6488365 all the players did their best they did everything they had been working towards and we lost but we will learn from our defeat
6488366 we did not have a dedicated masseur i asked a masseur do you have time to attend me and he said no
6488367 so team manager kartar singh had to do the job we did not have any idea about the doctors either who had been attached with the contingent
6488368 going into my fourth bout of the day i was really tired and there was hardly any time to relax in between i badly needed the rubbing and massaging
6488369 trust me gold medal is not an absurd dream we have a talent pool deep enough and all you need is infrastructure
6488370 i just gorged on food before a bout we generally go on a fast to ensure we are not overweight even if you drink a glass of water it becomes a reason for panic
6488371 once my bout was over i had enough food im a vegetarian and i ate mostly fruits

6488379 i thought about it and after being left out the national team again i realised there was little scope for me to show how i could hold down the position
6488380 i didnt break the world record because of the weather
6488381 it was better than a sunny and hot day i didnt feel it was very slippery
6488382 i was in good condition i think my regular training is the most important factor contributing to my victory

6488389 it was so frustrating to negotiate the settlement due to all the moving parts
6488390 i wanted to wrap up all of this litigation in one big settlement even though some elements of the resolution would have benefited my competitors so i insisted that the qsi suit be resolved as well as the real rail effects suits against the other named parties this was one of the reasons this thing took so long but in the end it was worth the wait

6488422 let me ask you subhuti if a person filled over ten thousand galaxies with the seven treasures for the purpose of compassion charity and giving alms would this person not gain great merit and spread much happiness
6488423 yes most honored one this person would gain great merit and spread much happiness even though in truth this person does not have a separate existence to which merit could accrue why because this persons merit is characterized with the quality of not being merit
6488424 then suppose another person understood only four lines of this sutra but nevertheless took it upon themselves to explain these lines to someone else this persons merit would be even greater than the other persons why because all buddhas and all the teachings and values of the highest most fulfilled most awakened minds arise from the teachings in this sutra and yet even as i speak subhuti i must take back my words as soon as they are uttered for there are no buddhas and there are no teachings

6488426 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6488427 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6488428 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6488429 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6488465 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
6488466 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6488467 n o covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
6488468 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time

6488479 for the pacific islands forum to declare an unequivocal condemnation of bainimarama the interim prime minister of fiji is itself unprecedented
6488480 secondly what was unprecedented was for the first time the forum countries giving definition to special measures that is the inclusion of suspension
6488481 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight a snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6488482 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle
6488483 the interim government has been making excuses all this time simply for the purpose of delaying elections

6488488 i dont know i dont know i didnt see the horse and it certainly didnt present anything like these other infected horses
6488489 there has to be a lot of exposure to an infected horse
6488490 thats the frightening thing about the disease the horse can apparently be normal

6488494 other banks should have a good hard look at themselves and look at what the nab has done
6488495 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6488496 if the rba does 50 basis points we will see how the money market reacts
6488497 todays decision by the national australia bank is a major victory for common sense and a victory for their customers hit by eight rate rises in three years families have been doing it tough on the back of record inflation thats why this is such an important decision

6488505 ironie ist wenn du etwas sagst manchmal sogar extra doll bertreibst obwohl du doch das gegenteil meinst wie vorhin beim mittagessen als mami gefragt hat ob ich noch spaghetti haben will ich war ja schon total satt habe aber gesagt nat rlich noch drei teller mindestens verstehst du
6488506 ah ja glaub das hab ich verstanden und was ist sarkasmus
6488507 sarkasmus na du stellst fragen sarkasmus ist irgendwie trockener provokanter entstammt extremeren situationen galgenhumor der ist meistens sarkastisch wei t du noch als wir zu tante gabi nach mannheim fahren wollten und uns auf der autobahn der motor abgeraucht ist da meinte mama zu mir na immerhin m ssen wir uns jetzt keine ausrede einfallen lassen warum wir zu sp t kommen ich glaube das war schon recht sarkastisch
6488508 there are no more other opportunities if the president of the republic has come and a solution is not found then what other solution is there these are my words
6488509 you told munj you accepted the solution of compromise that i have presented
6488510 the command does some things wrong but there is in no country or any state which after such efforts would accept your attitude
6488511 many opportunities have been given to you many opportunities i have said many times already that during these months that good positive behaviour will help to stabilise the situation
6488512 many people dont understand many suspect that i would also support you from behind i dont i only look to do dialogue and dialogue and dialogue i try to look at the problems from each side
6488513 however major alfredo reinado the moment has come that we must go forward meet each other to bow to each other because the reason is not 100 per cent on your side or 100 per cent on the side of the government or ffdtl the timorese defence force if you want to show the community that we can find solutions for the problem and show that only you are right then there is no solution
6488514 taur says we will not accept them to come back because we already sacked them

6488517 we say dias received large sums of money from persons involved in the drug trafficking and he helped deal with the proceeds in these offences
6488518 dias received money from the criminal syndicate and he assisted in the banking so similar values could be made available to the criminal syndicate overseas

6488523 mr rudd talks about delivering open accountable and responsive government
6488524 why wont the government release the emergency advice commissioned by senator wong on short term options for the lower lakes
6488525 my view is that what australians want on the murray darling basin is action not another inquiry
6488526 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia
6488527 if you do own water you are allowed to do what you like with it thats our problem we need a national body that makes the river flow
6488528 without a national body independent of every government you do not have a river that will be able to flow because it will be run by votes
6488529 we need something right now to get us through this summer
6488530 at the moment the commissioner will say he cant do anything even though the law produces a stupid outcome and say it is up to treasury to fix it
6488531 more radically we have recommended that the private sector be involved
6488532 there should be tripartite ownership of tax changes with treasury having charge of policy the tax office looking after administration and the industry providing a user perspective

6488543 the book itself captures the enduring fascination of the life of eric liddell known as the
6488544 it is thrilling to see how eager the chinese are to read running the race and embrace the story of eric liddell
6488545 and best yet through our efforts the gospel that eric preached is still being preached today in the land that he loved the race that he started is still being run today for gods glory

6488561 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6488562 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6488563 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6488564 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded

6488573 the thermage board of directors will consider the unsolicited non binding proposal in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties and in accordance with its obligations under its merger agreement with reliant
6488574 following its review of the unsolicited non binding proposal thermages board will respond in due course
6488575 we are not surprised to see this bid given the marginal strategic rationale for the pending acquisition of reliant and thermages current valuation
6488576 fundamentals for companies in the residential markets continue to remain very weak and there is a real fear that results could get worse over the next 12 months the new negatives come in european markets as they seem to be weakening particularly fast in the third quarter of 2008
6488577 our estimates are on average 16 percent below the street but do not include any raw material decline benefit for manufacturers or deterioration for distributors in the year we believe our peers estimates will be headed our way
6488578 i can confirm the remains of one of our courageous world war i soldiers have been uncovered in belgium
6488579 two british archaeologists undertaking an official excavation unearthed the remains along with evidence they are of a fallen australian digger who fought in the battle of messines
6488580 the australian government is firm in our commitment to honor our war dead and is already undertaking historical research to establish any initial identification links
6488581 we are also hopeful that some of the equipment located with the remains such as badges and buttons may assist with identification of the soldier and will consider the possibility of dna testing if there is reasonable chance of a match
6488582 we believe suntech with its expansion should become the largest solar photovoltaic module producer in the world
6488583 in our view stp is poised to grow eps rapidly and to sustain margins against potential rapid declines in module prices in 2009 due to high leverage to silicon price reductions and the introduction of a new high efficiency cell technology

6488599 thousands of new auto supply jobs will follow the 2 000 new jobs planned for the new assembly plant
6488600 that has been tennessees experience over the last thirty years
6488601 the gm saturn and nissan plants employ over 10 000 people but have been the magnet to attract more than 125 000 auto related jobs to tennessee the chattanooga area should look forward to the same
6488602 senator corker governor bredesen mayors ramsey and littlefield the chamber of commerce and many others have worked hard to make this happen
6488603 their work will continue to pay off as the chattanooga area sees improvements across the board for years to come the arrival of the auto industry in tennessee has transformed our lives today one third of tennessees manufacturing jobs are auto jobs
6488604 before the auto industry came to the state tennessee was the fourth poorest state with only arkansas maine and mississippi below us
6488605 most of the auto industry was in the midwest tennessee had almost no auto jobs then saturn and nissan came then hundreds of suppliers came then nine more assembly plants throughout the southeast volkswagens decision to come to chattanooga keeps tennessee on the road to becoming the no 1 state in auto supply jobs and puts the south further down the path towards becoming the new center for the american automobile industry
6488606 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6488607 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6488608 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6488631 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6488632 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6488634 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6488635 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6488636 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6488637 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6488638 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6488639 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6488640 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6488641 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6488642 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6488643 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6488644 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6488645 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6488646 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6488647 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6488648 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

6488650 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6488651 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6488652 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6488653 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6488654 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6488655 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6488656 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6488657 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6488658 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6488659 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6488661 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6488674 in the south caucasus u s and european state interests are bound up with the commercial interests of major oil companies that form the principal caspian energy consortia
6488675 to secure their investments in the caspian sea basin these companies have found allies among u s geostrategists who support a strong u s presence among russias neighbors high level former officials such as zbigniew brzezinski brent scowcroft john sununu james baker and richard cheney when he was head of halliburton have all visited baku azerbaijan and the caspian region and lobbied in favor of the oil companies
6488676 for an organization that has come to rely heavily on words and symbolism nato issued a disconcertingly evasive communiqu at its emergency meeting on georgia

6488712 peleamos hasta el final este es un momento muy duro
6488713 no es que no creamos oportunidades lo que nos falt fue paciencia ellas hacen un tiro y anotan y el que anota gana
6488714 tenemos que aprender a ser pacientes y a sacar el partido adelante cuando estamos perdiendo

6488721 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6488722 great food is like great sex the more you have the more you want
6488723 there are a lot of communities that will see a significant reduction in rail traffic if the transaction goes through
6488724 this proposed purchase will help improve the quality of life in more than 60 communities
6488725 i believe that these issues in these communities should be mitigated in a reasonable manner
6488726 i would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of gene upshaw he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6488727 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels it is a sad day for the nfl but genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come all of us in the nfl reach out with our sympathy to terri and the upshaw family
6488728 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6488729 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6488730 gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans we as well as the entire nfl family will miss his presence dearly
6488731 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with the presidents at the time be it troy vincent and trace armstrong they worked to get us in a very good position and hes left us in a very good position

6488747 governor pawlenty does not use e mail as a communications vehicle our office does however maintain an e mail address titled tim pawlenty state mn us as listed on the governors web site there is no other state e mail address for the governor
6488748 it just doesnt fit with how things are done these days
6488749 they are correct about access to the governors calendar advisory opinions have held that such calendars even of high ranking officials are not public data

6488794 the free service gives canadians convenience and control over bill receipt and payment eliminating multiple user names and passwords
6488795 i welcome the views of those concerned with youth justice as efforts are made to ensure the ycja works fairly and effectively for all canadians

6488829 milk is after all specifically designed to make things grow
6488830 a diet high in sugars and saturated fats is rich in free radical causing agents which will exacerbate acne but acne is triggered by hormones and is not caused by diet
6488831 science does not support links between acne and dairy foods
6488832 unnecessary exclusion of dairy from the diet can compromise nutrient intakes this is especially important for teenagers who are most likely to suffer with acne and for whom the bone building nutrients found naturally in dairy foods are so important
6488833 my dermatological colleagues insist with justification on a full double blind randomised controlled trial but so far it has been impossible to arrange such a trial double blinding dairy intake is essentially impossible because we have no hormone free dairy we could feed people as a placebo

6488848 we believe that web 2 0 technologies will define and be defined by the skill requirements of the 21st century workforce

6488857 confessed victims of child abuse like confessed criminals confessed rapists and confessed child abusers and confessed murderers this sick and twisted statement sits happily on the front page of extra on line i guess the people at extra agree that children who are being abused should keep their mouths shut confessing sic telling the authorities that you are abused makes you vile and evil warner sic brothers should be ashamed of themselves
6488858 weve had to use grain or hops from the deschutes brewery the bend brewing co

6488875 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained

6488879 that details of the interception first published in a newsweek cover story were leaked by none other than colonel north himself
6488880 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth
6488881 many other reporters were mad at me but some commentators rightly pointed out that some values the obligation of reporters to their readers superseded the reporter source relationship and that if you used that relationship as a cover for lying you broke the implicit contract
6488882 in this instance where the source publicly accuses someone else of leaking a story for devious purposes its incumbent upon you to set the record straight

6488912 other banks should have a good hard look at themselves and look at what the nab has done
6488913 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6488914 if the rba does 50 basis points we will see how the money market reacts

6488916 mr rudd talks about delivering open accountable and responsive government
6488917 why wont the government release the emergency advice commissioned by senator wong on short term options for the lower lakes
6488918 my view is that what australians want on the murray darling basin is action not another inquiry
6488919 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia
6488920 if you do own water you are allowed to do what you like with it thats our problem we need a national body that makes the river flow
6488921 without a national body independent of every government you do not have a river that will be able to flow because it will be run by votes
6488922 we need something right now to get us through this summer
6488923 we have cancelled some flights certainly substituted aircraft and we have delayed some passengers just as every airline does
6488924 what we have not done and never will do is operate an aircraft that is not safe to fly
6488925 that is very very much in line with anywhere else in the world
6488926 airlines deal with this i think our performance overall is good
6488927 they show that previous estimates of the epidemics size and cost were very much understated

6488930 here is part ii of rick and jasons interview with photographer and author thom hogan
6488931 photosynth takes a collection of regular photographs and reconstructs them in a 3d environment it could take flickr photos of a monument like notre dame cathedral from hundreds of separate accounts and compile them into one continuous shot of the cathedral and its surroundings
6488932 this week jason and rick sat down with popular photographer and author thom hogan due to the length of the interview weve split this episode into two parts
6488933 this is the single biggest economic reform in nsw for five decades and mr ofarrell has now got to come out
6488934 hes had plenty of time to negotiate a position and hes been wasting all that time hes got nowhere to hide
6488935 its all about his leadership and the war within his own party my motivation is whats right for the public interest
6488936 our research tells us the governments plans would have significant and unintended consequences for business we dont believe the government intended to design a scheme to achieve the outcome of businesses and jobs moving offshore but that would be the outcome of the governments plans
6488937 we want to ensure that industry plays its part but that the cost is kept at a level which allows them to stay in australia rather than move to a less demanding jurisdiction
6488938 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6488939 serious questions need to be raised why the government should transfer billions of dollars of taxpayers revenue to businesses who have known an emissions trading scheme was coming over a decade ago
6488940 stressed the importance of iran and the role which it can play in the sensitive and volatile region
6488941 he hoped the existing problems between the islamic republic of iran and america would be removed someday
6488942 you have to grow up and my administration has to grow up with all due respect and find out if there is any common ground
6488943 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact
6488944 unless they are willing to address irans nightmares and guarantee its safety but that runs contrary to the reigning theology in washington that divides the world into good and evil and believes in the benefits of using force
6488945 this is a case where were remaining to sit on the sidelines
6488946 the three european countries that are negotiating with the iranians are saying look weve got to get in the deal with them
6488947 its the last one olympic softball final but what can you do they came out hard
6488948 it is a big encouragement and motivation for us to get softball back into the olympic games
6488949 we will promote it all over the world every corner of the world
6488950 this was not a shooting that was a random act it was not random in nature
6488951 it is a terrible tragedy and it is a terrible tragedy that we work every minute and every day with our law enforcement partners to try and prevent
6488952 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6488953 our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6488954 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6488955 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6488956 he would hold a match in one hand and a hose in the other he could flip back and forth with effectiveness
6488957 his passion for his players was real his passion to lead was real
6488958 counting the afl championship in 1967 and victories in super bowls xi and xv upshaw became the only player ever to start on championship teams in both the afl and nfl
6488959 the feeling is hard to describe after all these years i never thought it would come down to this you give up hope
6488960 would say hi like nothing happened i wish i knew back then what i know today
6488961 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
6488962 senator mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
6488963 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6488964 can nominate or try and nominate anyone he wants he is in fact the leader of the party now going forward but it would be a very bumpy road
6488965 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states
6488966 he will select the person that is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that

6488969 wir haben zu viel respekt gezeigt und am ende wurden wir durch eine aktion bestraft
6488970 wir m ssen k nftig unsere torchancen besser n tzen sonst wird es schwer mit dem klassenerhalt
6488971 ich bin sehr zufrieden mit meiner elf wir k nnen nun beruhigt in die n chsten partien gehen
6488972 ich bin begeistert von meinen jungs mit dieser einstellung k nnen wir unser saisonziel klassenerhalt erreichen
6488973 wir h tten mindestens einen punkt verdient aber f nf schlechte minuten haben uns um den verdienten lohn gebracht

6488978 valencia ist auf jeden fall ein interessanter kurs aber sicher kein typischer stadtkurs es gibt lange geraden und die strecke ist relativ breit
6488979 we dont just want commuters to drive ride the train and drive out without knowing what businesses in downtown tigard have to offer
6488980 commuters from tigard and the surrounding area who usually dont frequent downtown tigard will now be coming into downtown on a frequent basis because of wes and we want to engage and promote these local businesses during wes week and beyond
6488981 the response weve had from businesses so far has been phenomenal
6488982 some are actually coming up with their own ideas too
6488983 all the landscaping is done there are benches and trashcans whats left are the public art and bike lockers
6488984 this is a fairly unusual program and also a young program so theyre kind of learning as they go
6488985 in many places were trying to lead a market quite frankly where the market isnt there yet
6488986 sometimes youve got to go the extra mile to make sure that a project keeps going
6488987 if its not completed whatever money we did put in is kind of lost
6488988 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6488989 the 1992 team with icons such as michael jordan magic johnson and larry bird introduced nba basketball to the world stage sixteen years later kobe bryant lebron james and dwyane wade have become stern nba wants china league presence in india
6488990 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6488991 he will in fact be providing very significant exculpatory evidence
6488992 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6488993 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6488994 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6488995 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6488996 we will get 1 of the 4 6 billion enterprise 2 0

6488998 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6488999 this one gets a little spacey so stick with us
6489000 this one is on our new record two records from now it comes out in 2009
6489001 cutting down trees in a sustainable harvested forest which is what we draw our supply from is just like taking out corn or flowers and replanting them next year
6489002 from the hotels perspective this fits in very well with our recycling efforts our energy conservation
6489003 its something that is more sustainable than a typical plastic key we think its a great idea
6489004 you train your whole life and you want to win you dont expect to lose
6489005 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6489006 most likely to be accosted by chris hansen via hidden camera while frantically trying to hide a bottle of lube
6489007 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
6489008 by its very definition grace as it is worked out in our salvation is in direct opposition to all works and worthiness
6489009 the principal challenge for india is the building of a sustainable health system selective and fragmented strategies and lack of resources have made the health care system unaccountable disconnected to public health goals inadequately equipped to address peoples growing expectations
6489010 the trade offs in terms of welfare implications however cannot be ignored it will raise the overall cost of health care in the country and generate pressures for increased budgetary allocations for government hospitals to stay competitive
6489011 gradually shift the role of the state from being a provider to a purchaser of care
6489012 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
6489013 john mccain exposed just how out of touch he is with the experience of average pennsylvanians there are a lot of people in pennsylvania who have lost or are in danger of losing their only home unlike john mccain they dont have the luxury of forgetting how many homes they have
6489014 coming from someone whose economic adviser believes america is just a nation of whiners it really makes you wonder whether john mccain has any understanding of the challenges regular folks are facing when he owns so many homes that he cant even remember how many
6489015 the attraction to be stupid is a very powerful collective force but there
6489016 that is so tragic he was a class act and always a gentleman
6489017 i just loved the man mr rose certainly has lived an exemplary life he was a patriot he made history id see him every sunday he was just a beautiful person i respected him so much because he was such a gentleman
6489018 he and i worked together when i was mayor and did several things he went to washington with us and helped me get grants from the federal government several times
6489019 we applied for grants to do things like industrial park and other things
6489020 he was always just such a gentleman whenever he was around me or anyone else he was truly a great dothanite and did a lot for this community
6489021 he was an instructor of pilots at tuskegee airfield during world war ii under all sorts of problems inside the military and outside
6489022 my dad served in world war ii in the navy and that was the greatest generation no question about that mr rose was right in the middle of it he was a part of the greatest generation i will definitely will miss him he was tops oh i will miss him i will definitely miss him
6489023 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government
6489024 susanna is in the roman catholic canon it is daniel 13
6489025 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
6489026 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
6489027 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
6489028 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government
6489029 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government
6489030 the stage was designed to facilitate the candid and personal tone that americans have come to expect from senator mccain the intimate setting will be a fitting backdrop for senator mccains acceptance speech
6489031 walk in through the exit unlike the meandering upstairs this passageway is designed to shuttle people efficiently
6489032 hes got things to work on when and how and how much that all depends on the next couple of weeks he certainly has enough ability
6489033 i had since i was in pop warner and cba i just felt like i wanted to get it when i came here donovan mcnabb is one of my favorite players i used to watch him when i was growing up its a lot of pressure im just trying to live up to the pressure i like the pressure on me it makes me play better
6489034 i used to watch him when i was growing up
6489035 there comes a time in every mans life when he realizes that pizza the constant companion and dear friend of youth is a bigot guilty of ageism
6489036 reason being we have a young ball club and we have a lot of guys that know how to play the game its not necessarily just names on the paper youve got to learn how to play together thats why its good guys are here early it means a lot to us right now because in the long run well benefit from it
6489037 guys have made a mark in this league its a matter of getting the team together working hard and building good habits
6489038 nobody really knows what to expect especially when youre predicted so low as us it kind of gives us some extra motivation to be here
6489039 it is what it is thats why we play the games itll be a challenge for us obviously were a young team but you can only go up
6489040 ask my opponents if they like playing against me thats probably how you can get a feel for it i try to make every inch tough
6489041 devin has that ability also with his size and length and speed he can pick up the pressure on the defensive end we can set a tone with our defense when theres good ball pressure it just has a way of picking up the whole team defensively
6489042 auch auf mittlere sicht m ssen wir uns wegen des enormen nachfragepotenzials der schwellenl nder wohl weiterhin auf h here preise als in der vergangenheit einstellen
6489043 dennoch bleibt der starke anstieg der energie und rohstoffpreise in den letzten jahren im verbund mit anderen risiken ein ernster belastungsfaktor f r wachstum und besch ftigung in unserem land
6489044 dazu z hlt dass der leistungssch dliche anstieg der steuerbelastung durch die kalte progression vermieden wird
6489045 gerade deutschland konnte hiervon bereits in den letzten jahren sp rbar profitieren
6489046 durch die eingenommenen barmittel st rken wir unsere position nochmals deutlich um aktiv an der gegenw rtigen konsolidierung in der finanzdienstleistungsbranche teilnehmen zu k nnen
6489047 au erdem sichern wir durch diesen gemeinsamen schritt von mlp und bedeutenden produktpartnern dauerhaft das gesch ftsmodell des unabh ngigen beratungshauses
6489048 strategisch verstehe ich die kapitalerh hung als schritt das gesch ftsmodell zu sch tzen und zu zeigen das andere finanzdienstleister das modell weiter beibehalten wollen
6489049 erst im vergangenen jahr gab es ein aktienr ckkaufprogramm und jetzt sinkt der gewinn je aktie
6489050 das sieht wie eine klare abwehr von swiss life awd aus
6489051 wir gehen davon aus dass die physische nachfrage wegen des derzeit niedrigen preises deutlich anziehen wird so zahlen etwa indische schmuckhersteller den goldimporteuren derzeit wieder deutlich h here preise f r die physische ware
6489052 damit wird zwar am aktuellen rand ein weiteres anziehen der einkaufspreise der befragten unternehmen angezeigt die dynamik f llt aber geringer als zuletzt aus

6489061 the closing order indictment does not charge duch for his responsibility as a co perpetrator for a significant number of crimes that occurred as part of a joint criminal enterprise inside s 21
6489062 this may prevent the trial chamber from fully accounting for duchs criminal responsibility at s 21
6489063 shanghai is an international city a big city and everyday we have many foreigners visiting our temple so i think english is helpful for us
6489064 we know that china is hosting the olympics from 8 august 2008 and shanghai will be the site for the world expo in 2010 abbot juexing has foresight and is open minded so he picked some monks from our temple to study at shanghai international studies university this is also the first time that a secular university is cooperating with a temple
6489065 i think it is very important because when tourists come if we can actually hear about the monastery in the language we understand then we feel we relate better to it and especially if they live here they can probably give us more information about their experiences than a tour guide
6489066 the monks can give us a better insight into buddhism especially zen buddhism compared to a tour guide
6489067 we have our daily flight to moscow and we have additional capacity to bali it puts it together and we know that when people from russia come here they not only relax but also spend
6489068 the first semester has already hit three million and the second semester should be about four million more i think with singapore airlines and other flights we can achieve that
6489069 hong kongs economy will inevitably be affected by the fallout from a possible global slowdown but the impact is likely to be moderated by the favourable support from the mainlands solid sustainable development
6489070 as you take more broadband customers it will give us lower arpu however the broadband customers gives almost 90 per cent margins so as a whole the business is still on plan
6489071 obviously as in the chairmans statement we are still predicting we will be ebitda towards the end of the year on a monthly basis
6489072 because of inflation negative interest rate is getting very serious which is kind of positive for the property market i do not want to be reading the crystal ball for the future for our own business weve sold from the beginning of the year to june 30 over hk 23 billion worth of property just in hong kong alone excluding china which is a pretty high figure thats my barometer
6489073 the remarks by bishop joseph li shan on wednesday show that all chinese catholics love and respect the pope recognise his authority and would be happy to meet him and that is very positive and encouraging
6489074 we very much hope that the pope will come to china relations with the vatican are constantly improving
6489075 we hope he can visit china as soon as possible
6489076 that would be good for the chinese catholic church however the first step is to establish diplomatic relations
6489077 several important problems have not yet been resolved but the holy see wants to continue a loyal and constructive dialogue

6489081 as a traveller you dont really get an in depth understanding of how a society works so with couchsurfing staying with a local or even someone whos just been here for three to four years hes a fountain of information he has so many interesting stories to tell so its great
6489082 at the beginning of summer there were some requests i told them this is not like travelling to australia you will need a visa and documents that has stopped them from coming
6489083 its too bad that everything is so hard to get to its all fenced off for security reasons for example i wanted to go to the birds nest not knowing it was the rehearsal of the opening ceremony i had climbed up to get a picture the security officers asked me to get down
6489084 to learn how to use a sword one must first master when to use a sword
6489085 i think i speak for millions of people in the uk when i say we have been dazzled we have impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated
6489086 and in our own sweet way without wasting taxpayers money i am absolutely convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
6489087 the games are changing the public perception of the olympics olympo sceptics are being rapidly converted
6489088 i think millions of people in britain and in london are deeply concerned obviously about human rights in china
6489089 but i feel very strongly that these games offer a fantastic opportunity for china to open up to the rest of the world and for china to understand how the rest of the world thinks about china

6489113 in addition to strengthening our organic operations this acquisition adds significantly to our optimism about the future success of emrise
6489114 we believe the addition of acc will substantially strengthen our future operating results and overall financial condition in the 12 months following closing we expect acc to add 17 million to 18 million in revenues increase overall gross margins and make a major contribution to consolidated net income and earnings per share we expect accs profit contribution to begin with a small positive impact during the third quarter of 2008 and more material net income contributions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and going forward
6489115 we believe this will ensure that we and charles brand the former majority owner and ongoing president of acc are strategically aligned to achieve maximum benefits for emrise and its shareholders additionally with the federal net operating loss carry forwards that emrise has available we expect to shelter a large portion of accs earnings from federal taxation for the foreseeable future as a result we expect the acquisition will help generate stronger overall cash flow and be highly accretive to earnings

6489131 oils had an absolute humdinging couple of days and it seems as thoughpeople were premature in saying the oil story is over
6489132 the stocks that everyone has loved to hate over the last couple of monthsare the only thing that is keeping the index up
6489133 were focused on the long term here not the day to day stock price
6489134 focused on procuring only the highest grades of fairly traded teas and coffees obtained from the finest tea gardens and coffee farms
6489135 philosophy is grounded in purchasing their products only from growers that contribute to requisite wages schools and medical facilities for their workers
6489136 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6489137 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6489138 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6489139 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6489140 he has grown in stature over the last year since gary neville has been out injured
6489141 when he was at leeds i thought he was the leader bossing people about but when he came to united with big personalities like neville he became a lot quieter and left it to other people it was interesting that once neville got injured he took it upon himself to be the voice at the back there are not a lot of captains in the united team and the manager likes to have a few who are vocal he probably had a word with rio and it has had an effect on his game rio has the respect of everybody around him because of what he has achieved in the game
6489142 hes put the problems of a few years ago his contract dispute and the missed drugs test behind him his partnership with nemanja vidic is sensational and their defensive record over the last couple of years has shown that i know united score a lot of goals but when you are solid at the back it is the foundation for success when rio first came to united he didnt have a regular partner and that affected his form you need someone you can trust and work with week in week out the manager brought in vidic and the pair of them have formed a great understanding they are two different players like steve bruce and i were and it has worked well
6489143 i am honored to receive this award on behalf of the many individuals who have contributed to the success of qatars nationwide gis

6489146 plm apps are routinely cracked and pirated so are many other high value niche applications
6489147 ive talked to a software vendor who manufactures geology mapping software for oil drilling and every version of their software has been cracked and pirated
6489148 it could be a lead to a var value added reseller who could go in and say its great youre using this software but you need to pay up
6489149 its not easy to flag or reverse engineer our code its different in each implementation
6489150 they only want to do as much work as they need to meanwhile our technology lies dormant during that initial crack cycle
6489151 all the pirates have to do is identify the port or the gateway server and put a firewall rule or a network filtering rule to block that communication
6489152 once they find out the intelligence tool is preventing them from getting pirated revenue then the pirates will do something about it

6489200 i feel like it was a really good race for me it was my personal best for this season i knew i needed to get out quick because dayron robles is a very fast starter i wanted to be up there with him and i got medal for the usa im glad to be able to prove that i can do it when im supposed to be here our race would have been a lot faster with the previous world record holder liu xiang and terrence trammel in there bu tit was still a great race a couple of years ago nobody knew who david oliver or i was

6489202 i got a little bit scared i just tried to stay on it and got a medal out of it
6489203 even two years ago who would have though david payne and i would have been in a position to get medals except us and our support staff

6489206 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply andsupplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intensepressure
6489207 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind notseen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have moreprofound and lasting consequences this is what lies behindmuch of the dramatic increase in wholesale energy prices we haveexperienced

6489221 it is an incredible opportunity to tell the american people your vision for the country and what you will do as president and that can change the dynamics of the race
6489222 they are finished with just telling voters about themselves now they have to show voters they are ready to be president
6489223 there is definitely going to be a contrast drawn between the two candidates
6489224 this convention will make the choice crystal clear between two very different approaches to leadership
6489225 the real open question is what is he going to do he has to take that question head on in this convention and make it clear in an unequivocal way what the two or three priorities for his candidacy are

6489237 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

6489343 along with all the things that parents know are important for helping keep their kids healthy like washing hands and getting enough sleep flu vaccination should be right up there but this survey shows us that we still have a lot of educating to do
6489344 as a community we need to do a better job spreading the word about how important a yearly flu vaccine can be in helping protect kids and ourselves from influenza

6489346 these individuals belong to one of the most affluent generations in history and are willing and able to pay for products that provide anti aging benefits
6489347 weve given consumers a lot of clues over the years were from maine
6489348 if you look at our menu its the only state identified on the menu that is where consumers are convinced were from
6489349 why arent they here serving the great people of maine
6489350 if the company would like to claim their roots like ours are on the shores of new england
6489351 then perhaps they should try living with and serving the fine people of maine
6489352 shes amazing everyone loves her and she started crying when we all sang

6489354 a commodity is something we need not something we want
6489355 by tunneling deep into their pasts their paranoias and anxieties their troubled romantic relationships their outsize dreams lacy delivers a sophisticated psychological study of an ascendant economic class
6489356 for example suppose y combinator offers to fund you in return for 6 of your company in this case n is 06 and 1 1 n is 1 064 so you should take the deal if you believe we can improve your average outcome by more than 6 4 if we improve your outcome by 10 youre net ahead because the remaining 94 you hold is worth 94 x 1 1 1 034
6489357 it would improve the average startups prospects by more than 43 just to be able to say they were funded by sequoia even if they never actually got the money
6489358 its only seven minutes at the end of the play
6489359 lets take a big huge dump on mommybloggers while backhandedly praising a non mommyblogger for her internet success
6489360 i recently swapped a machine i built for my step mom for a dell pc that i bought and i wanted to change the name in the users folder from her name to mine i was able to change the account name but i havent been able to change the name in the users folder i thought a simple right click and rename would do it but not with vista home premium 64 bit any help would be great
6489361 d nde estaba su padre y cu ndo terminaba la pel cula
6489362 estaba muy entero se quejaba de algunos dolores pero lo que m s le preocupaba era encontrar a sus padres
6489363 we adoreren de chaos omdat we ervan houden de orde te herstellen
6489364 gt nieuwerwetse opvattingen over de rol van de dienstbare journalist het helder presenteren van een selectie van relevante online informatie in beide gevallen is er een eenvoudig maar zeer doeltreffend middel om orde aan te brengen in de chaos het lijstje
6489365 we adoreren de chaos omdat we ervan houden de orde te herstellen
6489366 if you think about the commerce scenarios you have this ability to provide a generalized overview of that that you might not have been able to before
6489367 this could be the start of the recovery in the market and it will be these groups that lead the way in that case but we still need to see confirmation of the trend
6489368 there would be an upside of 30 percent from these levels if you believe in a real rebound but you dont need to buy the first 5 percent
6489369 you can afford to wait for confirmation and still have ample opportunity to make money
6489370 the fundamental problems havent gone away were in the midst of a european recession were seeing earnings decline and we still expect further downgrades so the earnings side of the equation is still under heavy pressure
6489371 the market had definitely been ripe for a bump on the upside after julys floor and obviously hopes of lower interest rates have been helping
6489372 oils and materials came to a shuddering halt and investors moved out into the next story to pick the bottom in the financial sector and they were wrong
6489373 but we have to make the distinction between consumer discretionary and staples both sectors rallied but we would continue to shy away from discretionary and prefer staples as economic growth decelerates further
6489374 the price to earnings ratio on marks amp spencer is 5 5 on a trailing 12 month basis
6489375 if earnings were to halve that would be a p e of 11 with earnings at a cyclical low which sounds good
6489376 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28
6489377 rusia ne a informat prin canale militare ca ministerul apararii al federatiei ruse a luat decizia de a opri evenimentele internationale de cooperare militara programate intre rusia si tarile nato pana la primirea altor instructiuni
6489378 once a breakthrough has really been achieved the draft will be presented to the council of ministers
6489379 were making an agreement because the surge has worked iraqi forces have demonstrated they are strong and getting stronger
6489380 temporary presence and time horizon and mission of us troops
6489381 were pleased to add air touring gmbh to the mooney family representing us in germany austria and switzerland germany is home to the largest mooney owners organization outside of the u s
6489382 we have already had significant success working with air touring ltd in the u k and are looking forward to continuing and expanding our presence in the european market it remains a strong market for single engine aircraft
6489383 the degree to which islamist extremists around the world have dropped their previous obsession with iraq and now focus on the afghan pakistan area has been astounding
6489384 no one recruiting for or seeking to join jihadist fighting in europe are trying to get to iraq its all afghanistan now
6489385 no one raising money for jihad is directing funds to iraq either the afghan pakistan region has regained the power of attraction it had prior to september 11
6489386 it was the original jihad against occupying infidels and it was long al qaedas terror sanctuary bin laden still lurks there somewhere
6489387 afghanistan isnt just about killing americans but fighting the assembled forces of the world they accuse of attacking islam
6489388 beyond the immediate human reaction to this loss of life this attack is most instructive in telling us about the rapidly rising strength and capacity of the people were up against
6489389 the taliban have been allowed to reconstitute and re arm themselves to levels nearing those prior to the invasion
6489390 il nest pas question de r viser ou dajuster les perspectives de croissance on regardera cela avec mon coll gue du budget eric woerth l ch ance habituelle en septembre le projet de budget 2009
6489391 il faut serrer les dents et continuer le travail quon a commenc faire en r formant structurellement et en profondeur notre conomie fran aise
6489392 je consid re quen injectant 7 7 milliards deuros dans l conomie fran aise en 2008 avec un pr visionnel de 0 3 de croissance au titre de lapplication de la loi tepa en ann e pleine il faut tout simplement continuer
6489393 la loi tepa a permis datt nuer le choc et de soutenir une croissance ralentie par le contexte international
6489394 on a des l ments structurants qui permettent de soutenir les entreprises fran aises dans le cadre dun contexte conomique difficile
6489395 since he took power musharraf never gained the credibility and respect of his people as a strong leader who can run the country
6489396 musharraf saw himself as the savior who will prevent the country from deteriorating on several fronts particularly concerning to him was the escalation internally there was no guarantee that things wont get into chaos leading to the fall of pakistans nuclear weapons into the hands of the radicals and extremists
6489397 rejected its savior when he joined forces with the us and joined the war on terror this led him to fight his own people it made him look as if he participated in a war on islam
6489398 in pakistan the people of jihad are infiltrated into key positions in the intelligence community and the army for example it provides the mujahideen a great advantage
6489399 its over for you musharraf will the us stand with you now as you stood with them against muslims in pakistan and afghanistan
6489400 die telekom vollzieht zurzeit eine personalpolitik die sich eindeutig gegen die eigenen besch ftigten richtet
6489401 it was a very hard fought game and for us a hard earned three points
6489402 the win is based more on the determination of our team sometimes its necessary to win games in that way it was a game where we relied on the effort team spirit and the mentality of the group our experienced players have made the point to the team that qualifying is always difficult away from home you have to expect games to be very tough we have played some tough games in the last year but none of them are qualifiers to experience it and to win in that fashion is good for the group
6489403 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6489404 will step forward and call on the university to immediately release all the records
6489405 it leads me to have tremendous fear for the documents
6489406 what if they are going through them right now and deciding which names to take out im completely alarmed i think public scrutiny is the only way to save the documents
6489407 theyll manage to take this all the way past the election
6489408 they played us tough and executed extremely well particularly in the first half thats something we had to adjust to the gavin mills comment hit it right on the head did a great job of moving without the basketball thats something we talked about at halftime and making our adjustments and thats what we were able to do
6489409 all their guys are not afraid to take big shots
6489410 we cant lunge its the same philosophy we have been playing throughout this tournament they run their offense very well they are very effective setting screens they move well without the ball and they have a system that has been in place for eight years
6489411 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6489412 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6489413 on the one hand the crude inventory buildup was quite strong but the gasoline draw was also very prominent
6489414 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels
6489415 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bears sail in the energy complex
6489416 oil is the driver and then it depends on a series of other factors that are kind of like magnifiers
6489417 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6489418 we are like men building a wall against the sea it would be the height of folly on our part to give away any part of the cement that is required to make the wall secure that is why we and you have to use this money to build this great industry
6489419 it is obvious that science has grown exponentially over the 20th century to such an extent that the fragmentation of science makes it more difficult now than ever to identify an obvious winner for a discipline as a whole
6489420 whereas it was still relatively easy around 1910 to know who the most important scientists in a discipline were such a judgement is much more difficult since at least the 1970s
6489421 you cannot give a nobel for what i call good behaviour in science

6489432 recently booked a full day at the wheel of what is said to be the best custom motor racing simulator in the world the one run by former benetton technical chief nick wirth
6489433 the correlation between the simulation and reality is more than 95 per cent depending on how much data we have
6489434 youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
6489435 religion its given people hope in a world torn apart by religion
6489436 who needs satan when you have a god like this
6489437 hot on the heels of its magnanimous pardoning of galileo the vatican has now moved with even more lightning speed to recognise the truth of darwinism
6489438 the objections to religion are of two sorts intellectual and moral the intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow
6489439 beijing police decided to give the six 10 days of administrative detention

6489445 i gained a good insight into the power of openx it was really interesting to hear how different people use openx thanks openx
6489446 i came to this seminar because im launching a new business and wanted to find out if openx was adequately handle our unique needs your personal top level and very knowledgeable experts have made it crystal clear to me that this is an excellent solution thank you
6489447 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6489448 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6489449 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6489450 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6489451 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign and theyll make the announcement when theyre ready
6489452 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp
6489453 and if hes going to say one people one nation he can raise the banner of unity with her as his vice presidential running mate
6489454 some messages were not being received everybody was speaking over them
6489455 it was very very important that the building had not been inspected and we will deal with that
6489456 and probably thought he still had enough to get to the perimeter and get out
6489457 you are my brother in this world and in the next
6489458 and what actually is an elitist could obama pick a more uninspiring vp candidate than joe biden would we have been watching the beijing olympics if it were not for nixon en espa ol
6489459 come let us declare in zion the word of god
6489460 and what actually is an elitist could obama pick a more uninspiring vp candidate than joe biden would we have been watching the beijing olympics if it were not for nixon who found this interesting
6489461 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6489462 compassion and non violence can overcome intolerance and oppression beautiful ideals to be associated with the olympic spirit
6489463 rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase
6489464 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
6489465 itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china this would also explain why its happening to your friends there as well i would advise that you contact your isp about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk
6489466 what does ebs enable in short traditional processing on large datasets and reliable storage for many servers
6489467 many other applications that require running a file system or access to raw block level storage
6489468 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6489469 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6489470 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6489471 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6489472 its the heaviest of users that are directly contributing to the degradation of the service for the other people on the network
6489473 its an interesting reflection on the claim that there is a free market for broadband
6489474 if there was competition could you slow down your best customers
6489475 the fcc has required them to disclose all the details so we look forward to seeing that before we can fully evaluate any move that doesnt involve blocking consumers access to the internet is a positive step but we wont know for sure about this particular practice until we see the details
6489476 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6489477 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6489478 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6489479 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6489480 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6489481 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps
6489482 grazie alla collaborazione del secondo di adama che poi si rivelato uno degli ultimi
6489483 the partnership award is presented to a distinguished catholic leader who has shown courage and dedication to his or her life and work
6489484 russian and georgian people have always been together we know that russians have saved georgians from enslavement and extermination more than once we know how we helped each other in our shared trials whether it was the great patriotic war or hardships of the soviet period when faith and church were persecuted
6489485 we know how rich are our orthodox christian cultures how many russian georgian families live in russia and georgia how many georgians live in our country and make their worthy contribution in its economics culture science and other spheres of life today its very important not to waste the potential of our friendship and our mutual help
6489486 only a madman can declare all georgians are enemies and kindle anti georgian moods in the country
6489487 politicians come and go conflicts are always crowned with peace but nations keep on living and we have to show wisdom good will patience and love so that our orthodox peoples could always feel their connection to one gods affair to one church of christ and always prefer peace to hostility and love to hatred
6489488 on behalf of the mother church i am here to convey feelings of affection love and blessing to the pious people of greece i am praying these days for the victims of the caucasus war and i am praying for peace in our region and in the world
6489489 recent activity in ireland has a similar modus operandi to the uk it is the latest trend in this type of fraud in moving from targeting atm machines and targeting retail outlets to skim card details
6489490 this type of attack requires far greater effort and engineering to execute than you currently estimate is significantly difficult to industrialise to the number of devices that would gain criminals the return they would expect and therefore is not economically viable to criminals
6489491 companies are desperate for growth so m amp a mergers and acquisitions is replacing one off dividends as a companys most likely use of cash
6489492 this is a low risk strategy compared to the macho empire building that goes on when markets are rising like time warner and aol
6489493 mergers and acquisitions are tricky times for cios but they neednt be if they concentrate on getting the financial side of the it department right
6489494 if your company is paying 10 times earnings of say 5m the interest cost alone will be more than 2m
6489495 the cio might be able to save 1m of that in the first year which should make him or her popular in the boardroom
6489496 if you are big enough you should be good enough to take it operations in house
6489497 you should know on day one which projects you are going to keep which to kill and which staff to let go
6489498 its only fair to tell them as you walk in the door so that you and they can get on with life
6489499 each m amp a teaches you different things one way to increase its value to the organisation is to capture that knowledge in a way that you can apply it in future we learned a lot from the first one we did at scottish and southern by the time we did the fourth the it side was pretty slick
6489500 once you have taken the low hanging fruit that you identified in the due diligence you can go for projects that build shareholder value but never forget the day job
6489501 this is due to the fact that we have withdrawn from the nhs project and there have been a lot of costs involved
6489502 a lot of work was done that we have not been paid for and we have to be judicious
6489503 as yet cloning seems to be the most pressing issue however future attacks could lead to passport forgery or even modification over the air if someone could replace the photo then a forged passport could be used to beat the system
6489504 seven million vulnerable passports are being issued per year it will be a long time until new technology that prevents hacking attacks can be rolled out us e passports include a layer of foil in the lining to prevent rfid skimming attacks uk passports do not
6489505 the first thing to note is this is a trial the system has been tested in the sense that it is already used in other countries such as portugal and singapore and the system will not function as a standalone check there will still be staff making checks at the border security is something we constantly review
6489506 there is a concern that people arent really clear about the value of their unique identity
6489507 our research will engage people in current debates about privacy and consent issues find out how they think about their identity and what decisions they make we hope the discussions will provide invaluable information to help develop new identity management tools
6489508 governments and businesses around the world will make substantial investments in identity management infrastructures over the next few years
6489509 these procurements will need to inspire public confidence that issues around improving privacy and enabling informed consent have been fully integrated this research will be key to ensuring that the hardware and software required will meet public expectations about these important issues
6489510 the pressure to deliver a gold medal service during a global event such as the olympics is intense
6489511 so weve had clickschedule and clickanalyze deployed and rigorously tested since the beginning of the year
6489512 the software has met or exceeded expectations and we believe it will continue to do so throughout the olympics
6489513 if a cio understands this then it is a business enabler and not a cost and can become a competitive advantage
6489514 when there is nervousness around the economy there is more scrutiny around projects and budgets so you need a water tight business case
6489515 a good cio has a broad and informed view of business strategies and processes and has the it know how to deliver anybody with these competencies is well placed to hold on to a job in the current market
6489516 le b b et la m re porteuse vont bien
6489517 the corporations sit there in their ih in their corporation buildings and and and see thats theyre all corporationy and they make money mhm
6489518 users may wish to turn on the privacy mode if they are planning a surprise party buying presents or researching a medical condition and do not want others users of the same computer to find out
6489519 i would like wilson to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter
6489520 the dried up cum stain added thats simple anne just point to yourself
6489521 the first half of 2008 looks very different from the previous six years
6489522 the slowdown is hitting the most profitable firms the hardest
6489523 there is a silver lining a bad year and the numbers suggest 2008 will be even more trying than 2001 when partner profits were down slightly will enable firms to take steps that partners would resist in a good year winnowing out unproductive lawyers and applying greater discipline to expense control
6489524 theres a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background russia iran
6489525 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6489526 il ma pris la main ma regard e avec ce regard exceptionnel a dit lactrice je ne my attendais pas jai v cu un moment rare
6489527 it slightly feels like relief to know the two people accused of murdering my brother are not on the streets
6489528 protect consumers from the annoyance and invasion of prerecorded sales messages that seem to be increasing every day
6489529 the prerecorded message was an inexpensive way to reach customers and now youll have to use operators to reach those customers
6489530 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6489531 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6489532 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6489533 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6489534 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6489535 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6489536 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6489537 i am here to say there is nothing heroic or award winning about taking the life of an unborn child
6489538 this division is reasonable grounds on which to revoke the award
6489539 my view is that im there to make sure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against a particular candidate
6489540 were closed for six months and our customers were using other city facilities so we extended the policy and the practice to other facilities so that our customers are getting the same treatment at other facilities
6489541 i think its all about being culturally competent which is where we started from at village square leisure centre wanting to make sure that we could reflect the cultural diversity in our catchment area
6489542 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labour can she serve
6489543 but they can also be taken away at any time
6489544 we have no records of these two names in our system
6489545 this is part of the arsenal of repressive tactics that the government has used to silence dissent
6489546 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6489547 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6489548 the goal is to silence and deter them this goal has been achieved
6489549 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6489550 habib wasnt involved at all he didnt give us any instructions to attack the rally it was just our expression of disappointment
6489551 i had a idea ill tell a story once upon a time there was a little girl named emma and she stretched her arms way way out and she broked the car
6489552 emma you didnt break the car honey do you know how to drive
6489553 well honey only the person driving can break the car
6489554 i know mommy how about you tell us a story
6489555 you dont do it with your hands mommy you do it with your mouth
6489556 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves

6489609 prior to the athens games there were 26 positive tests discovered by international federations especially in weightlifting we said to the federations that they should begin their pre games testing earlier for these olympics
6489610 thus in the six weeks leading up to the games there were 39 athletes who tested positive in particular the greeks and the russians it means that there have been 39 cheats thwarted from coming to the games and affecting the results

6489883 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6489884 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
6489885 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6489886 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
6489887 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
6489888 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves
6489889 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6489890 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6489891 my husband said he was going to see his family
6489892 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6489893 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6489894 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west the support is very important for us

6489897 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
6489898 why do you think the russians are doing this in your village

6489925 no i dont because there was not control over the undie 500 anyhow
6489926 the reality is the people who organised these events had no control over who attended the event and what happened after it it was no more than a pub crawl
6489927 the opsa will expel any members guilty of violence and damage at the event
6489928 we are sick of the dunedin community and students being seen to be part of this these groups need to understand that drunken parties which predictably lead to street violence and property damage is not acceptable its just bloody stupid
6489929 this is no longer an event for entertainment value it is purely poorly organised public disorder and anyone guilty in such illegal activities should be punished to the full extent

6489933 our modelling is from a conservative basis and errs in new zealands favour but it still confirms that with new zealands current tax regime leaving money in australia would provide a better financial return
6489934 we welcome the closer alignment that makes it easier for new zealanders to reclaim their retirement savings if they choose to however the only advantage of moving money from australia back to new zealand is a desire to manage all your retirement assets in one place
6489935 if further tax changes are not made new zealand risks suffering from net migration of both capital and people to australia based on rational financial decisions we would expect net capital to flow across the tasman towards australia given the beneficial tax on investment earnings
6489936 eight years ago an incoming prime minister helen clark was reported as saying she was ashamed of the number of people leaving to live in australia
6489937 labour has squandered its opportunities to keep these people here
6489938 our view is this is not a product failure but rather a failure in getting the product into the marketplace and growing market share
6489939 weve got a sustainability policy where we want everybody operating sustainability programmes by 2012 and products such as these fit that policy
6489940 police obtained his flight details and asked the airport police to check him out at the airport
6489941 he was picked up at queenstown airport leaving with his supposedly stolen snowboard which was in fact broken
6489942 anyone whos making a false declaration whether its a lost property report or alleging theft of any property for the purpose of making an insurance claim is dealt with seriously
6489943 we want high value people and longer staying people here its worth noting the east coast of australia is a huge market for this town wed love to have pacific blue come here
6489944 we have to spend more money on marketing destination queenstown has a tiny budget compared to other tourist towns
6489945 low entry costs encouraged me too operators but there are constraints on returns on investment that check reality
6489946 this is part of a strategic review of all their operations in this part of the world plants in dunedin melbourne and hobart are to become centres for excellence
6489947 down here it is for manufacturing assortments with this kind of investment over this sort of time frame the job losses may be managed through attrition rather than a big bang
6489948 our sympathy has to be with the staff who might be made redundant when this happens people are unsettled during this difficult time
6489949 would stand by its commitments and the staff entitlements were assured
6489950 we got very late notice of the meeting and it was a bit of a shock to see how they chose to announce it in a simultaneous video cast our guys were surprised by the approach
6489951 its a two edged sword on one hand they are announcing extra capital expenditure and on another job losses that will mean less regular money going into the community which will be devastating in terms of the dunedin community

6489955 this next week is clearly a major moment in african american history and we are pleased that mrs obama is willing to share this historic time with our viewers and share her thoughts about what it means to her and her family
6489956 we also hope to have an opportunity soon to offer our viewers an in depth interview with senator mccain

6489976 i said i was going to call the police and then she went nuts she said she was going to kill me
6489977 i pushed her away and tried to climb back in the truck she slashed my arm twice as i pulled the door closed and she continued to stab the window once i was inside
6489978 now that ive had time to think about things i feel a bit freaked out about what could have happened
6489979 his first instinct was to protect his boy then his next instinct was to go back to the nursery and make sure that everyone knew of the danger were very proud of him
6489980 the only thing i was worrying about was my son and the other folks
6489981 im just stoked it happened to me and not a mother if she had taken to a mother she could have killed them she could have killed me
6489982 im pleased the whole thing played out out of my sons view
6489983 i think the situation could have been a lot more serious if he the father hadnt done what he did
6489984 scary stuff i wasnt going to drop the kids off after that but other parents were at least it was a strong dad attacked not one of the pregnant mums
