8420366 it was just so painful watching him pass away my little brother i was supposed to take care of him and watch over him i just felt so helpless seeing him like that
8420367 it was a question about timing in the house i knew that yesterday was the day some weeks ago

8420371 im concerned that we attempt to put almost all new zealand police officers into a trained situation so that at the drop of a hat they may have to exercise the fine judgments that an officer has to in relation to a threat coming from someone and potentially use lethal force firearms guns

8420373 it would not matter if it was posted its an unenforceable policy and in violation of the constitution they so dearly think they are protecting
8420374 using uniformed nypd cops to enforce those same policies changes everything the strong arm tactics employed by the police here constitutes state action

8420408 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8420409 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8420410 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8420411 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8420412 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8420413 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity

8420415 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong

8420467 i think its going to work out great they want to submerge themselves in a place thats the opposite of where theyre from and what theyre used to i think were just going to start by doing a couple of tracks no pressure the goal is to make something that they dig so much that everyone else can too
8420468 i havent heard much about it 99 percent of us stay away from the tv
8420469 biden is a 35 year senate veteran who offers qualities obama conspicuously lacks decades of experience foreign policy depth and a refreshingly direct style that contrasts well with obamas nuanced reserve instead of an outside the box pick that would have electrified supporters enamored with his change agent style obama chose a solid member of the democratic establishment who fills the holes in his resume
8420470 biden brings a blue collar sensibility that has been lacking in obamas campaign
8420471 the message he surely has brought to obama is your background looks elitist to many of the people i represent the way to overcome that impression is to be in their neighborhoods talk directly to them in small groups and show them you really understand the struggles in their lives biden surely does that
8420472 in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions the question is whether bidens depth counters obamas inexperience or highlights it
8420473 when you pick a running mate to correct a defect in your resume as has happened in this case you underscore the defect now the thinness of mr obamas resume in foreign policy is as clear as putty
8420474 bidens selection represents an implied admission by obama that he lacks what biden has foreign policy credentials
8420475 biden was chosen because in the end he satisfied obamas apparent desire if not need to reassure those who wonder about his youth his race his manner his peripatetic childhood on the stump obama did not need someone like himself he felt the need for someone more rooted
8420476 although he initially voted to authorize the war mr obama has opposed the war from the start mr biden has become a persistent critic of president bushs policies in iraq mr biden would complement mr obamas antiwar position in the general election match up against senator john mccain the likely republican nominee who has supported the war
8420477 biden brings a lot to the table an expert on national security the delaware senator voted in 2002 to authorize military intervention in iraq but has since become a vocal critic of the conflict
8420478 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8420479 theres less than 1 percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is it in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
8420480 you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
8420481 biden has an unpublicized side as an urban politician his imprint has been heavy on all the anti crime legislation passed in the past two decades and his civil rights credentials are impeccable
8420482 if joe biden were sitting at this table wed all be having a wonderful time with him hes a nice guy hes fun to be with one of the reasons he gets in trouble is because he does speak frankly to us and to the american people which sometimes is a problem for him
8420483 joe bidens stereotyping indian americans at a convenience store or calling obama clean and articulate did no lasting harm because no one ever accused biden of being a racist stories dont grow in barren soil
8420484 we see somebody down and out we care for them
8420485 to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest
8420486 barack obama is the only person in this race who understands that that before we can work on the problems we have to fix our souls our souls are broken in this nation
8420487 america needs positive optimistic leadership to kind of turn this country around to see a revival of our national soul
8420488 polities that attempt to shape the souls of their citizenry and foster certain excellences or moral qualities by penetrating deeply into the private sphere the founders wanted their government to be limited to establishing and securing such a sphere
8420489 look at the faces not of the candidates but of the rope liners themselves with arms and fingers extended their eyes bugged and sometimes tearful
8420490 at times like this the president takes off his cap as commander in chief and puts on the robes of consoler in chief
8420491 have a deep connection with the needs anxieties dreams of the people
8420492 ultimately american purpose can find its voice only in washington without vigorous national vision we are plagued by anxiety and disquiet
8420493 when we fight against drugs we fight for the souls of our fellow americans

8420501 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married she added i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8420502 martin and lyon exchanged vows at san francisco city hall on june 16 the first day same sex couples could legally wed in california after being together for more than half a century
8420503 in preseason they have to play and get ready to go but you just kind of hold your breath all the time
8420504 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8420505 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8420506 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8420507 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8420508 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8420509 25 000 marines in the province are probably being in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8420510 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8420511 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
8420512 guatemala no protection no justice killings of women in guatemala
8420513 the brutality of the killings reveal that extreme forms of sexual violence and discrimination remain prevalent in guatemalan society
8420514 power inequality between men and women in the social economic legal political cultural and family spheres
8420515 forced prostitution and denying a woman the right to use contraceptive methods whether natural or hormonal or taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections
8420516 the discussions previous to the approval of the law made it clear that the dominant macho culture in guatemala will make it difficult to implement the law
8420517 explain the law to women organizations just as they have already done to the judiciary police public health sector and army
8420518 this bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of mankind
8420519 the american people expect their government to work tirelessly to make sure consumer products are safe and that is precisely what my administration is doing
8420520 told us theres no money for this and the white house wants to cut it
8420521 we are trying to open up our beef trade with china
8420522 the chinese always say that they want the us to import chinese poultry in exchange for us beef
8420523 grease blood fat pieces of dry meat and foreign particles
8420524 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands
8420525 since presenting our first offer weve spent a great deal of time meeting with the iam to focus on their contract priorities
8420526 we have made substantial movement in pay pension and health care weve withdrawn key proposals that were important to the company but of concern to the union we have been negotiating for more than four months weve had a thorough discussion of all of the issues and we are near the point of presenting a best and final offer that rewards boeing employees for their great work while allowing the company to sustain our success in the future
8420527 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8420528 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8420529 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8420530 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy
8420531 on this january night at this defining moment in history you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8420532 years from now youll look back and youll say that this was the moment this was the place where america remembered what it means to hope
8420533 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do
8420534 i feel really happy that i even got a perimeter pass

8420536 i mean some people do have access to inside the hall thats where the excitement is
8420537 im just happy that i had a chance to be a part of this and i look forward to obamas speech
8420538 but i cant complain i didnt sign up to get inside i wasnt expecting it
8420539 underneath denis is still that boy that genuinely loves video games with a passion
8420540 denis is sincerely passionate about the quality of everything silicon knights does and with that passion comes some of his outspokenness and desire to interact with the community one of my favorite denis stories is when we met to discuss eternal darkness when i was working at nintendo a few of us got together went out for dinner and then ended up at an arcade just playing games for hours while we talked about ideas it was incredibly refreshing and exciting to see all of the passion he had about making games and still act like a gamer and have fun
8420541 one of the things i like about denis is that he is a tenacious person and he takes risks i respect him for that because im the same way i never give up and if you dont take risks you are never going to know your potential i know that if it were not for denis we wouldnt be having this conversation right now because sk wouldnt exist

8420547 backstretch workers are truly the unsung heroes of new yorks horse racing industry this investigation presents us with both a legal and moral opportunity to change an entire culture within this industry for the better

8420557 as an actress its so easy to be passive in your career just waiting around for somebody to give you a ring and tell you to show up on set in a week or not
8420558 i thought we know what happens to actresses in their 40s and 50s

8420570 after setting forth our capital and credit plan august 8 we are now putting a senior management structure in place to drive this plan across the company
8420571 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the us housing and mortgage markets as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities and we have to organize and staff accordingly

8420583 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running in order to oversee the production process in order to validate that the controls are indeed in place
8420584 its tantamount to if you had a haystack with a needle in it

8420586 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8420587 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8420588 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions

8420590 voters naturally associate election day with casting their ballots forgetting that as overseas or military absentee voters they need to file their registration ballot request paperwork each election year usually 30 days in advance to receive their absentee ballot

8420658 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities i mean at the end of the day we are talking about the future borders of the palestinian state considering more than 40 years we are talking plus minus about the same blocks of settlements and this is part of the negotiations and as i suggested also to my co partners on the palestinian side to try and i understand that sometimes inaudible and sometimes how does it affect on different parts of palestinian society but at the end of the day the role of leaders is to try and find a way to live in peace in the future and to avoid any kind of not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiations room i mean it could have been easier also for me to use some excuses and to say that this affects my ability to negotiate but i decided not to do so even in harder days of terror so i would like to suggest my co partners not to use it as an excuse and i know that they are not using it as an excuse but i understand the frustration sometimes

8420780 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
8420781 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
8420782 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
8420783 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
8420784 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
8420785 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
8420786 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
8420787 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
8420788 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
8420789 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
8420790 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
8420791 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
8420792 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
8420793 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
8420794 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
8420795 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
8420796 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
8420797 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
8420798 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
8420799 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
8420800 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
8420801 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
8420802 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
8420803 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
8420804 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
8420805 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
8420806 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
8420807 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
8420808 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8420809 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
8420810 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
8420811 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

8420816 this award is tangible evidence of how we support our representatives in the building of the equity in their practices in terms of marketing valuation and succession planning
8420817 although we have seen some easing in energy costs over the past few weeks energy costs remain at unprecedented levels
8420818 in this environment we must increase our conversion pricing and will offer an energy surcharge as one pricing option for our customers we believe this surcharge indexed to published doe energy cost data is a fair approach to dealing with this volatile situation however we realize that it will not suit all customers circumstances
8420819 the ad plays an important role in the public debate by educating the general public about solutions to the problem

8420821 get this one iran is changing its cars to run on natural gas and were not doing a thing here theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel we can switch our cars to natural gas and stop sending our dollars to foreign countries
8420822 to deny this advertisement is to deny americans from their fundamental right to information and the ability to make their own decisions we hope you will reconsider your decision and that you will decide to allow this advertisement to appear on nbc as soon as possible

8420880 a delicate infant born late in the autumn will not generally derive advantage from being carried into the open air in this climate till the succeeding spring and if the rooms in which he is kept are large often changed and well ventilated he will not suffer from the confinement while he will most probably escape catarrhal affections which are so often the consequence of the injudicious exposure of infants to a cold and humid atmosphere
8420881 in the approach of an attack of croup which almost always takes place in the evening probably of a day during which the child has been exposed to the weather and often after catarrhal symptoms have existed for several days he may be observed to be excited in variable spirits more ready than usual to laugh than to cry a little flushed occasionally coughing the sound of the cough being rough like that which attends the catarrhal stage of the measles more generally however the patient has been for some time in bed and asleep before the nature of the disease with which he is threatened is apparent then perhaps without waking he gives a very unusual cough well known to any one who has witnessed an attack of the croup it rings as if the child had coughed through a brazen trumpet it is truly a tussis clangosa it penetrates the walls and floor of the apartment and startles the experienced mother oh i am afraid our child is taking the croup she runs to the nursery finds her child sleeping softly and hopes she may be mistaken but remaining to tend him before long the ringing cough a single cough is repeated again and again the patient is roused and then a new symptom is remarked the sound of his voice is changed puling and as if the throat were swelled it corresponds with the cough

8420927 and trying to tell them that he would leave peacefully if they let him go
8420928 the guard walked up to reich and said what the fuck do you think youre filming and grabbed at the camera
8420929 that shits going to be on youtube we gotta get that tape
8420930 hes running through traffic dodging cars on peoples hoods as two guards are chasing him
8420931 hes saying please help me please help me with two or three security guards running through traffic trying to catch him
8420932 they were running after him saying thats the guy with the camera
8420933 i cut across and headed that way thinking he will prevent these guys from taking my tape
8420934 i knew that then at least wed be able to get the tape later
8420935 i figured theres no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop
8420936 it landed within five feet of me i leaned down to pick it up and i got tackled by two of the dudes they threw me into that ivy covered wall and i was trying to get them off me at one point there were three guards on me i threw the tape to sean and thats when it got really ugly
8420937 he hurled him into it then threw him onto the ground at this point there are two are three officers there
8420938 they beat the shit out of him in front of a cop
8420939 i am not going to give you evidence to help you back up your story
8420940 supposed to help during the immediacy of an incident and are directed to contact on duty officers if it is determined to be necessary
8420941 theyre basically to stay within the venue itself and if anything rises to the level of serious incident they are to contact the police
8420942 chinas domestic economy is suffering from unstable global factors increasing challenges and hardships
8420943 chinas top priorities for macroeconomic control in the second half have become maintaining stable but rapid economic growth and controlling excessive rises in prices this is signalling that chinas government has become more cautious on macroeconomic controls and monetary policy shouldnt be so tight in the future

8420945 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8420946 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8420947 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8420948 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8420949 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8420950 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8420951 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend
8420952 a friend of mine just recently came back to iraq and when i asked him about his journey from baghdad to najaf he told me about a very interesting conversation he had with the driver
8420953 the law was created so an officer can enlist the help of bystanders to help them control a situation or to help them in their duties now the bystander is then allowed to intervene under the authority of the officer to help them
8420954 obviously if you dont know how to do what the officers asking you cant do it and youre not expected to but to not become involved when youre asked is a misdemeanor crime because its a part of your civic duty its also is an officer is asking for your assistance there must be a reason for it
8420955 the list is really quite large lets focus on certain things immediately we know theres a lot ahead to turn attention to in the longer run
8420956 undercover officer met the suspect in the parking lot at johns foods in dodge center and the transaction at that time was being completed
8420957 and took off and at that time when the officer was knocked to the down another officer that was responding drew his weapon and fired shots at the suspect
8420958 and i got up close and it was quite quite eerie and quite shocking to see all the police and all the people and that it wasnt good
8420959 something covered up with brown so it seemed like someone had died
8420960 certainly a lot of questions come into my mind like how long had that been going on and i didnt know and how these operations can go wrong
8420961 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8420962 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8420963 yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8420964 russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago
8420965 europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8420966 the georgian economy has continued functioning more or less as normal the financial system kept functioning the exchange rate has held up the consumers have kept consuming
8420967 i was stunned and felt totally bemused my driveway only slopes down by about an inch
8420968 i told them that one of their employees was suing a customer and they just said they couldnt help
8420969 postmodernism is a change or be changed world the word is out reinvent yourself for the 21st century or die some would rather die than change
8420970 it is my submission that that has not been proved certainly not to the criminal standard and that a doubt based on reason exists
8420971 jose hernandez theres evidence before this court to conclude has no accent he speaks like a canadian born young man because thats what he is
8420972 colours all of the rest of the evidence which the crown proffered in support of the theory that mr hernandez is the speaker overheard by mr mcmynn
8420973 what he actually did was set himself up as a quartermaster of terrorism
8420974 momin khawaja was prepared to provide and metaphorically pull the trigger of a very powerful weapon
8420975 momin khawajas commitment to violent jihad was all consuming and not one dimensional
8420976 for him to pretend to be surprised or caught off guard is disingenuous in the extreme
8420977 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8420978 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another
8420979 there is the time for everything timing is everything and this is the time to finally speak up
8420980 kung kami lahat ang target sana pinatay na kaming lahat pero yung mga nasa harapan lang yung pinagbabaril
8420981 it was a question about timing in the house i knew that yesterday was the day some weeks ago
8420982 there was an intention to do it earlier but it conflicted as i understand it with some other events happening around parliament at the time
8420983 as i understand the conventions that exist it was quite proper for me to seek input
8420984 i was not asking for the ministers approval i wasnt asking for a serious piece of advice i was asking for input and her perspective which is quite different from what some have cast the relationship to be
8420985 im concerned that we attempt to put almost all new zealand police officers into a trained situation so that at the drop of a hat they may have to exercise the fine judgments that an officer has to in relation to a threat coming from someone and potentially use lethal force firearms guns

8420992 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people

8421000 next was death on mars they added the pony girl club myspace a while ago so i had already listened to them yeah big surprise there sometimes i actually listen to the bands that add us they are pretty good and i would be willing to see them again especially since they are playing the leucadian on the 18th everyone knows how sketchy the leucadian is but everyone also knows the saloon is down the street
8421001 if i could use any terms i wanted and assume that everyone understood them i could get even shorter
8421002 everyone who came out today had a fantastic time many more people came along than we had expected and it was perfect opportunity to welcome the medallists back i think people will be talking about it for quite a long time
8421003 the huge turn out at the royal mile a sign of how proud edinburgh people are of our athletes and of the massive impact that chris hoy has made on the global stage
8421004 the scottish governments overriding priority is to see an increase in sporting participation rates throughout scotland and the success of our four medallists can only be a major influence on our young people and help inspire the heroes of tomorrow
8421005 team gb had a fantastic games and we are very proud of all the athletes including the 32 scots in the team the achievements of the four scottish medallists will hopefully inspire and motivate our young people to take part in sport and physical activity and engender the belief that they too can succeed
8421006 ogni anno ha spiegato ermete realacci ministro dellambiente del governo ombra del pd che a fine giugno aveva presentato uninterrogazione parlamentare sul tema vengono segnalati un numero crescente di casi di morie di intere colonie di api e sarebbe un errore pensare a questo fenomeno come un problema che riguarda solo gli insetti e gli apicoltori le api infatti oltre a rappresentare un indicatore molto sensibile dellequilibrio ambientale contribuiscono per l80 allimpollinazione delle coltivazioni che costituiscono un terzo della nostra alimentazione per un valore stimato pari a 2 5 miliardi di euro allanno in italia e ben 10 miliardi di euro allanno nel mondo oltre che la maggior parte delle piante da frutto dipendono dallazione impollinatrice delle api anche la produzione delle colture foraggere fondamentali per i prati destinati agli animali da allevamento
8421007 la procedura attivata dal ministero dellagricoltura ha spiegato andrea terreni vicepresidente di unaapi dopo la riunione del 30 luglio tesa ad acquisire ulteriori pareri tecnico scientifici per avviare la pratica di sospensione dellautorizzazione delluso dei neonicotinoidi assolutamente insoddisfacente il ministero ha gi in mano tutti gli elementi di conoscenza per prendere una motivata decisione di sospensiva ogni ulteriore ritardo comporter il ripetersi dei fenomeni di morie anche nel 2009 e noto infatti che le industrie sementiere nelle prossime settimane produrranno le sementi per la prossima stagione e in assenza di un immediato provvedimento da parte del ministero lo faranno utilizzando nuovamente le conce con i neonicotinoidi basta con le tattiche dilatorie chiediamo una decisione immediata
8421008 la francia che rimane il primo paese europeo produttore di mais ha messo al bando da tempo i pesticidi ritenuti responsabili della moria delle api recentemente e senza troppi indugi la stessa germania il paese della bayer e la slovenia hanno deciso di sospendere luso delle molecole incriminate perch hanno riscontrato una spaventosa impennata dei decessi in conseguenza ai trattamenti con gli agrofarmaci e ora che si riveda radicalmente la procedura dautorizzazione dei prodotti fitosanitari ha rivendicato hubert ciacci presidente della s g a non ci si pu limitare alla constatazione degli effetti a breve periodo di mortalit acuta ma occorre studiare leffetto delle molecole sia singolarmente e sia in sinergia tra loro sulle api e sulla vita nel tempo e secondo tutte le variabili possibili e giunta lora che vengano considerate tutte le fonti di approvvigionamento delle api quali lacqua e il polline in primis quello del mais
8421009 litalia uno dei paesi che eccellono per la tipicit e la qualit dei mieli sempre pi spesso spese come attrattiva nel turismo eno gastronomico ha dichiarato piero baronti presidente di legambiente toscana nonostante le evidenze sulla minaccia alla sopravvivenza delle api comportata dallutilizzo dei neonicotinoidi si continua a ritardare la messa al bando di questi veleni volendo ancora approfondire
8421010 se lape scomparisse dalla faccia della terra alluomo non resterebbero che quattro anni di vita

8421025 we were on a track car and were headed down across esbenshade crossing
8421026 we were going down through groundhog cut and the weeds were so thick you just couldnt see the track
8421027 the people just came in droves i mean they were discovering lancaster county and we were one of the few things to do in lancaster county
8421028 i am very happy that i was able to finish first at wcg germany before the games started i was under pressure because i was one of the favorites and my personal goal was to make the grand final in the first match i had to beat mossos i knew mossos did not expect to win the match but this was dangerous for me because he had nothing to lose i beat mossos in two games and then met deto in the following round i have never beaten deto in a important match and i knew that it will be a hard match finally we had to go in penalty shoot out and i came out the lucky one in the 3rd round i got zooky and i was very concentrated because this game decided who gets the ticket for the grand final after losing the first match i refused to give up and i won the next two games which got qualified and very satisfied in the overall final i had to beat bvbstar two times and after five games i was the winner of the wcg national finals
8421029 we have been monitoring traffic for a long time and trends dont just happen for no reason in the past six months congestion has eased quite significantly the credit crunch is clearly the reason for that
8421030 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at slower and more economical speeds
8421031 part of the reason for these decreases is simply that there are fewer cars on the road as the price of fuel is making it too expensive for people to drive
8421032 peoples budgets are being squeezed and what is happening is that they are changing their driving habits while they are not necessarily getting rid of their cars they arent driving as often or they are perhaps car sharing to save money
8421033 the figures show that congestion has steadily continued to ease over the past six months it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next year or so because the credit crunch looks like its going to continue
8421034 it is true that people appear to be aware of what is known as eco driving they realise that if they drive slower they will be able to make a tank of fuel go that bit further its quite sensible when you consider most people will be paying upwards of 60 for a tank of fuel
8421035 it does not surprise me in the least to hear that the price of fuel and the countrys economic situation is driving people off the road i think that what is happening is that people are continuing to make necessary journeys but they are cutting down on social driving
8421036 im trying to find a way to drive people to our products that may not be looking for a new vendor
8421037 when you do google or yahoo ads youre only going to get people looking for a change youre not going to reach people who are happy with their product
8421038 that was really a flag to me that we were not reaching the market and they were not aware that were selling these products
8421039 were pretty excited about that because this tends to be a recurring purchase
8421040 every switch thats sold you need an sfp and when you need to upgrade your networks you need new sfps
8421041 were getting some nice results and are already at breakeven for what costs are
8421042 we figure weve got mind share with these people and expect to see recurring revenue down the road
8421043 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8421044 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8421045 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8421046 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8421047 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation

8421055 doch eine freundin bat mich nicht mitzukommen weil die fotografen horden allen total auf den wecker gingen
8421056 ich mache meinen freunden keinen vorwurf die paparazzi k nnen schon sehr einsch chternd wirken
8421057 teneinde de paleo hegemonische en post moderne overheersing van de witte man en zijn post koloniale plantagementaliteit verradende witte mans humor te devitaliseren kies ik ervoor de witte man niet op zijn paleo fundamentalistische handenschuddogmas te endorsen liever kies ik voor het entameren van een militante contrahegemonische vrijheidsstrijd militant maar zonder geweld althans niet het zicht van de sterke arm van de witte mans wet die ondanks mijn opleiding tot witte mans jurist nooit tot het palet van mijn oprecht gekoesterde wetsovertuigingen zal behoren in mijn militante strijd tegen de witte mans handenschudfundamentalisten zijn de 9 erogene zones van het vrouwenlichaam mij als een allahsgeschenk te hulp geschoten en fourneren mij de verschoning dat het refuseren van het geven van een hand eerder normaal dan abnormaal is tenzij men de op zich helige daad der cohabitatie tussen man en vrouw in de publieke ruimte zou willen gedogen danwel endorsen maar zover mij bekend is zelfs de meest liberale paleo hegemonische witte man hier niet van gediend danwel gecharmeerd en dus zijn de 9 erogene zones door allah op het vrouwenlichaam aangebracht mijn ultieme strijdmakkers in de militante contrahegemonische dubbele en dus verborgen agenda om de witte mans handeschudfundamentalisten op hun eigen contingent te defibibrileren en uiteindelijk de devitaliseren
8421058 yes its not apart vocab but i find myself using it here sometimes to make a point most times silly but never the less a point
8421059 yes i never use that word it disgust me when i hear black people using it
8421060 i only use the term n a to refer to n s if you dont act like a n a i call you bruh sis
8421061 n a ill stop saying it as soon as you stop asking stupid questions
8421062 its actually pretty easy i have not really used it at all since 10th grade i rarely use it even when to describe those who fit the description much like what name edited briefly spoke about
8421063 the word n er is probably the last word our beaten ancestors heard not n a i have come to terms with the word being different than its predecessor i feel that it is what it is a word that can and should only be used by blacks i feel we should be able to use the word in any demeanor we want why because it is the only thing that we can call our own it is the only thing we have left that makes us family or being from the same clan that ties all blacks that are descendants of slaves together
8421064 if you have an extensive vocabulary its prety easy i dont have a need to use it rally kinda sad that people feel the need to say it in order to fit in
8421065 yes i do it everyday i personally detest the word and the history behind it
8421066 n s are real n s are everywhere i dont call a black person a n a i call n s n s when n s deserve the n a tag i encounter n s everyday and they will continue to be called n a so they can see the n a in their ways and strive to not be like n s one day
8421067 the word dont bother me unless someone of another race say it cause its no purpose for them to say it
8421068 black folx been saying n a for yrs this aint a new thing why sweat the small stuff
8421069 nope i aint got no reason to go without saying
8421070 i stopped using that word 2 years ago after seeing this documentary about the klu klux klan on th history channel im sure it wouldnt change everybody but it did change me
8421071 a few phrases come to mind when seeing this topic its not what you are called its what you answer to one bullet wont kill a million people can i go a day without using it sure i do all the time often when it is only myself and my son at home the only time that word gets used is in a song from my itunes i use words that are appropriate to the conversation that i am having and if nigga is appropriate then nigga gets used was the word employed as a tool to keep us down absolutely but so was economic illiteracy and a placate over prosper attitude when the fuck does the fight start against those
8421072 lets all turn the word b h into a word we can call people and our friends smh
8421073 i say n a to my n s and people i feel are cool
8421074 im not chinese caucasion or puerto rican so i dont know what slang their people use on the regular
8421075 what this really boils down to is the 2 generations that preceded this one fought to eliminate terms like this they also had to fight for the right to be treated as humans they did a damn good job too good this present generation has fought for nothing this generation inherited the same rights others died for and this is where the confusion starts the loss of self pride since this generation has fought for nothing they lack appreciation for the very rights they now enjoy no appreciation for the sacrifices their very own mothers fathers aunts and uncles and grandparents made to make their lives better see when you dont make or have to make the sacrifice you dont appreciate what you have what happened to black pride we were once proud brothers and sisters we need to get back to that when im dealing with a brother or sister i usually know where theyre coming from ive never really known what to expect from a nigga i do know the sacrifices made by those who put it on the line didnt risk it all just to have their children think of themselves as n s
8421076 out of respect for all of those that were oppressed and forcibly made to accept being called one i try my hardest to not use it as a regular part of my speech thats not to say that i dont use it but i keep its usage very limited
8421077 has been going on for a number of years now
8421078 first off its not the way its supposed to be
8421079 were supposed to get new staff cleared in a timely fashion in the meantime we buddy them with someone who does have clearance but in the end it really does hamstring your programming no matter what
8421080 and they have to be renewed every five years so maybe i should apply for mine now because it might take five years to get it done
8421081 it does create a lot of challenges for those who have to have it and how do you deal with the situation of mandatory checks versus optional ones
8421082 and what do you do in the meantime shut your business down
8421083 i became aware of the problem tuesday morning and contacted the rcmp about it
8421084 we are going to be very careful about short circuiting these requirements when it comes to dealing with children
8421085 youll have to contact the departments to find out which positions require the check
8421086 in many respects conservatives would be smart to let mccain pick someone like lieberman giuliani or ridge simply because they would not likely seek the republican nomination if mccain does not run for a second term
8421087 well i didnt really believe in anything the administration did trust me
8421088 why hasnt the movement taken one key issue or a few and put their full might behind them
8421089 durable goods orders were up very nicely and the market is going up because that has helped people start to look beyond the valley of all the economic and credit concerns to better times ahead
8421090 what we are looking for is to be able to say weve found a trough
8421091 but if thats so we can still meander around for a while so i wouldnt get too excited yet
8421092 cada semana nos ponemos a prueba los entrenadores a nivel general la clasificaci n para la liga de campeones es una enorme alegr a por esta afici n y por esta gente que est muy entregada y que merece que les di semos una satisfacci n
8421093 el primer a o me dijeron que hab a que ir a uefa y fue por intertoto y sufrimos como animales y el segundo me dijeron que hab a que acabar entre los cuatro primeros me quito un peso de encima porque por lo menos entregamos los que nos pidieron cumplimos esto es de la temporada pasada
8421094 era un partido en el que todos nos ten amos que dejar la piel estoy muy contento por mis jugadores porque lo han trabajado y lo han sufrido mucho y por mi cuerpo t cnico sin ellos no habr a sido posible y por toda la gente que nos rodea que nos aporta su optimismo y su trabajo
8421095 dont blame yourself knowing that he wants to feel guilty
8421096 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
8421097 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8421098 the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8421099 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8421100 there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
8421101 we approach projects with an interest in building the complete fan experience
8421102 we want fans and visitors to feel at home and connected to their team by offering settings and menus that reflect local flavor and make a visit to the stadium more special
8421103 what do you want me to use on it then

8421106 the contractor will be out there just as quickly as possible were moving
8421107 there will always be some opposition but the majority of the residents in bonner county have been very supportive and its time to move forward with this
8421108 schoolchildren studying literature in the colonies had to navigate cockney speech patterns imagine for themselves what toad in the hole might taste like picture moors and bogs and fens and determine the emotional significance of each of these landscapes now we get to tell our own stories and this requires your dealing with my rubber estates and char kuay teow and cursing in tamil in the long run this will be good for all of us a little cultural immersion never did anyone any harm
8421109 i feel the very concept of the hero has become trite and outmoded todays high powered world is too sophisticated too complicated simply too dangerous for such an outdated notion as the heroic ideal its time we put all such childish notions behind us
8421110 see this is where this delicious food used to be
8421111 those two add up to a little more than we normally would have
8421112 woah ch rie aurais tu suc un cadavre en d composition avant de te coucher sans te brosser les dents

8421114 tiens jai tromp ma femme avec une gonzesse plus moche quelle je suis trop con moi je boirai plus jamais promis
8421115 in this corner from the great state of blah blah blah weighing in at a cool 130 pounds is senator blah blah blah rahhhhhh
8421116 ive gone to meetings where people have been downright hostile to me people that i poll 90 percent positive with turn on me when i try to defend sen obama
8421117 i want everyone to leave here realizing that we have a significant issue that has to be addressed in the next few weeks if were going to have any chance of getting florida in the blue column
8421118 were hoping that this is starting to change peoples perceptions but it hasnt done so yet
8421119 the jewish community in southern florida is solidly behind barack obama
8421120 i dont think anybody has their head in the sand

8421126 ive just felt a gust of warm air up my back
8421127 animation techniques for controlling passive simulation are commonly based on an optimization paradigm the user provides goals a priori and sophisticated numerical methods minimize a cost function that represents these goals unfortunately for multibody systemswith discontinuous contact events these optimization problems can be highly nontrivial to solve andmany hour offline optimizations unintuitive parameters and convergence failures can frustrate end users and limit usage on the other hand users are quite adaptable and systems which provide interactive feedback via an intuitive interface can leverage the users own abilities to quickly produce interesting animations however the online computation necessary for interactivity limits scene complexity in practice this thesis presents two methods for controlling the rigid body simulations the first is many worlds browsing a method which exploits the speed of multibody simulators to compute numerous simulations in parallel offline and online and allow the user to browse and modify them interactively by bolting responsive powerful intuitive interfaces onto relatively simple sampling techniques we get a method that enables animators to produce compelling results with a minimum of effort the second method is time reversed simulation we provide only the final resting configuration of the system and run the simulator backwards in time during the development of this method we encountered a number of surprisingly counter intuitive results which can be elucidated using a combination of numerical simulation and thought experiments
8421128 but down there in the well where there is no light and a only a thousand year old water
8421129 they have greys anatomy scrubs is it weird that i want some i have a vision of me in them watching the show

8421158 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8421159 you can slow a picture down so much that you can see the grains of sand and the clay around the bag you can see whether or not a person has shaved that day
8421160 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8421161 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8421162 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed

8421165 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8421166 but we dont expect anybody is going to impact the game in that fashion if it were true that something like that did happen wed impact them very quickly from the commissioners office without a doubt but we dont have that fear not at all everybodys going to want to show the play
8421167 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8421168 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8421169 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8421170 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8421171 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8421172 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8421173 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8421174 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8421175 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore

8421183 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the final four after their four years at duke then thats just too damn bad
8421184 but our team is going to have fun is going to be representative and theyre going to have the opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8421185 the cpp is now trying to govern alone and keep partner positions in secretary and undersecretary slots and some provincial governors only
8421186 the new government will be more dynamic in tourism agriculture industry petroleum construction services and investment
8421187 it will be a great danger and the country will fall into the communist system
8421188 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8421189 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training and just looking forward to the meeting
8421190 i know the celebrations will wait till i get home so im not worried
8421191 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8421192 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8421193 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8421194 it is a good thing i am doing i hope other people see that
8421195 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8421196 if you did track and field you should know that i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8421197 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8421198 i have been to eight olympics and i have seen celebration of all kinds i was in seoul and flo jo was running the last 20 metres with her hand waving in front of the other competitors nobody said anything
8421199 i think the comments are unfair and that there was a certain amount of targeting
8421200 if they are trying to get in his mind they are wasting their time
8421201 i havent set any goals for the rest of the season
8421202 just try to get through the season injury free and go home and enjoy myself
8421203 im not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give michael madigan a hug
8421204 look whenever you hug a guy you ought to be upbeat about it
8421205 i just wonder if its the altitude well find out when we get back home
8421206 a hug a dance a wink a nod these guys have been doing the two step for five years
8421207 theres more to do and i like my job and i have no reason to think i dont want to keep doing this job
8421208 so i dont know whether it is genuine or not
8421209 theres a difference in approach weve applied a common sense approach thats the way mike madigans done it for more than two decades and thats the way its going to continue
8421210 i think were focused on the november elections and barack obama
8421211 while similar in nature these burglaries were committed in a manner that is quite common so connecting them to one offender would be difficult at this time
8421212 if i were that person id step right into that car and lock the doors and start
8421213 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
8421214 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
8421215 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
8421216 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
8421217 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
8421218 i celebrate christmas but because it isnt celebrated by everyone we can no longer say merry christmas now it has to be seasons greetings its not christmas vacation its winter break isnt it amazing how this winter break always occurs over the christmas holiday weve gone so far the other way bent over backwards to not offend anyone that i am now being offended but it seems that no one has a problem with that i am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture since the terrorist attacks on sept 11 we have experienced a surge in patriotism by a majority of americans however the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the politically correct
8421219 as a small token of our appreciation for everyone who has heard the call over the years
8421220 we were conscious that with the attack on the world trade center invaders was revisiting an event that had occurred not too distantly in the past and that therefore represented a controversial subject
8421221 the work was not an attempt to provoke controversy for controversys sake but an invitation to reflect made in a distinctive manner
8421222 in a holy alliance with dapper grooming 27 n scott father larry has expanded to the church of rock revelation featuring the master of ceremonies father larry and deacon mike d and the right reverend tacklebox
8421223 the most likely scenario is that we will absorb some of their employees into the rexburg police department

8421233 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8421234 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8421235 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8421236 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8421237 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you

8421246 he came here on an emergency basis to help us and he did but hes a starting pitcher hes not really a left handed reliever
8421247 hes a young guy and hes had a full year
8421248 theres probably nothing wrong with him not pitching a whole lot more either
8421249 were in a good position ending the season off so we have to come back ready to go and i think were ready to do that
8421250 were going to focus on one game at a time and just try and get better each day
8421251 not so much as looking at us getting back on a roll but just playing good solid basketball were going to worry about ourselves take care of the little things

8421307 ok so im the office leader now what do i do
8421308 we know from prior experience that the current slowdown in the visitor market will eventually turn around but we dont want to just wait for that to happen
8421309 we want to do something now and i appreciate the hotel industrys willingness to work together on finding innovative solutions to bolster our tourism market
8421310 rather than dwell on the challenges facing the industry and our economy these industry leaders are looking forward
8421311 prior to june and july hawaiis visitor market had managed to weather the softness that was being felt by other travel destination as a result of the slowing national economy
8421312 july was the second month we have seen a significant impact on the visitor industry due to a variety of factors including the national economy rising fuel prices and the loss of the two norwegian cruise line ships
8421313 we are excited to welcome mr crippen to his leadership role at oai mr crippens depth of airline experience and background will complement the existing strong senior management team
8421314 the drive market has helped the cruise lines overcome economic obstacles
8421315 and theyre capitalizing on the fact that the airlines are cutting capacity and raising prices
8421316 the port with all the cruise business its developing really helps us
8421317 the cruise business is an important part of our tourism industry because it drives hotel stays before and after the cruise
8421318 one of the reasons were doing so well with cruising is that people just dont want to fly
8421319 were located within driving distance of many states along the east coast and well into the ohio valley and cruising has become a better option than flying
8421320 the cruise industry is doing well because people are driving to their ports
8421321 there are a lot of local ports around the country and cruising is more of an option than ever before also people enjoy the convenience in that they can unpack once
8421322 all the cruise lines are focusing on the drive market
8421323 we strongly advise against all travel to high density low income suburban areas at any time and all but essential travel to rural mashonaland rural manicaland and farming areas there have been a number of serious incidents in rural areas and it is dangerous for farmers or agricultural workers to visit former properties or other agricultural areas you should also avoid areas where war veterans are active the situation remains unpredictable and incidents of violence across the country continue it could deteriorate further without warning
8421324 every performance needs a little blood i look forward to seeing the fighters get roughed up a bit
8421325 chanting music no electric lighting the whole atmosphere was one of sedation
8421326 the college needs to take more drastic action than it has to date the vincentians should withdraw themselves from the governing council of the college while the investigation is ongoing

8421329 the threat of cannibalization appears to be considerably lower than widely assumed the internet rarely cannibalizes traditional channels
8421330 in robert yorio and cory springer theyve got the same team that sued both and apple for copyright infringement on behalf of burst com and reportedly extracted significant settlements from both
8421331 it is not generally unfair for a company to keep their product private
8421332 the antitrust laws are geared to encouraging competition antitrust violations generally concern business behavior that is deemed societally unfair and anticompetitive
8421333 with the mac apple has for decades chosen to not travel the open code road and kept their technology proprietary this strategy has kept their market share small making an antitrust charge problematic in view of alternatives being readily available
8421334 we wanted to play in the champions league we have been in the semi final and final the last two years it was a tough match but we believed in ourselves and it was a good performance
8421335 they were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8421336 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8421337 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8421338 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8421339 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8421340 we want to make sure that the very basic rights that workers need rights like being able to join a union bargain collectively and participate in debates about their workplaces and industries are front and centre of the new legislation
8421341 many are low paid and many come from non english speaking backgrounds
8421342 even better than free most people would pay to take veggies away
8421343 the first half of 2008 has been particularly challenging with replacement demand in our key markets running at historic lows said chief executive paul oneile who will leave at the end of the year
8421344 unit volumes were the key driver with a total of 32 280 units sold up from 11 063 in the prior corresponding half aristocrat said in reference to japan
8421345 voglio che sappiate che tutto questo stata una gioia certo non ce labbiamo fatta ma caspita ci siamo divertiti
8421346 corsi intensivi per i prof del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola
8421347 mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit
8421348 corsi intensivi per i prof del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola
8421349 i was a very bossy child and i loved how j r was this ultimate villain with a smile
8421350 and the show itself just seemed like an incredible fantasy to me because i didnt grow up around money
8421351 people are always interested in what is not like them
8421352 they know their friends and family they dont know the super rich some of this is curiosity some of it is envy some of it is jealousy some of it is snarkiness
8421353 its interesting because when you look at when shows like this were very popular dynasty and dallas back in the day they debuted when there were economic hard times
8421354 and so a lot of times when the country goes through times like these where were in what is perceived by many as a recession having entertainment be escapist entertainment is what our viewers look for
8421355 on one hand it is acceptable in popular culture to show a fantasy lifestyle contrary to what most people are experiencing think about the kind of escapist films produced during the great depression for instance on the other hand there is a fine balance that must be struck so that the public is not pushed into scoffing at or rejecting portrayals of wealth
8421356 you want to make sure that youre not alienating a lot of viewers across the country who might be in tough financial situations
8421357 tonally we want it to be more like clueless and the devil wears prada
8421358 its a wish fulfillment comedy we want to keep it fun and upbeat
8421359 every woman who has visited our set just says omigod and squeals in delight
8421360 there is a sense of satisfaction in seeing those who have everything also have dysfunction and problems in their lives that money doesnt guarantee happiness and that the viewers own life is good even if she or he doesnt have as much money
8421361 this should be a one of a kind performance from shinedown we were able to scrape together a 10 piece string orchestra featuring members of the utah symphony to play some songs with them theyve never done this live before and ive never really seen anything like it except on award shows if we can pull it off it should be pretty special
8421362 may be one of the largest drug busts in state history
8421363 it was a question about timing in the house i knew that yesterday was the day some weeks ago
8421364 there was an intention to do it earlier but it conflicted as i understand it with some other events happening around parliament at the time
8421365 as i understand the conventions that exist it was quite proper for me to seek input
8421366 i was not asking for the ministers approval i wasnt asking for a serious piece of advice i was asking for input and her perspective which is quite different from what some have cast the relationship to be
8421367 im concerned that we attempt to put almost all new zealand police officers into a trained situation so that at the drop of a hat they may have to exercise the fine judgments that an officer has to in relation to a threat coming from someone and potentially use lethal force firearms guns
8421368 the greens are very opposed to these painful and sometimes lethal stun guns being introduced into the police armoury
8421369 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come
8421370 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher reoffending rates is far too high
8421371 if ministers want prisons to be focused on rehabilitation rather than warehousing offenders until they are released then it is not too late to make these plans disappear as fast as they appeared
8421372 we believe titan prison complexes are an essential part of a modernised prison estate that they will be the most effective way of providing value for money for taxpayers and of keeping them safe by reducing reoffending
8421373 prison is vital but it is also expensive we are absolutely determined to deliver a modernised prison estate which protects the public rehabilitates offenders and represents the best use of taxpayers money
8421374 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8421375 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8421376 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8421377 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8421378 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8421379 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8421380 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8421381 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8421382 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8421383 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8421384 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8421385 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8421386 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8421387 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8421388 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8421389 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8421390 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8421391 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8421392 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n

8421394 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8421395 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8421396 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8421397 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8421398 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

8421400 the shadow banking system model as practiced in recent years has been discredited
8421401 the bright new financial system for all its talented participants for all its rich rewards has failed the test of the market place
8421402 it all adds up to a clarion call for an effective response
8421403 the structure of the financial system changed fundamentally during the boom with dramatic growth in the share of assets outside the traditional banking system
8421404 the fundamental inadequacy of their own capital caused these problems
8421405 it makes sense to extend some form of greater prudential regulation to investment banks
8421406 if youre going to build it we should build it to the type of vehicle that may need to use it such as a fire truck a fuel oil truck or an ambulance

8421408 the very youngest students at st joes are the ones who are closest to the foot of that bridge
8421409 i think we should question the given that seems to be presumed here which is that the bridge is going to be reopened
8421410 ive got residents sending me letters saying when is my street going to be paved now that theres another 300 cars going over it
8421411 the dot and the feds have said that these bridges have to be built to withstand a certain weight of traffic and i think the bridge has to be replaced that way
8421412 its beyond some type of emergency repair without really undoing the entire bridge

8421423 the crusades brought about results of which the popes had never dreamed and which were perhaps the most important of all
8421424 some historians speculate that paper was a key element in cultural advancement
8421425 there are daily needs from principals to have access to small amounts of money to help students to help families in any emergency situation that may come up and we certainly dont want to impede that and prevent them from having access but there needs to be a little bit better control about the amount of money available and how it gets used
8421426 large school accounts probably can be i can see where they can use the regular general fund process and using purchase orders and claim form processes to avoid this

8421435 these numbers remind us that while the rising tide of energy prices has been lifting the oklahoma economy many families have not managed to make it onto the boat of prosperity
8421436 unfortunately it is these low income families that are facing the hardest times managing recent steep rises in the price of food gas and utilities
8421437 we need to remember that poverty can do terrible things to kids
8421438 it can leave them hungry poorly clothed and susceptible to a host of other stressors such as poor health and safety all the other risk factors that make children vulnerable are exacerbated by poverty

8421463 the atrocities against kashmiris were not stopped immediately the situation within india will deteriorate for which the government of india would be solely responsible
8421464 these sacrifices would bear fruit and the day is not so far when the sun of freedom would rise over kashmir
8421465 the kashmir issue is not merely a nuisance raised by a few militants but a heartfelt freedom movement of millions of kashmiris
8421466 the hindus had cut off their food and essential supplies by blocking the supply routes to occupied kashmir
8421467 lamented the conduct of secular pakistanis who he said would probably dance and sing with the indians at the wagah border tonight while indian muslims are mercilessly being slaughtered in occupied kashmir
8421468 no constraints whatsoever and would go to the last limits in helping our muslim brothers
8421469 smaller government a strong and ready national defense lower taxes and a government that encourages entrepreneurship and new job creation

8421590 where i disagree is the notion that the subprime charges are declining
8421591 the reason theyre not taking subprime charges this quarter is because credit spreads declined as in these monolines are a little bit better
8421592 these monolines are in process of coming to agreements with them on ending the coverage when cibc comes to that agreement they will be taking charges

8421596 dont foresee getting swept with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it and move on

8421598 you could sense we got a little bit too tight

8421601 as far as pitching and changing speeds thats as good as i have seen him
8421602 im not going to say it was a bad pitch

8421653 the second quarter was very active as we prepared the launch of the integrity tm signal processing series we are on track to launch both the integrity tm 600 series a new signal processing platform with multiple signal processing cards and the new c s series a system specific series of signal processing products customer demonstrations are currently being conducted and these products will figure prominently in september at the upcoming international broadcasters conference show in amsterdam these products are expected to significantly add to revenue over the next several quarters business activity slowed considerably in the us during the second quarter with many projects being delayed due to both economic and liquidity concerns we are now in the midst of our third quarter typically punctuated by strong us government purchasing we typically experience much stronger revenue in the second half of the year that trend is not expected to change for 2008 with the expected surge due to government spending cycles plus incremental revenue as the integrity tm line gains momentum we are looking for a strong second half to the year our earnings suffered in the quarter from the combination of weaker than expected quarterly revenue seasonal costs associated with the national association of broadcasters conference plus a non recurring spike in r amp d spending on technical consultants and other costs associated with the launch of the integrity tm series these engineering investments in product development are expected to payback handsomely over the very near term

8421697 please dont play this for anyone i dont normally do this
8421698 here is something now take that away and here is something else ok now well start
8421699 there were over 100 bikes that went by and stopped but not a one of them had any kind of training had any kind of equipment with them
8421700 the first thing we train everyone on is securing the scene make sure not only the victim but the responder is visible the last thing you want to do is run out in the street and get hit by another vehicle
8421701 drivers in milwaukee need to use a lot of extra caution and patience when theyre driving around motorcyclists
8421702 with the increase we see in fatalities we need to take care of our own take care of other people on the road as well
8421703 you got goose bumps on your arms it was nice just a nice homecoming
8421704 have a lot of fun see a lot of bikes look at pretty women
8421705 f amp m have also kept up their interest in some of lifes finer things motorik pulses retro futurist electronics fake japanese accents
8421706 the cool professionalism with which fujiya amp miyagi lay out their grooves is a thing of beauty
8421707 this is dance music downsized for ipods but also indie rock expanded for the dance floor
8421708 theyre doing for 70s krautrock and motorik what the dfa did for early 80s electro indeed without even being asked theyve gone and done the unthinkable theyve actually made krautrock fun
8421709 i just would hate if someone had gotten hurt this is so criminal and terrible
8421710 you just worry that one of those needles could be infected with something
8421711 we cant say for sure that avalon beaches have been targeted but it is the mayors belief that this was a purposeful act
8421712 medical waste does not wind up on a boat near a local shoreline any place in as labor day weekend approaches there is concern that more waste could force officials to shut the beaches again
8421713 its really just a downfall because its been such a great summer and you hate to see it end on such a bitter note
8421714 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
8421715 it is vulgar it is ugly it is stupid it is tedious it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus and yet it is somehow charming one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour
8421716 in light of greater demands on our available cash increased competition and challenging economic and capital market conditions
8421717 were going to continue to watch the economy very closely
8421718 i still believe that this 333 million project which will create over 1 000 jobs will be a benefit to the city of buffalo
8421719 were so proud to be here the sun comes up in maine first in the nation we feel very honored
8421720 its beginning to be recognized it has to be part of our partys dialogue
8421721 theres something about being out west where we can expand our horizons
8421722 9 11 has become such a powerful narrative that many of us cant remember that before 9 11 we werent living in fear
8421723 today the lgbt movement has lost a true community treasure and role model
8421724 i am reminded of the amazing chutzpah of del and phyllis from an early age they recognized their right to love freely to organize their community and to advocate for their rights i have always appreciated del and phyllis long time moral emotional and material support of colage and their recognition of the importance of youth and adults with lgbt parents in our movement our thoughts are with phyllis and kendra during this time of grieving and with the entire community as we reflect on dels amazing contributions to social justice and lgbt rights
8421725 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8421726 i also never imagined there would be day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8421727 no se puede leer una cosa as sin llevar los labios pintados
8421728 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8421729 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8421730 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8421731 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8421732 the champions league is a dream and now we can fight for this dream id like to play in all the matches and lift the cup
8421733 when youre at juve its natural to have enthusiasm and im very happy with the goal it boosts morale
8421734 were physically and psychologically fit and we have the right attitude too we strikers are all willing to help out and we give all we can whether we play from the start or we come on during a match
8421735 i think that ancelotti will be happy with the squad we have assembled for him and now its his problem to win the league
8421736 he knows we have a title winning side now and although that means we can also lose it we have to be fighting to the end
8421737 i didnt see a great difference between inter and roma over the match the roma players can come away with their head held high
8421738 they got over certain situations which last season proved difficult to overturn
8421739 we need to aim for what is possible to achieve but we can be rest assured because the players we have are very good and know how to cope in different situations
8421740 what i need is the collective especially when it comes down to group mentality its not one player who makes the difference
8421741 in fact roma have won even when the likes of totti taddei and mancini were missing
8421742 a jury was able to see that and come to the correct verdict
8421743 we thought there was certainly enough evidence to convict this person of this crime the jury chose to ignore it
8421744 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive
8421745 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8421746 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8421747 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton hold amicably ended their calling
8421748 they appreciate your honor with a view to their privacy in this matter
8421749 commit to a project to build a chip fabrication plant
8421750 it was such big news for the region it got built up a little bit and people made a natural assumption that this means that were building a new fab
8421751 when in reality all that was really announced in 2006 was that we had this option to build a fab
8421752 this is about their books and their finances more than their operations
8421753 its about getting rid of the capital requirements for manufacturing
8421754 when the new york deal was done in 2006 amd was well on its way to ascendancy in terms of market share
8421755 the belief was that two current generation fabs would be necessary to satisfy full demand if they got to the 30 percent goal share of the x86 architecture chip market but theyre not at the goal theyre roughly in the 20 percent range
8421756 there may be some issues with amd having to retain controlling ownership in order to be ok with patent licensing agreement with intel
8421757 probably end up with some entity thats halfway between amd and some other concern with a very interestingly structured contract built around it
8421758 the whole reason for asset smart was that the fabs that they owned were a drag on their finances add another plant on top of that that would not be the most prudent thing
8421759 the option to build the fab in upstate new york is going to be a piece of the asset smart strategy
8421760 we need to announce the asset smart strategy first and get all those pieces locked into place first and then well be in a position to announce what well do with the malta fab 4x
8421761 la corrupci n y la crisis inmobiliaria les ha dejado sin sus ahorros y en muchos casos sin su casa

8421773 there is a strong probability that it will be a category 3 storm by the time it enters the gulf and it has the potential to strengthen into a category 4 or 5 storm over the gulf
8421774 does love bring about the keeping of the commandments or does the keeping of the commandments bring about love but who can doubt that love comes first for the one who does not love has no reason for keeping the commandments
8421775 do not worry about tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself sufficient for a day is its own evil
8421776 we have not decided on the amount or on the exact timing mr dunn said
8421777 it was just a real shady horrible place with raccoons outside a dark alley and cats everywhere
8421778 he had a choice to get into a big penthouse

8421782 i know i made the right move no matter what the outcome is whether i knock labarda out or destroy him over 12 rounds i know i made the right choice
8421783 i dont want to hear about caballero because if we lose this one theres no caballero
8421784 we come with the great illusion that we can actually win the championship
8421785 although inspired by the contents is not a representation of mr mcgartlands life
8421786 he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8421787 i should not have been placed in that position i was never in such a position
8421788 i cannot understand why they had to change things to that extent

8421793 ag ero es un jugador que siempre aporta al distinto est en estado de gracia y es muy maduro para su edad creo que su entrada y la de maniche en el once inicial fue una inyecci n necesaria para conseguirlo
8421794 el atl tico ha logrado una victoria merecida hay que felicitarlo en la segunda parte estuvimos mejor y con opciones pero tras el 2 0 nos venimos abajo y ah estuvo la clave del partido estoy decepcionado pero no puedo echar la culpa a mis jugadores el atl tico tiene delanteros muy buenos y juega bien
8421795 in a conversation with sen daniel patrick moynihan after a sharp confrontation in the senate foreign relations committee on the subject of the settlements begin defined himself as a proud jew who does not tremble with fear when speaking with foreign statesmen
8421796 his words were there would be no money for any person who opposed the sale
8421797 i am not going to be blackmailed if he has said that then he should withdraw it the threat is going to fall on deaf ears
8421798 i dont think this slashing funding is going to happen frankly
8421799 ill be going to the caucus meeting tomorrow thursday and i will be asking the premier to ask mr costa to withdraw his comments
8421800 i rang the treasurer and he flatly denies it absolutely not true

8421807 any parent or students who would like to discuss child protection matters are welcome to contact myself or our college counsellor rosemary clifton to discuss any issue of concern
8421808 this is a very sensitive and complex issue and i wont discuss actual numbers
8421809 i will say the police investigation does not relate to current staff at the college there are no allegations of recent offences these matters are historic in nature
8421810 i understand it may be difficult to come forward but i can assure everyone their information will be taken very seriously and in the strictest confidence
8421811 i didnt have a clue these types of things were going on
8421812 i never heard any mention of it when i read the newspapers this morning i was shocked just dumbfounded

8421827 my grandmother always used to tell us that my father was good for nothing
8421828 our dad was cracking her toes and cracking his hand on her head thats what he always did
8421829 my grandmother asked her how it hurt and where does he touch you after he cracks your feet and things like that
8421830 shes a very mean person she would do things to hurt people not just any people i mean like family members

8421865 se lape scomparisse alluomo non resterebbero che quattro anni di vita
8421866 il pubblico ministero deve chiarire quali sono stati i tentativi della bayer di opporsi a un bando dellimidaclopride e della clothianidina in seguito alla sospensione di entrambe le sostanze in francia abbiamo il sospetto che la bayer abbia presentato studi difettosi per sminuire il rischio di residui del pesticida nelle piante
8421867 tutti gli studi sul campo sono stati trovati carenti sia nellimpostazione che nella conduzione e sono quindi stati considerati solo come informazione aggiuntiva la clothianidina pu mettere a rischio le api mellifere e altri impollinatori se lesposizione avviene attraverso il polline e il nettare delle coltivazioni avviate con semi trattati
8421868 va anche notato che la clothianidina ha una lunga persistenza nel suolo con una elevata trasmissione di residui alla successiva stagione di coltivazione la clothianidina anche mobile attraverso il suolo
8421869 il battito dali di una farfalla pu provocare un uragano dallaltra parte del mondo
8421870 il consiglio direttivo della bayer deve essere chiamato a rispondere dal momento che i rischi dei neocotinoidi come limidaclopride e la clothianidina sono noti da pi di dieci anni con vendite annuali per quasi 800 milioni di euro limidaclopride e la clothianidina sono tra i prodotti pi importanti della bayer questa la ragione per cui la bayer si oppone ad ogni proibizione del loro uso malgrado i seri danni ambientali
8421871 those who made the judgment regarded themselves as educated people
8421872 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict
8421873 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8421874 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8421875 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8421876 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8421877 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8421878 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8421879 a further check of the driver and vehicle disclosed 1 2 ounces of crack cocaine and 1 400 in cash
8421880 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8421881 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8421882 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8421883 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8421884 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8421885 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy
8421886 im looking at buying a few and putting them in our cars i think it would be advantageous for our members as investigators
8421887 it will make not only the person being stopped but also our members more accountable for their actions
8421888 we actually have many very innovative ideas in kelowna and are leading edge in many ways that is somewhat pleasing because people are continually picking my brain about what were doing because word has spread that weve had some success especially in the downtown core
8421889 the fact is that a very small percentage of people are responsible for over 50 of the crime probably five per cent of the people account for committing 50 of the crime we have to find some legislation to deal with keeping prolific offenders behind bars
8421890 were all struggling trying to find members to become police officers its getting to a critical stage that people dont want to join police organizations anymore
8421891 the election office is now up an running out of the city clerks division and were here to answer any questions potential candidates or electors may have
8421892 during the next two years the province will continue to work with local elected officials and first nations to ensure any new information about the potential impact sales may have on water quality and the ability to expand the reservoirs is reviewed
8421893 i would have preferred they said it was over and done with but theyve agreed to back off now we all have a chance to say no
8421894 the way it is today the impact on reservoir lakes is low theres no year round residency and we have to protect those watersheds so there was concern that the government would be reselling the lots and development would take place
8421895 its very good news weve always said that its not just a matter of water quality but also quantity we do need the storage studies and im certainly pleased to see that they are not making any moves until we get more information to them
8421896 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
8421897 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
8421898 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
8421899 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
8421900 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to ontario to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
8421901 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8421902 gerrard has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days
8421903 its not serious but we need to do it he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 percent fit
8421904 he had a problem for the first leg with liege and when he went away with england for the friendly last week against the czech republic we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8421905 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8421906 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama
8421907 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8421908 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8421909 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8421910 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8421911 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8421912 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8421913 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8421914 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
8421915 this is xyz workbook from zyx publisher the book is like new there is no writing in this book
8421916 my husband and i agreed not to spend over twenty dollars at one time without consulting each other the books i purchased from you cost almost twenty dollars each so this way i dont have to ask him first
8421917 oh dont worry about it ebay is the only place i can buy sports equipment without paying attention to what i am spending if it comes from ebay my wife thinks it has to be a bargain so she doesnt complain
8421918 its not unusual for an opposition to be ahead of a government in polls taken between elections sometimes voters are pretty savvy and use these early polls as a way of beating up on the government and making them listen a bit more
8421919 so this is a pretty important change which i would say does represent something
8421920 the ndp message may be resonating but its not going to be enough to propel her into government unless she can change the minds of those who havent decided
8421921 heck its something understood by accountants so it cant be that difficult
8421922 there clearly is the risk that equity outflows will continue
8421923 we think that philippine government bonds despite the sell off since january are still overpriced
8421924 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8421925 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8421926 it was our belief that all victims of bigoted behavior can benefit by looking inside themselves for relief from the harm they suffer
8421927 when others told me i was unworthy i knew they were wrong and i knew they were lying i no longer fight the lie i have better things to do with my time and energy
8421928 what was believed to be a ferocious bear with the power to devour all in its path was revealed to be nothing not even a speck blowing harmlessly in the wind

8421930 were not opposed to private sector involvement in the delivery of electricity per se
8421931 whats your business need what kinds of high availability do you need
8421932 this is a weird story at the democratic convention trojan condoms has set up a pavilion where theyre handing out thousands of free condoms yeah apparently theyre doing this in case john edwards shows up
8421933 the republican convention is next week john mccains campaign told president bush that despite his low popularity he will be allowed to speak at the first night of the convention he also told bush that the convention starts in december
8421934 well the great thing about the olympics of course is you have people who are otherwise enemies putting aside their differences and pretending to get along for a couple of days im sorry thats the democratic convention
8421935 a reported 5 million on television advertising while mccain spent nothing
8421936 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
8421937 some of them you know i know everybodys got problems and stuff like that but theres other ways theres better ways of dealing with it
8421938 other states have targeted the thieves moreso than the business owners
8421939 the state of tennessee wanted to target the business owners to stop the thieves
8421940 we will not be telling owners when theyll be coming in and doing inspections and theyll have to have records of everything
8421941 you have to use a lot of common sense in our business
8421942 the things that are potentially obvious stolen property the manhole covers the sewer grates the cemetery vases
8421943 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
8421944 i sholom keller do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the united states of america against all enemies foreign and domestic and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same
8421945 i wanted to dedicate my life to a cause greater than myself
8421946 i had a real sense of pride in being an american i wanted to give back to my country
8421947 i didnt take an oath to wage war against whomever the president decides to fight
8421948 i took an oath to defend the constitution and with it the nation and the people and the oath didnt expire when i got out of the army
8421949 what i feel is a big problem with america today is that we dont have a citizenry thats as engaged as it should be
8421950 but then i come out here and i say hey we have something
8421951 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8421952 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8421953 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8421954 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8421955 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8421956 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8421957 enable on demand user generated mashups with existing open web apis
8421958 we obviously didnt expect this series with the pitchers we had going
8421959 dont foresee getting swept with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it and move on
8421960 we want to make the other team sweat a little bit the last thing we want to do is have people come in here and us be pushovers
8421961 the first day we were here haren pitched really well and today for them to win both of those games and sweep us the off day might be coming at the right time for us
8421962 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8421963 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have weve had a lot of games where we have been heartbroken this year
8421964 weve had issues earlier with closing out games its been a problem for us all year but weve always responded
8421965 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8421966 as far as pitching and changing speeds thats as good as i have seen him
8421967 im not going to say it was a bad pitch
8421968 it was down obviously he hit it but the single he had in the third was the same pitch down

8421977 you avoid the necessity of a crew having to go out in a bucket truck getting up onto their ladder and pulling out a light bulb every three or four years which typically costs anywhere from 800 to 1 000 each time

8421981 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park
8421982 he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8421983 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8421984 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8421985 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8421986 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8421987 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8421988 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8421997 tough action is necessary and the tough action our reform demands will be rewarded
8421998 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes but were not making investments without demanding accountability in return

8422002 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8422003 the coalition welcomes the fact that mr rudd is now following our agenda for higher standards and quality in schools but talk is no substitute for action
8422004 mr rudds pressing priority is to lift economic confidence and certainty for australians and australian businesses that are worse off under his government

8422034 weve seen the positive impact that 40 days for life has on the community and it has inspired more to join our efforts
8422035 weve seen hearts and minds change weve seen women turn away from abortion weve redirected women in need to resources that will provide love and support to them and their babies would be clients of planned parenthood have thanked us for our prayers and for our help this is all a result of the power of prayer fasting and gods faithfulness to his promises

8422044 frankly we think that he has the potential to be one of the more dominant defensive linemen in the country
8422045 we really have to get him on the field and get him healthy before that starts showing i think his playing in this game is important to him so that he can get on board and get as comfortable playing week after week as any of the guys on the team

8422126 the real story is why st louis does not have a viable preservationist lobby pushing for the rehab of buildings like the one at page and kingshighway

8422135 most company directors are blissfully unaware of the administrative or privileged passwords that their it staff has access to which allows them to see everything that is going on within the company these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as its often considered too much hassle when people leave the organization they can often still access the network using these passwords to acquire highly sensitive data
8422136 our advice is to secure these privileged passwords and identities and routinely change and manage them so that if an employees contract is terminated whether voluntary or not they cant maliciously wreak havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain
8422137 you can install the best security systems in the world but if your staff does not respect the information they are entrusted with then the information will most definitely go astray just as the findings of this survey have illustrated
8422138 thats why we recommend companies secure their privileged identities and sensitive information in a digital vault only giving individuals access to the information they actually need when they need it while also keeping a log of who has accessed what and when
8422139 avoid the 28 campaign where units will be driving the streets looking solely for drunken drivers

8422203 it wasnt a good performance but we always know we have the quality to score
8422204 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8422205 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8422206 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8422207 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8422208 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8422209 we are thrilled with the courts ruling and agree with judge blakes assessment that this will promote greater competition and more choice for consumers
8422210 in addition to vindicating our long held position this ruling will enable chamilia to serve even more retailers and allow consumers a greater ability to design and personalize their jewelry
8422211 the interchangeability of chamilia and pandora beads only promotes competition and choice for consumers
8422212 the kd mscat8x8 allows the customer to view any source on any display at any given time key digital presents you with a full video audio matrix switching solution and the capability to control it via rs 232 or ir with your choice of any full system automation control company its the perfect solution for commercial and residential installations putting the installer in the drivers seat of their boardroom or multi zone installation
8422213 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8422214 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8422215 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8422216 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8422217 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back

8422224 for the year weve saved people 35 percent off of the total costs of their prescriptions
8422225 so everyone who used the card saved an average of 19 53 per prescription
8422226 total costs were 65 374 54 which means residents saved a total of 37 percent on their prescriptions for the month of july
8422227 the total prescription costs for members totaled 298 058 82 of that we were able to save 159 491 89 which saved each member 16 89 off of each prescription
8422228 the cards certainly got to the people who need it most those who dont have a drug plan or their prescription isnt covered under their plan
8422229 virtually every drug store in the county should carry it if you dont see it ask the pharmacist because we just distributed a new batch of cards
8422230 the internet more so than anything else has done serious damage to the advertising base newspapers rely on particularly classifieds now that the genie has been let out of the bottle though its going to be a big challenge to papers around the country to figure out how to adapt to this new environment
8422231 those who move frequently tend to not care about their communities as much and therefore dont need to know what is happening in their communities
8422232 magazines had to move from being a mass market industry to being a niche medium once they went for quality of eyeballs rather than quantity they found their footing and got their bearings
8422233 television has taken over we have to realize that newspapers are the one indispensable medium for those who want to know or need to know about community and government structure
8422234 our current administrations views on the freedom of information were forged by 9 11 and as a result there has been an explosion of documents that have been classified and very little declassified over the past eight years
8422235 weve heard the same questions over and over again but what do we really know about where the candidates stand i fault an unimaginative press

8422265 we have fire stations on 14th and police god forbid if anything happens and theres a train there they cant get through

8422273 well the fact that you assume obama is telling everyone to fill their tires with helium which by the way would actually help with impact control in a accident its absolutly barbarak that you would choose obama as the one behind this why
8422274 ha cuz you dont know them youre just racist end of story and because hes a democrat you automatically assume hes crazy you can thank you parents for your wonderful mind set last time i checked its better if you find out this stuff on your own you claim to be so smart yet you listen and accept all concepts your friends teachers and authority figures tell you because you dont want to find out you just dont care thats why youre completly ridiculous i feel bad for you it must really suck to not be able to think for yourself

8422309 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8422310 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8422311 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8422312 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary

8422322 um no we dont watch car burglaries they happen a lot in this parking lot but we have no way stopping them we dont have video
8422323 let me rephrase that if there was a bag of popcorn sitting right here in between you and me would you be eating it
8422324 then i will go all the way back down to get popcorn
8422325 wait if the concession stand right outside is not open do not go all the way back down just come back
8422326 ok and oh if youre going to go anyway then make sure its extra extra butter
8422327 10 things that you think are cool but really make you look stupid
8422328 pv used to be one of my go to restaurants then i went here no lengua on the menu
8422329 im a big fan of aminas cooking and would happy follow her around sf
8422330 im a novice at french cuisine and if you are too then star box is a fantastic introduction
8422331 as other yelpers have said over and over madeleine works magic
8422332 two inches off the bottom trim the layers and i want shorter bangs
8422333 there were a lot of people who supported senator obama early and i was not one of them he understandably feels an amount of loyalty and obligation i am sure to make sure that they are given an opportunity especially if they risked a lot politically by coming out early for him
8422334 how could we not go to san francisco and not ride on the cable cars
8422335 no go order your drink with your shirt off and you will be god of this bar
8422336 if you dont like what he said you can leave
8422337 obviously matt hasnt been to los angeles or new york lately
8422338 is it cool that i start my review awwww sheeeeeed
8422339 alas scandal subject like everything else to inflation has become a highly overpriced commodity
8422340 t he real incomes of middle class families have grown twice as fast under democrats as they have under republicans while the real incomes of working poor families have grown six times as fast under democrats as they have under republicans
8422341 t he number of filings this quarter the three month period that ended in june is the highest the federal judiciary has seen since the first quarter of 2006 that spike was largely attributed to the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 and filings leveled by march 2006
8422342 the government is too weak to prevent private groups from pursuing coercive reversals of saddam husseins various ethnic cleansings and in the absence of law and order iraqis seek safety in sectarian clustering
8422343 if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that
8422344 thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
8422345 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
8422346 we have no more to do with our second birth than we had to do with our first birth
8422347 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever
8422348 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water
8422349 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit
8422350 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which we are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
8422351 hear the word of god or the gospel message or both and because of the spirit working in the word as well as in the heart of man the man opens his heart and receives that message as the word of life to his soul
8422352 i just shot at something that i thought was a deer but it was another hunter im afraid i just killed him

8422357 the last couple of races you seem to have fallen off a little bit what do you think has changed
8422358 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8422359 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8422360 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8422361 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8422362 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8422363 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8422364 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8422365 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue

8422369 were going to wait to see what im going to do i might have to give him an extra day
8422370 i cant say when hes going to pitch or if in fact hes not going to pitch until he plays catch
8422371 dont foresee getting swept with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it and move on
8422372 we want to make the other team sweat a little bit the last thing we want to do is have people come in here and us be pushovers
8422373 the first day we were here haren pitched really well and today for them to win both of those games and sweep us the off day might be coming at the right time for us
8422374 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8422375 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have
8422376 weve had issues earlier with closing out games its been a problem for us all year but weve always responded
8422377 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8422378 as far as pitching and changing speeds thats as good as i have seen him
8422379 im not going to say it was a bad pitch
8422380 it was down obviously he hit it but the single he had in the third was the same pitch down

8422387 they all got off the bus and were ready to be here
8422388 theyll get to know each other very quickly and they are enjoying their first day
8422389 over the past several years continuing numerous and substantial leaks and water infiltration has occurred at the new elementary schools
8422390 these leaks and water infiltration caused damage inside the new elementary schools and presented potential health hazards to the children teachers and other occupants of the new elementary schools
8422391 you could certainly draw the inference that we were not able to get cooperation
8422392 we want the vendors that did it to do the repairs
8422393 it definitely was not a district issue and we need to get those buildings fixed
8422394 the main thing is cliff and my wife were best friends

8422417 the boys gave their best and i think its back to the drawing board for us the development of players in the island is good because its shown in our performance but we need to look into the preparation so that we come back next year another step higher

8422469 you kind of hate to see it just because youre starting to change the game
8422470 really i think its probably going to be more fair and its probably going to be the right way to do it but its starting to change the game change the way its always been called
8422471 i think changing the game and putting instant replay in in my mind is wrong
8422472 next thing you know its going to be computerized strike zones with no umpires thats the next step i just dont agree with bringing the instant replay in it makes the umpires look bad if theyre wrong
8422473 the pitchers are going to suffer because of the fact that he has to stand on the mound and not do anything
8422474 hopefully they just find a way to do it quickly
8422475 you dont want to be standing out there every time somebody hits a home run waiting for them to figure it out lets see how it works maybe its something that goes quickly and its not even an issue but yeah thatd be a concern especially with them trying to speed games up i think that would put a hamper on that
8422476 i dont want the human element taken out of this game
8422477 i dont want there to be computers or machines doing the job of our umpires
8422478 to me mini books are freedom they are confidence builders they are fun they are a break from the process of scrapbooking in your regular format

8422480 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8422481 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8422482 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8422483 all this was a big joke it got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be
8422484 i dont believe it does affect my credibility at all because this is bigfoot
8422485 it would be one thing if i came out and said that i had something else that is tangible or real but right now as far as im concerned there is no real bigfoot

8422494 people put me aside and dont understand my importance they even forget to love those who are nearest to them
8422495 why are you not burning you are supposed to stay lit until the end
8422496 dont be afraid for i am hope and while i still burn we can re light the other candles
8422497 spread love everywhere you go first of all in your own house let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile kindness
8422498 do not let trifles disturb the tranquility of your mind life is too precious to be sacrificed for the nonessential and transient ignore the inconsequential
8422499 i dont believe it was an intentional avenue but i just know that the funds have been decreasing tremendously and its something we should look into because those fees over the years should have increased not decreased

8422505 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8422506 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8422507 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8422508 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8422509 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator

8422514 the intention is to ensure that we develop a highly efficient and well managed archival system that follows modern and internationally recognised practices
8422515 all archives when properly managed could tell us the entire history of our nation and the developments that it has gone through from the early years to the present day
8422516 the website will have information about the operations and activities
8422517 it is going to be very elegant and firmly rooted in the traditional operatic style but rather than using costumes from the period we have costumes that echo the silhouette of the period with more of a haute couture look there will be lots of reflective surfaces and i cant tell you how many chandeliers

8422524 we want to make sure that the very basic rights that workers need rights like being able to join a union bargain collectively and participate in debates about their workplaces and industries are front and centre of the new legislation
8422525 many are low paid and many come from non english speaking backgrounds

8422528 with your help we can prevent the fatal results that will no doubt occur if we remain silent and current plans go forward no professional driver ever willingly puts their self or others at risk but that is exactly what we are being asked to do if bicycles are allowed traverse where multiple 20 ton busses and 3 max lines are maneuvering we cannot let the city of council of portland squeeze a bike lane through the rose quarter transit center
8422529 even the union with its mission to protect drivers seems to be sitting on its hands on an issue that can potentially not only end careers but will cost lives
8422530 what is so compelling about putting a bike lane through the rose quarter transit center
8422531 were not thrust onto these folks its something that has been developed with a lot of integrity
8422532 with your help we can prevent the fatal results that will no doubt occur if we remain silent and current plans go forward
8422533 this bus drives itself i was just sitting here watching the fatal results occur
8422534 why is it such a big deal to go around the transit center
8422535 we have no political agenda but since we sometimes kill you you must be banned from all bus routes for your own safety
8422536 because their rationale here is that they cannot safely drive around bicyclists
8422537 what is so compelling bikes have gone around for years

8422546 its about a journey of a boy who goes to find his donkey back and through his journey he meets interesting characters its a very big tussle for the boy to go and get his donkey back so during this event there are so many things that happen i thought of making it the newspaper report into a film but in a way that its like a fable with morals and things like that but it has a lot of surprises
8422547 moreover there are some interesting characters like the dumb shepherd played by rahul bose half widow played by sarika and anupam kher who guides the boy the film gives you the message of friendship

8422570 we are delighted that so many communities want to run first aid courses for their members the preservation of human life is of utmost importance in judaism
8422571 it is so important to learn first aid as it becomes a life skill and you never know when it will be required
8422572 when he came to the synagogue he was bleeding and very upset
8422573 i have never seen it so bad it is frightening
8422574 these latest acts of anti semitism in the laurentians reinforce the need for action to counter this disturbing trend
8422575 instead of spending all that money on elaborate publicity just give the money to the people who come to the program theyll be happier
8422576 this was an idea to get students involved in learning judaism learning about their heritage and as an incentive in order to give them the amazing knowledge and to give them right mind set its to lock them in
8422577 have to commit to 10 classes and come to weekend getaways
8422578 but to be quite honest i heard there was a 500 check that went along with it so it sounded intriguing the check
8422579 someone that comes only for the financial benefit is not really the quality student were looking for
8422580 why does a pizza place offer a buy one get one free its to get them in the door and then if they like it theyre going to stay
8422581 god forbid you give them cash thats very very bad
8422582 but if you give them this gigantic food thing like some of the organizations bring in a chinese food chef and have a whole chinese thing thats not seen as unseemly or a bribe i really dont understand totally the difference
8422583 ethics like most law makes no distinction between incentives in the form of cash or cash equivalent
8422584 some corporations for example forbid employees from accepting gifts from suppliers above a certain cash value some campaign law does likewise when it comes to food id be particularly wary of any diamond encrusted chicken legs
8422585 it trivializes judaism and it portrays secular jews as people to be bought off
8422586 its insincere it sends all the wrong signals that we dont think the material alone would be compelling that we need to buy you off

8422591 whatever is happening politically the bottom line is tomorrow morning the government is going to have to make a decision about building two power stations which are going to cost upwards of 10 billion
8422592 it doesnt have the money and it is going to come out of schools transport and other infrastructure budgets or alternatively the state will start to go into dangerous levels of debt
8422593 the business community is not only dismayed that it has happened it is confused by how it has happened because anybody who understands government finances and the energy issue thinks there was no alternative to privatisation
8422594 nsw now has a very dangerous situation where it cant invite the private sector to help fund this important infrastructure and it doesnt have the money in the forward estimates of the budget to do it itself
8422595 the defeat of the electricity sale is extremely disappointing and will have serious implications on the development of new transport infrastructure in nsw
8422596 it means that taxpayers money will stay tied up in obsolete coal fired power generators instead of being re invested in critical capacity building urban transport projects such as the m4 east and the proposed metro rail system
8422597 we would urge the liberal party to certainly reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8422598 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8422599 this was one way to provide the money to have reinvested in the states grid to provide certainty of supply

8422649 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8422650 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way
8422651 were fortunate to be involved in both the dnc and the rnc the democrats have gotten the majority of the buzz for employing emerging media in their campaigns so were proud to be opening up the social media dialogue to both parties

8422764 it may be the cannabinoid systems this is a crude example but i think of them as our internal shock absorbers
8422765 they are circuits that prevent overexcitability kind of dampers if thats correct there are going to be a number of medical applications for example i wouldnt be surprised if there were applications for epilepsy and other types of seizures
8422766 there are cannabinoid receptor systems in the brain areas that regulate motion and in retrospect we know that people with multiple sclerosis and difficulty with spasticity sometimes use medicinal cannabis that is one of the institute of medicine indications for clinical trials
8422767 there is a cannabinoid receptor for pain another site that modulates appetite theres going to be a wealth of basic science research that will hopefully have clinical and practical applications to many different medical indications
8422768 much of the published work on marijuana and the immune system is focused on animals and in vitro studies
8422769 and well if you flood a lot of petri dishes with thc the active ingredient in marijuana the immune cell cultures are going to do poorly
8422770 in our clinical trial we really didnt see any detriment to the immune system from smoking cannabis basically we saw no perturbation of hiv viral load no detriment to the immune system and no significant interaction with anti hiv drugs
8422771 i was pretty much the lone ranger of medical marijuana research a few years ago but not now
8422772 still researchers are wary of marijuana research they feel their reputation may be tainted and they may be right for several years ive been invited to do grand rounds at a local hospital in the bay area last year they disinvited me and i hear it was because of my marijuana research ive been disinvited from other speaking engagements too
8422773 i think these attitudes will change over time but it will be slow going
8422774 dr abrams comment is typical people in the medical profession may chuckle at marijuana research and think it is not a bona fide area for scientific investigation but that will change as the science becomes more clear and more understandable and there are at some point some practical applications
8422775 we get a number of stories from elected officials who say look i am not for legalization of marijuana
8422776 a number of people have friends where medical therapies arent working and cannabis provided relief from spasticity pain nausea or vomiting that is turning some opinions and helping people let go of the stereotypical notion that medical marijuana is for potheads
8422777 i think that even if our center runs on hard times the ball has started rolling
8422778 clinicians and neuroscientists have an interest in this there is gong to be more research and more clinical work whether we do it or not eventually i foresee nih national institutes of health clinical trials thats my hunch
8422779 the data that are out there suggest there will be some positive applications for marijuana if i had to bet id say there will be some applications useful for patients in the future
8422780 the caution is that in the movement toward making marijuana available to patients with no other treatment options there is the assumption that it is in fact useful we have to be careful about that
8422781 it may be useful for some things but not useful for others and if patients take things that are not useful they may be harming themselves i urge them to be cautious instead of jumping on the bandwagon and maybe hurting themselves
8422782 i was pretty much the lone ranger of medical marijuana research a few years ago but not now
8422783 still researchers are wary of marijuana research they feel their reputation may be tainted and they may be right for several years ive been invited to do grand rounds at a local hospital in the bay area last year they disinvited me and i hear it was because of my marijuana research ive been disinvited from other speaking engagements too

8422786 we get a number of stories from elected officials who say look i am not for legalization of marijuana
8422787 a number of people have friends where medical therapies arent working and cannabis provided relief from spasticity pain nausea or vomiting that is turning some opinions and helping people let go of the stereotypical notion that medical marijuana is for potheads
8422788 i think that even if our center runs on hard times the ball has started rolling
8422789 clinicians and neuroscientists have an interest in this there is gong to be more research and more clinical work whether we do it or not eventually i foresee nih national institutes of health clinical trials thats my hunch
8422790 the data that are out there suggest there will be some positive applications for marijuana if i had to bet id say there will be some applications useful for patients in the future
8422791 the caution is that in the movement toward making marijuana available to patients with no other treatment options there is the assumption that it is in fact useful we have to be careful about that
8422792 it may be useful for some things but not useful for others and if patients take things that are not useful they may be harming themselves i urge them to be cautious instead of jumping on the bandwagon and maybe hurting themselves
8422793 it may be the cannabinoid systems this is a crude example but i think of them as our internal shock absorbers
8422794 they are circuits that prevent overexcitability kind of dampers if thats correct there are going to be a number of medical applications for example i wouldnt be surprised if there were applications for epilepsy and other types of seizures
8422795 there are cannabinoid receptor systems in the brain areas that regulate motion and in retrospect we know that people with multiple sclerosis and difficulty with spasticity sometimes use medicinal cannabis that is one of the institute of medicine indications for clinical trials
8422796 there is a cannabinoid receptor for pain another site that modulates appetite theres going to be a wealth of basic science research that will hopefully have clinical and practical applications to many different medical indications
8422797 much of the published work on marijuana and the immune system is focused on animals and in vitro studies
8422798 and well if you flood a lot of petri dishes with thc the active ingredient in marijuana the immune cell cultures are going to do poorly

8422861 i believe what she said last night im voting for barack
8422862 a few questions about the game they just spent the last four years making i asked not to talk to the games lead creator the widely quoted
8422863 id say i am most proud of how the rpg and action blend turned out in the game i feel the combat is incredibly exciting and intense while the rpg side is quite deep and ultimately satisfying which is a tough combination to achieve in one game
8422864 as to what i am most proud of it would be what happened behind the scenes during the production of too human i celebrate the many departmental walls that were torn down and individual egos that got put aside to create a family of exceptionally talented people that even now continue to learn and help one another it may sound hokey but it really is something rare and is something to be proud of
8422865 one of the main reasons it was used in too human was because it was the best way to fight 360 degrees of enemies in mass amounts
8422866 instead of requiring a player to orientate a direction and then execute an attack you could now do that in one quick seamless and fluid motion action
8422867 the right stick combat is so core to the game play style we really felt nothing else could retain too humans feel and core in too human you are battling thousands and thousands of enemies in a style more akin to something like
8422868 instead of mainly focusing on just 1 on 1 combat we could allow players to attack a multitude of enemies in varying directions rapidly
8422869 as you can see with the combo system its more about using advanced stick combinations juggles finishers etc and chaining a series of enemies together than it is using a typical button combo string on a singular enemy this results in not only a unique experience but the ability to devastate massive quantities of enemies in the blink of an eye which is just plain exciting and fun
8422870 too human is just the latest action game to check out but gamers who follow the news know the game had a
8422871 i never understood the idea of presenting an unfinished product to build marketing and press momentum
8422872 as an artist with an m b a i never understood the idea of presenting an unfinished product to build marketing and press momentum especially when that product doesnt fit within the norms of a typical game reference
8422873 people say a lot of things so really whatever speculations were out there at the time did not affect my work in any way the public perception of what too human was i dont think scratched the surface of what was really going on here internally we were just focused on making the music sound good and making the overall audio experience be as good as it could be
8422874 i think too human has fewer enemy types than people expected fewer levels to play in but more loot to collect and more character levels to progress through how did the team determine that right amount of all that for lack of a better way of describing it stuff
8422875 the team focused on enemies that interacted well with each other in different combinations so that players could experience the widest depth of encounters and tactics
8422876 if you havent played through to level 50 you have most likely not seen all of the games enemy variations
8422877 as the player progresses through the game from not just area to area but all the way from levels 1 50 all these enemy variations get introduced to constantly make the player come up with new tactics ultimately theres a ton of variations that do alter the game play and it has really never been a concern that came up anywhere including focus tests if you havent played through to level 50 you have most likely not seen all of the games enemy variations
8422878 i suspect every developer fights an internal battle between the best art possible and the code and compression limits available at the time art fights for the highest art fidelity and code fights for speed and memory allocation of that fidelity my office walls are covered from floor to ceiling in concepts direction overviews and in game production renders people are genuinely surprised at the level of planning and accuracy of the translation from concept to 3d model as for the visual style of too human the characters we first made concepts of in 2004 are the model translations you see in the game today the art direction that was laid out for the xbox 360 has remained true to that vision
8422879 when we first started out it was an adaptive system that mixed music elements in and out of the existing mix this was very similar to the way i produced the music for
8422880 the explosion system uses complex matrices of samples so that every explosion is unique and relative to camera utilizes the lfe channel in different ways if you have a home theater your sub will be very busy in a firefight with goblin missiles and such

8422984 for more than a century state governments have put parochial interests above the national interest and allowed this once great river system to be drained to deaths door
8422985 we know from the high courts decision on workchoices the extent of commonwealth power
8422986 that power should be used for the good of the entire river system and the communities that depend on it for their survival
8422987 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8422988 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8422989 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8422990 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8422991 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8422992 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8422993 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8422994 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8422995 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8422996 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8422997 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions

8423040 during the consultation process around removing unprofitable payphones a number of suggestions have been voiced by local people and local government
8423041 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8423042 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to maintenance costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated
8423043 when i went to england i expected the people to be friendly but they just arent
8423044 pitched our tents in mud and mire while the rich sat by the fire
8423045 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8423046 even with all the destruction carried out by the rice growers the supreme court decided in their favor
8423047 this is really a local conflict its about use of water about the farms getting bigger and bigger
8423048 now the indigenous people are saying enough this has been recognized as our land
8423049 the farmers want the indigenous land to be divided into islands they dont want the indigenous land to be a continuous tract of land but legal experts in brazil maintain that there is no legal basis to annul the 2005 demarcation
8423050 in relation to the accusations of money coming in from venezuela and farc rebels i have no evidence for or against it
8423051 but its fair to say that whenever theres some criticism or attack to be made against social movements in brazil the farc are always dragged out although very little evidence is ever provided to prove these allegations so it seems once again that its an attempt to criminalize social movements in brazil and discredit their work that benefits the poor and the marginalized
8423052 indigenous people across the amazon have persistently complained to amnesty and denounced violations committed by soldiers who work indigenous areas sexual abuse physical abuse and intimidation
8423053 there seems to be a clear contradiction in the sense that indigenous areas are meant to limit the access into those areas to guarantee their safety and protection yet when the army goes in there time and time again we see that indigenous rights are violated
8423054 we want to be clear on something fundamental indian lands are brazilian lands
8423055 there are no nations or indian peoples there are brazilians who are indians
8423056 this is something we see not only in the amazon but across brazil
8423057 the cultural social and economic rights of indigneous peoples tend to come into conflict with the economic interests of big agro industry and big agro industry has been the driving force of the recent economic boom thats occuring in brazil and weve seen that theres a lot of political and judicial support for their interests
8423058 in this case its not that the military has allied itself with the farmers
8423059 thats why the farmers are using economic arguments they are saying what we do is good for the state and national economy they call themselves the nationalist resistance they consider themselves those who represent the nation against the indians who are supported by foreign interests they never say who these interests are but by conflating the local conflict into this language of nationalism and development of developing the nation they were able to get closer to the militarys cause
8423060 a decision against raposa would create the legal precedents to revoke all indigenous titles to land in brazil
8423061 any other territory could be contested such as the yanomami kayap
8423062 what is on the line here is article 231 of the brazilian constitution and the indigenous rights that are laid out in that article
8423063 its not that the court decision will directly affect the constitution but the arguments that are being used go against article 231 it seems that the justice system is going to favor the big landowners and this will open up the way to revise article 231
8423064 the 1988 constitution allows indigenous people the process to set out and identify their ancestral lands
8423065 theres a real fear that this will set back cases across the country of indigenous peoples who continue to fight for the rights to their land and who through this process continue to seek the provision of their basic human rights and cultural rights
8423066 defined the rights of indigenous peoples over their lands and established that these rights enjoy over riding precedence over any subsequent rights granted to non indigenous holders
8423067 indigenous peoples are considered minors under brazilian law the demarcation process doesnt give them full rights to their land but allows the land to be held by the federal government in custody for them
8423068 it would seriously undermine the whole system of indian reserves in brazil if the courts were to bow to pressure from influential landowners and politicians particularly given the violence the indians have been subjected to
8423069 mark the future of development in brazil in relation to the amazon
8423070 will we continue a predatory model of exploitation that doesnt respect the law
8423071 or will brazil be transformed definitively into a country that develops itself sustainably and respects human rights

8423076 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8423077 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8423078 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama
8423079 ladies and gentlemen this the cause for which we stand an american president named barack obama who will lead and inspire the free world an american president named barack obama who will stand for the rule of law who will remember that torture is the way of the people who hate us and not our way

8423191 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8423192 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8423193 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8423194 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8423195 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8423199 ningu m colocou essa possibilidade e n o est na pauta
8423200 nenhum momento bom para se discutir mat rias pol micas mas se esta casa n o discutir problemas da sociedade quem vai discutir
8423201 we want to make sure that the very basic rights that workers need rights like being able to join a union bargain collectively and participate in debates about their workplaces and industries are front and centre of the new legislation
8423202 many are low paid and many come from non english speaking backgrounds
8423203 this is a terrible shock and i am feeling quite emotional
8423204 my husband phoned me this morning to get the news i cannot put into words the pain i feel
8423205 i do not know which way to look i doubt we can keep the shop open without the post office business
8423206 this will hit the elderly very hard i am not happy with the loss of any service and this is very unfortunate
8423207 i needed another five years and i would have been alright this is a devastating blow i do not know why we have been singled out but we are determined to fight the closure proposal i just hope the public backs us
8423208 we have noticed less customers in recent years but this is still a valuable local service its closure would hit people hard
8423209 these closures are not foregone conclusions i would urge people to take part in the consultation process and make representations to the appropriate bodies
8423210 i am very unhappy about this there are a lot of people especially the elderly who rely on the services provided here
8423211 it is important to have a post office in this area as the nearest one will be walsall town centre and it is too far to get too
8423212 i do a lot to help the elderly people such as collecting their pension and i am going to be lost without this there are a lot of senior people around here and will have a big impact
8423213 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
8423214 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
8423215 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
8423216 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
8423217 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
8423218 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
8423219 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8423220 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8423221 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8423222 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
8423223 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
8423224 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came onboard
8423225 the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
8423226 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
8423227 a coherent consistent narrative of who he is that weaves together the themes of his campaign with his life history
8423228 that is why i love this country ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
8423229 look after mommy and ill see you guys on thursday all right
8423230 personally i find it disappointing that from a membership of over 3000 people there are only such a small group of people who are willing to take the time out of their busy lives to attend this agm
8423231 it is a shame to think that our organisation does not mean enough to see more members attending
8423232 we are continually questioned about our relevance to the glbt community i consider our organisation to represent our community its history interests and future
8423233 in moving forward though we need to look at ways we can create a stronger sense of engagement
8423234 we went through extensive negotiations with the ppca this year and managed to get a reduced total package figure covering the whole season but there was a notation that they wouldnt be doing so in the future
8423235 so we are looking at ways to distribute those costs so that it doesnt all fall on the organisation we are also taking external advice on the matter
8423236 exploring the possibilities for an entirely new staffing plan for the entire organisation
8423237 exploring what was on offer in the market and what the costs might be
8423238 im going to be vice president of my fantasy football league
8423239 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8423240 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8423241 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that

8423251 the largest mosque in europe will by inaugurated on the first day of the international peacemakers conference titled islam religion of peace and progress
8423252 this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8423253 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8423254 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8423255 when alickovic visited the burned down building he ran into adem zilkic surrounded by persons who are known to the public as participators in all incidents over the last ten months especially those at the altun alem mosque and the ceremony for beginning the construction of the madrasah in tutin
8423256 these events are another confirmation that this para religious creations are not backing down from inciting incidents we are expecting the authorities to carry out investigations with the goal of confirming the causes of the fires and the protection of its officials property and members of the islamic community in serbia
8423257 there was no physical conflict between the imams of the two islamic communities

8423269 oh its a crime either way serves them right when it happens to them for designing that terrible park that way
8423270 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8423271 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8423272 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8423273 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8423285 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago
8423286 thats not the question on voters minds i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives and so in that sense this is going to be a more workmanlike speech
8423287 administrando el riesgo tecnol gico c mo proteger a su organizaci n de los ataques cibern ticos en base a buenas pr cticas de seguridad inform tica
8423288 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8423289 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8423290 theres always information coming forth regarding escapes and they told me that they monitor the situation they do due diligence they investigate the actual tips that come in and the intelligence and then they digest it and go from there
8423291 in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8423292 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8423293 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard
8423294 the northern territory emergency response has got a timetable in place
8423295 that timetable has demonstrated to us of course that income management as it was structured under the previous howard government was time consuming and difficult and thats in fact why we have moved towards a basics card to try to assist
8423296 its a case of meeting the requirements in the merchant agreement
8423297 im positive most of the businesses who want to participate should be able to meet those requirements
8423298 horse trading implies a willingness to vote for something you dont believe in in order to get something you want

8423300 for more than a century state governments have put parochial interests above the national interest and allowed this once great river system to be drained to deaths door
8423301 we know from the high courts decision on workchoices the extent of commonwealth power
8423302 that power should be used for the good of the entire river system and the communities that depend on it for their survival

8423311 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8423312 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8423313 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8423314 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8423315 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8423316 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8423317 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8423318 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8423319 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8423320 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8423321 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win

8423352 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
8423353 i basically told george that i was involved in the company as a major investor
8423354 and wanted him to be aware of it in case the issue ever came up
8423355 simmons seemingly greased every palm in the statehouse to smooth his radioactive plans with his company waste control specialists giving more than 2 million in political cash since 2001 while spending 2 8 million on 63 lobby contracts according to texans for public justice
8423356 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8423357 political contributions are dwarfed by my charitable contributions of 400 million
8423358 a provision in the tax bill included at the behest of several members of congress including freshman rep kenny hulshof r mo would have granted simmons something both he and 2 000 beet farmers in oregon desired a graceful exit out of a joint venture deal that they had struck for the sole purpose of reducing or eliminating altogether a bill for 80 million in capital gains taxes simmons was facing
8423359 to avoid capital gains simmons came up with a cumbersome arrangement form a joint venture with the snake river sugar cooperative a group of 2 000 oregon beet farmers formed for this purpose and have the joint venture own the refinery and share the profits under the tax laws this arrangement was not technically a sale and simmons owed no capital gains taxes even though the cooperative paid him 260 million in the deal
8423360 the new legislation would not provide me any additional deferral above what i have already received
8423361 reports of an additional tax benefit to me are based on inaccurate information and are incorrect
8423362 i strongly urge you not to use this important tool at this time
8423363 this is a vendetta against harold simmons and thats sad
8423364 they tried to shoot harold simmons and instead they shot our 2 000 growers
8423365 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8423366 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one

8423379 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term
8423380 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant
8423381 businesses that are most impacted by the share market have also held up
8423382 that demonstrates financial strength and the strength of our business model
8423383 we expect margins to contract by two to three percent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate
8423384 notwithstanding the short term pressures caused by markets our goal remains to deliver top quartile tsr performance over a five year cycle which means average annual growth of 15 percent in the value of an investment in amp
8423385 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix
8423386 in difficult market conditions like these we have a bias towards holding more capital rather than less
8423387 amp has demonstrated a disciplined approach to capital management in recent years and will continue to be responsive to changing market conditions
8423388 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry
8423389 obviously were really excited we made charts and very appreciative to everyone that bought the record this first week but at same time its really hard to sell records with all the people downloading nowadays were really happy that people still went out and bought it and we hope they enjoy it to the people that downloaded it we hope you come out to one the shows and at least sing along and have a good time
8423390 the whole album is based on the concept of nihilism the world as we know it was a fluke and there is no meaning in anything it is about pulling yourself out of society because everything makes you sick it is about purposefully leaving everything behind and destroying everything you think you love it is about hatred anger rage and resentment nothing is sure to me anymore everything has been tainted this album is pretty much exonerating myself from it all
8423391 the unearth tour is basically the support tour we have been waiting for
8423392 the lineup is one of the most diverse we have been a part of since sounds of the underground in 2007 and i cant wait to get out there and give what we have to offer we are going to be playing a good number of new songs so dig in and learn those words

8423415 they are spending their last months making it more difficult to put needed protections for workers in place in the future
8423416 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8423417 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection
8423418 to slip through a rule that may have a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers

8423428 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8423429 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8423430 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8423431 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8423432 are continually quoting to me things that the illustrious holmes said to my namesake
8423433 too much geography too much oceanography and too much bathyography too much of all the ographies
8423434 thankful that such imagination as i myself have is more prosaic and seated further from the heart

8423439 we live in a moment right now where we are color blind and color mute we act like we dont see it and we dont talk about it or name it

8423462 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8423463 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8423464 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8423465 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8423466 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8423467 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8423468 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon

8423491 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8423492 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8423493 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8423494 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing

8423648 this stop snitchin is going to be the end of us all if we continue to let it run our city
8423649 fear is not an option dont let me see you do it com
8423650 a lot of people think this snitchin theme affects only certain areas
8423651 its not just north phillys problem its not just west phillys problem its everybodys problem no one should dismiss the fact that this is going on
8423652 these kids dont understand that death is permanent death is real
8423653 thats when i saw the difference between dead ends and roads that continue through life
8423654 you can walk three blocks and find just about any drug you want
8423655 theres a group that says dont snitch this is the opposite of that if you do it and i see you do it im telling its as simple as that i dont want to go to a funeral were trying to deter this stuff from getting into our neighborhood
8423656 then the neighborhood gets taken over at that point you have an uphill battle
8423657 we need to get more involved in ending this snitchin concept so many lives have ended and weve seemed to reverse our values theres no honor in this code just chaos
8423658 we are committed to protecting the shore and its visitors and will prosecute to the full extent of the law anyone found to have violated our criminal statutes by dumping this waste in the ocean

8423663 come fa luomo ad essere protagonista in questi giorni di meeting abbiamo incontrato molti uomini che sono venuti qui a parlare a partire dal proprio cuore testimoniando un bisogno di bene di senso e di essere utili nella storia davanti ad alcune testimonianze come quelle di rose marguerite e vicky tutti siamo stati provocati e ci siamo sentiti pi protagonisti
8423664 protagonista colui che vive il reale mosso dal senso che ha incontrato nella propria vita
8423665 luomo per sua natura aspira ad essere protagonista ha esordito desidera che la propria vita lasci un segno originale lidea che la vita scorra senza generare nulla insopportabile
8423666 luomo fatto per essere in rapporto con ogni cosa creata per cercarne il senso e per conoscere il reale con lepoca moderna nelloccidente per maturata la convinzione che luomo fosse in grado da s autonomamente di dominare e definire il reale confidando nelle proprie capacit limmagine di protagonista che noi abbiamo ereditato quella di un uomo che si identifica con quello che riesce a fare da s e con il successo che riesce a ottenere
8423667 luomo moderno fu proiettato in s stesso nella chiusa interiorit dellintrospezione dove tuttal pi poteva sperimentare i processi vuoti del meccanismo mentale perfettamente concepibile che let moderna cominciata con un cos eccezionale e promettente rigoglio di attivit umana termini nella pi mortale e nella pi sterile passivit che la storia abbia mai conosciuto
8423668 o non ci riguarda oppure ridotta a ci che di essa noi decidiamo di scegliere
8423669 chi ha raggiunto lo stadio di non meravigliarsi pi di nulla dimostra semplicemente di aver perduto larte del ragionare e del riflettere
8423670 totalmente opposta rispetto a quellimpeto positivo presente in uomini come dante alighieri secondo cui ogni creatura era segno del mistero le cose tutte quante hanno ordine tra loro e questo forma che luniverso a dio fa similiante
8423671 protagonista non vuol dire avere la genialit o spiritualit di alcuni ma avere il proprio volto che in tutta la storia e leternit unico e irripetibile
8423672 non viene da una capacit o da un discorso un fatto io non mi sto facendo da me il mio io fatto da un altro e la consistenza della mia personalit sta in questo rapporto che mi genera
8423673 le due concezioni in lotta tra loro sono quella delluomo che appartiene a qualcosa di pi grande oppure quella delluomo che appartiene a se stesso
8423674 la sua pretesa di autonomia lo rende schiavo della mentalit comune un io cosciente della propria irriducibilit invece inassimilabile a qualunque potere
8423675 un eccesso di comunicazione e di possibilit di scelta favorisce lo smarrimento dellio come ha detto benedetto xvi luomo minacciato da uno squilibrio tra le possibilit che ha e la debolezza di giudizio del cuore
8423676 luomo rapporto con la totalit come descrive mirabilmente dante nella sua opera
8423677 luomo questo paradosso un quasi nulla che ha la capacit dellinfinito ha detto bersanelli e gente come dante pascal leopardi dostoevskij e giussani ha capito che ogni uomo ha una grandezza incommensurabile
8423678 sia il potere sia luomo stesso tendono a ridurre la sua libert come dice don carr n lunica possibilit di ridestare lio un avvenimento un amore incontrato una presenza che afferma il tuo essere il cristianesimo questo invito inaspettato che cambia la vita
8423679 il potere dello sguardo di ges che alla vedova a cui era il morto il figlio dice donna non piangere ci affascina di pi della boria di certi politici per questo non ci avranno mai
8423680 the bill does not consider the issue that consumers tend to be confused about the confidentiality of their communications in this kind of blurred advertising context if consumers thinking that their communications with their pharmacist are protected under hipaa which they are then take the step to call the phone numbers and use the web sites in the advertising their pharmacist gave them then those communications from the consumer are not covered under hipaa pharmaceutical companies will be able to use all consumer information they acquire for direct to consumer marketing
8423681 the opt out language in this bill is onerous for consumers there is no clear strong prohibition on the marketing use of opt out infomration by any companies contacted for opt out purposes
8423682 fourth the sponsorship disclosures are inadequate all paid advertising disclosure should also include a very prominent disclosure next to any advertising contact information that informs consumers that any information they give through calling the phone numbers or giving information to the advertisers web site will not be covered under hippa consumers need to clearly know that their coommunications with advertisers are not protected under hipaa

8423690 being on stage is such a thrill and its great to be a part of an ea video game that lets girls experience how much fun it is to express themselves and explore their own creativity by performing

8423692 we have combined the very best interactive capabilities of the wii technology with the boogie brand to form an unprecedented soundtrack featuring the hottest new tracks made famous by the biggest artists in the world weve been actively involved in natashas career since its inception and were proud to have a star like her actively involved
8423693 weve been cooperating and discussing how to have a unified convention with the obama campaign
8423694 and i think were off to a real good start
8423695 it was almost like a goodbye but not a goodbye
8423696 my thing is i think obama can be a good president the difference is i know hillary clinton would be a good president
8423697 any disunity that might be there is on the shoulders of barack obama
8423698 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8423699 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8423700 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
8423701 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
8423702 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
8423703 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
8423704 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
8423705 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

8423715 as part of that tradition i am here today to release you as my delegates
8423716 i want you to know that this has been a joy
8423717 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8423718 i have spoken to many of you who have expressed your questions about what you should do now many of you feel a responsibility to represent the voters in your state and others of you after this long journey want the chance to vote for whats in your heart now still others will be voting for sen obama because they want to demonstrate their personal commitment for the unity of this party behind our nominee i am not telling you what to do you come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you
8423719 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call that we have candidates who look for ways to work to make sure that we come out of here ready to win in november
8423720 at the end of today we will nominate and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
8423721 bet plenty of you republicans and puma members are truly disappointed
8423722 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8423723 p arty u nity m y a ss but in reality a puma is most likely a republican who is pretending to be a scorned hillary supporter to try to make obama look bad
8423724 are you people for real i mean get a grip if you are for hillary or obama arent we all democrats for heavens sake they ran on virtually identical platforms one person won the nomincation fairly by winning the majority of delegates yes even including the contested mich and florida delegates there was no conspiricy that is the way the democratic primaries work they work this way every 4 years there is nothing unusual about the way this convention is being conducted except the immature way the press and the public are acting
8423725 we are thrilled to have the support of ibm and f5 networks for the sixth annual software development best practices

8423728 she wont last the day all her body functions have shut down even her brain shes almost gone we are keeping her alive with the machines im sorry
8423729 it just did she just sat up opened her eyes and asked what had happened
8423730 at 8 oclock exactly when the nurses came around with breakfast
8423731 i looked at the clock on the wall there when they brought in breakfast
8423732 theres so much contradiction out there who knows what to believe anymore ill just eat what i want and take my chances
8423733 following a secondary screening she was found to be in possession of what appeared to be cocaine and heroin
8423734 i think last year they didnt have the quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8423735 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8423736 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8423737 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8423738 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8423739 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top

8423852 there are not over a hundred people in the united states who hate the catholic church there are millions however who hate what they wrongly believe to be the catholic church which is of course quite a different thing
8423853 on august 24 pelosi contested the fact that the catholic church has always been unequivocally opposed to abortion
8423854 cardinal george pell archbishop of melbourne australia wrote in his 1997 book issues of faith and morals that st
8423855 nor does her argument gain strength by pointing out that not all catholics agree with the church on this subject
8423856 maybe thats the source of pelosis confusion she really doesnt understand the difference between the teaching authority of the catholic church and the dnc
8423857 a second distinction separates official church teaching from the expressed opinions of individual ecclesiastical writers the church may consider various opinions without adopting them as her official teaching for example in 1679 a decree of the holy office under the authority of innocent xi condemned the positions of two important writers of that century thomas sanchez and joannis marcus sanchez a jesuit theologian held that abortion is lawful if the fetus is not yet animated when the intention is to prevent a girl detected as pregnant from being killed or defamed marcus the proto physician of bohemia claimed that the fetus lacks a rational soul until birth
8423858 in the course of history the fathers of the church her pastors and her doctors have taught the same doctrine that human life must be protected and favored from the beginning just as at the various stages of its development the various opinions on the infusion of the spiritual soul did not introduce any doubt about the illicitness of abortion it is true that in the middle ages when the opinion was generally held that the spiritual soul was not present until after the first few weeks a distinction was made in the evaluation of the sin and the gravity of penal sanctions excellent authors allowed for this first period more lenient case solutions which they rejected for following periods but it was never denied at that time that procured abortion even during the first days was objectively grave fault this condemnation was in fact unanimous
8423859 from the time that the ovum is fertilized a new life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother it is rather the life of a new human being with his own growth
8423860 the exact time when the fetus becomes animated has no practical significance as far as the morality of abortion is concerned by any theory of animation abortion is gravely wrong why so because every direct abortion is a sin of murder by intent it is to say the least probable that every developing fetus is a human being to deliberately kill what is probably human is murder
8423861 whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked upon as a moral dividing line between permissible and immoral abortion

8423866 we have a pretty wide tent in terms of the kinds of advertisers we hope to partner with
8423867 we have a clear editorial point of view with regard to the kind of programming we run whereas hulu is more of a generalist secondly its not just about the videos with us the site is as much programming as it is about the games and video mashups that users can create we sought to create a more immersive experience

8423973 building verification environments for both asic and fpga designs is a core competency of ours and using the tried and true vmm methodology enables us to quickly customize an optimal verification flow that helps us meet each of our customers unique requirements
8423974 by developing vmm compliant verification environments and supporting the verification flow with a complete set of user documentation we significantly improve efficiency for our customers by allowing them to focus on the task of verification without worrying about the implementation details
8423975 our adoption of the vmm methodology gives us the ability to build a structured robust verification environment that contributes to our pioneering work in the field of asic and ip design and verification for the networking computing automotive and industrial markets
8423976 pairing vmm with the design methodology we have employed successfully for over 20 years helps us drive a reuse philosophy as a result we have built up a valuable library of design and vmm compliant verification elements that allow us to develop technology for our customers in a timely cost effective manner
8423977 verilabs experience is that methodology standardization is one of the biggest challenges in verification even within a single client company
8423978 when that company has large development teams spread across several sites or countries deploying an effective methodology becomes absolutely crucial we have found that vmm can act as a key component in such a deployment and we have been using it to good effect over the past three years
8423979 the open source vmm base class library and applications are proven mature and deployed by hundreds of design teams across the globe making the vmm methodology the solution of choice for systemverilog based design and verification
8423980 innovative services companies are adopting vmm due to its ability to facilitate the easy deployment of robust reusable and highly configurable verification environments users and synopsys continue to enhance and expand vmm with new technologies such as the recently announced vmm lp which provides a verification methodology for low power designs

8424011 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
8424012 houstons great strength has been its ability to stop political and commercial elites from capturing control and denying houstonians the ability to make their own decisions about how and where they wish to live and work
8424013 i was privileged to spend two weeks during may in houston the lasting impression i have is the refreshing and commitment of the houstonians i met from all walks of life characteristics often lacking in other urban markets currently suffering housing stress houstonians need to understand and appreciate the reality that your great city is indeed a global leader with respect to its political culture and urban governance and importantly that this is being increasingly recognized both within the united states and internationally
8424014 the idea behind focusing on accessibility instead of mobility is that if cities are designed so that people are close to shops and services they wont need to drive as much or as far the problem with that idea is that consumers rely on a competitive market in retail and services to promote innovation and keep costs low consumers who are captive of one or a limited number of stores end up paying higher prices often for lower quality goods moreover even in a world with limited energy supplies there is no guarantee that having local stores within walking distance of residential areas is the optimal pattern some experts in the retail industry suggest that higher energy prices will give an advantage to big box supercenters where people can do all their shopping in one auto trip
8424015 why wont workers cluster around their jobs as they did in the 18th and early 19th century a number of very forceful reasons

8424018 after setting forth our capital and credit plan august 8 we are now putting a senior management structure in place to drive this plan across the company
8424019 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the us housing and mortgage markets as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities and we have to organize and staff accordingly

8424027 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8424028 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8424029 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8424030 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8424031 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8424050 although i did find it a gripping read it does share with many memoirs the trap of both post facto knowledge and factual errors both are relatively minor in his case one is his reference to a nazi with high boots doing selection at auschwitz when they arrived although he does not name the nazi in question it is clear from his references that it is mengle the holocaust museum in washington had a very simple rule when doing oral history interviews of auschwitz survivors if they claimed that when they arrived in auschwitz joseph mengle was there at the station with his high boots on they would not use the interview because that was post war imagery imposed upon wartime experience since he did not name mengle and just described a scene i was not too worried the other example and this is the sort of thing that only a real geek like me would know is that while he was in auschwitz allied planes accidentally bombed it they were aiming for the buna works nearby berg said they were b 17 flying fortresses in fact they were b 24 liberators long story how i know that claire suggests that maybe i spent too much time in high school at home on weekends

8424052 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8424053 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8424054 to eliminate wasteful projects and pay offs to special interests we will impose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system and reform the appropriations process through full transparency
8424055 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8424056 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today

8424060 the america that we know that the founding fathers envisioned will cease to exist
8424061 sometimes the problems have to get larger before you can solve them we can still drive around the potholes so they must not be big enough

8424070 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
8424071 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
8424072 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8424073 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
8424074 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
8424075 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself

8424088 and im also a bit superstitious i never claim it out loud we just do the work i dont want to jinx it
8424089 i dont want too get to far ahead of myself because i think just from a sanity perspective its always better to be in the moment to figure out what we have to do today tomorrow and the next couple of days
8424090 so i try not to get too far ahead of myself and that may lead me to be more of the kind of person that if this is something that was meant to be it will be
8424091 to sit back and say i cant believe this is happening i cant believe were doing this the anchor asks the candidates wife in excerpts provided by

8424096 since weve always had the same taste in music we recently decided to put our lack of musical talents together to start the jellyfish bandits

8424100 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8424101 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8424102 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8424103 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months

8424108 he was going to visit finland for the muslim holy month of ramadan that begins next weekend where he was to partake in the opening ceremonies but now hell be denied that
8424109 literally over both head and feet in a poem written around 60 bc others such as robert hendrickson
8424110 he gave him such a violent involuntary kick in the face as drove him head over heels
8424111 i soon found myself head over heels in love with this girl
8424112 but suddenly he came flying from the nearest mountain and tumbled heels over head beside them
8424113 geralds pole which he had stuck rather deep in the mud came away with unexpected ease at his third tug and gerald promptly shot heels over head backward into the water
8424114 these people are not welcome in the society because they are against the social natural and religious rules
8424115 yes but those are the acts of extremists not the mainstream
8424116 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
8424117 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
8424118 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
8424119 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
8424120 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
8424121 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
8424122 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
8424123 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
8424124 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
8424125 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
8424126 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
8424127 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
8424128 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
8424129 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
8424130 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
8424131 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
8424132 be the change that you want to see in the world
8424133 i remember every morning i would just have such heavy thoughts on my mind what am i going to say to him what am i going to say
8424134 for the past 16 months theres many things i wanted to say to him
8424135 and now this is probably the last chance i would get
8424136 i think justice has been served it doesnt bring them back and its not a happy occasion for us because we loved jimmy but he has to pay for the crime that he committed
8424137 i would have liked to see more time but i feel it was just
8424138 i wanted as much from the judge as we could get he deserves it
8424139 this is something we would like to give to you

8424145 a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government

8424151 a ziggurat was a temple tower of the ancient mesopotamian valley and iran having the form of a terraced pyramid of successively receding stories or levels some modern buildings with a step pyramid shape have also been termed ziggurats
8424152 those guns need to be taken off the streets for the safety of everyone in this country
8424153 gun factories are very rare they were weapons used solely for killing
8424154 depending on the time well make the temptation bigger and bigger the idea was to see if anybody would be dumb enough to choose comfort over the only thing that guarantees you to stick in the game immunity
8424155 by the time this season is over you can make the case that maybe this is the dumbest team when it comes to idol play
8424156 did you know that 9 11 was an inside job carried out by certain western intelligence agents so we could invade afghanistan and re instate the global drugs trade which the taliban wanted to eradicate amongst other things
8424157 dont just take my word for it go on the web google alex jones do your home work the truth is out there if you care to look for it

8424166 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8424167 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8424168 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8424169 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8424170 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8424171 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8424172 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8424181 father forgive them for they know not what they do
8424182 isnt t i the name of the scientific calculator that i paid too much for in college
8424183 the guy that dissed the big named dude early in his career
8424184 over the past several years continuing numerous and substantial leaks and water infiltration has occurred at the new elementary schools
8424185 these leaks and water infiltration caused damage inside the new elementary schools and presented potential health hazards to the children teachers and other occupants of the new elementary schools
8424186 you could certainly draw the inference that we were not able to get cooperation
8424187 we want the vendors that did it to do the repairs
8424188 it definitely was not a district issue and we need to get those buildings fixed
8424189 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi told the convention senator obama accepts the nomination
8424190 im not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give michael madigan a hug
8424191 look whenever you hug a guy you ought to be upbeat about it
8424192 i just wonder if its the altitude well find out when we get back home
8424193 a hug a dance a wink a nod these guys have been doing the two step for five years
8424194 theres more to do and i like my job and i have no reason to think i dont want to keep doing this job
8424195 so i dont know whether it is genuine or not
8424196 theres a difference in approach weve applied a common sense approach thats the way mike madigans done it for more than two decades and thats the way its going to continue
8424197 i think were focused on the november elections and barack obama
8424198 making mental ill health in prisons an even bigger problem
8424199 it is inevitable that prisoners in huge jails far from home will lose touch with their families and friends and end up leaving prison rootless and unskilled
8424200 the more prisoners there are the more ex convicts you will end up managing this countrys very high reconviction rate shows that prisons are currently failing to rehabilitate convicts while often destroying families and jobs
8424201 titan jails are a bad idea but it would be equally wrong to ignore the state of prison overcrowding we must address this problem and we cannot simply empty our jails of serious or repeat offenders
8424202 the right way forward is to build smaller local prisons with a new focus on reducing re offending and in this way arrest the growth in prisoner numbers
8424203 titan prisons will be a titan nightmare for those communities unfortunate enough to have these massive complexes built on their doorstep
8424204 over the course of the year the communities near titan jails will see thousands of prisoners spat out of the gate with no prospect of sensible and safe resettlement
8424205 quite frankly these are perfect market conditions for the drug trade and will inevitably result in local crime and disorder
8424206 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come said juliet lyon the trusts director
8424207 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high
8424208 we believe that investment in community sentences and in smaller units for those who need to be in custody especially for women and children are better ways of solving the prison crowding problem than building titan prisons
8424209 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8424210 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work

8424237 another day brings another gloomy prediction about the british economy
8424238 the brown bubble has burst and thanks to labours economic incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8424239 the upshot is that after growth of about 1 2 per cent this year we now expect the uk economy to contract by about 0 2 per cent in 2009 we previously forecast growth of 0 5 per cent
8424240 this projection is well below the latest consensus forecast of 0 9 per cent
8424241 but these developments wont prevent the economy from slowing further over the next year or so
8424242 it is quite plausible that they fall even further than this
8424243 as a result of this new negative data consumer and business surveys consistently show that the fear of an actual recession dominates

8424280 you know theres going to be trouble when you open up your closet and its made out of painted cinderblocks
8424281 word just in to our newsroom causes us to break into our regular program of discussion and expert evaluation of events on the national scene
8424282 early reports indicate that the airliner has been struck by a wing part that became detached from a u s military hercules aircraft on a routine patrol it appears that an aileron fell from the wing of the hercules and dropped into the path of the passenger jet during its passage to bwi
8424283 the separated aircraft part is said to have struck the airliner in the vicinity of the cockpit news is arriving here in our newsroom all the time and we will update you on this story as soon as possible
8424284 here is an update on the report i gave you earlier about that all britain international passenger jet that experienced a freak accident off the eastern seaboard about 1 600 kilometers 1 000 miles short of bwi airport
8424285 first lets start with the one from the white house the president has issued a statement to confirm that this is not an act of terrorism it appears he said that this is billion to one accident that could not have been foreseen
8424286 second it has been confirmed that the u s a f c 130 hercules aircraft has landed safely without incident the crew of the aircraft is reported in fine shape the group is extremely concerned as to the reason
8424287 also the ten member crew expressed deep anxiety for the crew and passengers of the airliner hit by the falling aileron
8424288 the air force supplies the c 130 aircraft from time to time on contract to n o a a the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for weather patrols
8424289 here at national news we share the crews sentiment because a third report we have received indicates that b 747 the falling aileron hit the four engined airliner in the area of its cockpit
8424290 eye witness accounts seem to say that less than half of the mechanism can be seen protruding from the stricken jet it is possible that the crew if they have survived at all may be severely incapacitated
8424291 not only would they have had to contend with the physical impact of the falling object which the jet struck at a speed approaching 800 kilometers per hour 500 miles per hour but also the explosive decompression that would have resulted from the penetration
8424292 all britain international airlines has released a statement which shows the total number of individuals on board the aircraft to be sixteen crew and three hundred and nine passengers including fifteen children and forty one infants
8424293 the cabin staff are reportedly in radio contact with the companys headquarters at gatwick lgw airport london but the fate of the flight crew is still unknown
8424294 here at nnn well be watching this story very closely and will bring you another update when it becomes available to us
8424295 a further package of information has been handed to me related to the midair strike on the all britain international airlines airplane about 1 600 kilometers off the virginia coast
8424296 the aircraft has now been completely identified to us as a boeing 747 436 which is equipped with the very latest avionics equipment
8424297 youll remember that an aileron from the wing of a u s air force hercules aircraft fell and struck the airliner while it was on its way toward bwi from london in mid afternoon
8424298 late eyewitness information has been received by way of n
8424299 information that has arrived here indicates the flight was on automatic pilot at the time of the incident and the jet was performing normally about two hours out of bwi when the accident happened
8424300 from all britain international airlines at gatwick we have learned that the chief purser has advised that physically all of the passengers are in good shape although that they are highly traumatized by the probable loss of the flight deck crew in addition the cockpit door is locked from inside but this would be normal procedure since higher security provisions were put in place following the 9 11 attack on the twin towers of new york citys world trade center the cockpit door is also reported to have been penetrated and blocked by a section of the hercules aileron that was the original cause of the incident
8424301 too well likely need a qualified b 747 pilot and someone who knows where the black boxes are located although we can sort that out on the telephone
8424302 dj its ethan ive got two ntsb experts waiting for pick up in washington a b 747 pilot waiting for you at gatwick and a two member nnn crew waiting here in nyc with me for pick up total of six at three locations the ntsb guys know the locations and retrieval data for the black boxes that ok with you
8424303 im leaving now ill pick the three of you up first can you get up to the roof right away its easier for me to get you from the roof rather than mess around coming right into your office
8424304 count on it the address here is the same as before youll see us on the roof im getting someone to call all britain and get them to hike their 747 pilot up onto the roof of one of their hangars at gatwick and ill let you have the details when you pick us up
8424305 ok well get the folks in washington after we have you on board to london for the skipper then on to the plane
8424306 before i dive down ill release the automatic pilot first and check if my initial impression is correct i can always re engage the ap without losing too much of its present direction
8424307 ive reset the automatic pilot to keep us on a straight and level course instead of being in a steady descent mode so can you follow me down to 3 000 metres so we can get together a little lower down
8424308 i think the boys in the cockpit are all still alive can we offload them through the system and you get them dropped off at a hospital where they can be cared for asap
8424309 can you ntsb guys give fergy a hand with getting the flight crew offloaded into the house here bruce greg better be very careful theyre already pretty badly knocked around dianne do you folks have any rubber gloves the lads can use
8424310 on the way lyndsey is the best at first aid so she can help with the injured ethan
8424311 if need be could you set the automatic pilot to land the aircraft at bwi fergy
8424312 actually bruce id much rather see it go to jfk or even back to gatwick in both of those locations all britain has the facilities to repair this aircraft and get it back into the air maybe try to recoup some of the losses that are going to be arising because of this incident
8424313 what about recovering the black boxes fergy the pilots of this plane might have been at fault in some way and if those boxes are destroyed later itll be impossible to prove either way we could use djs system to recover both black boxes while fergy flies toward bwi then unload the passengers and cabin crew and get them to safety and then you can take the aircraft empty to jfk or gatwick so long as there is enough fuel in the tanks
8424314 i can show you where the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are located and you can take them with you if you like it might be better though just to take the fdr and leave the cvr where it is for now just in case i run into trouble later on
8424315 if the cvr is still working it will already have recorded over the digital transcript of what happened when the hercules aileron came into the window here it runs in a loop and only records for about one hour so well just take the fdr and hope that we can get some data from it if for no other reason than the fact that it will let boeing know how its aircraft responded to the strike
8424316 deej would you be willing to be on standby in case fergy gets into difficulty
8424317 it would be a pleasure do you still have our number
8424318 i sure do can national call you just before fergy gets to gatwick so that you can help him disembark in case anything goes wrong
8424319 sure i can even go to gatwick and get a few extra crew to help with the flight if fergy needs
8424320 it would probably help to relieve the boredom i hope because ill be flying well below the jet stream and due to the loss of pressure in the cockpit thats going to be a flight of up to 12 hours
8424321 can you raise london on the company frequency when the time comes and have them get a boeing 747 captain and a qualified flight engineer ready on the roof of hangar two immediately and we can get them as soon as we finish offloading the passengers
8424322 are you sure theres enough fuel to get you back to gatwick skipper
8424323 positive theres enough fuel in the tanks to get to lax and then back here again
8424324 these guys are near to being frozen to death they must have been in that open cockpit for well over an hour
8424325 we still have to offload the passengers and the cabin crew and get them over to the airport we must be getting close to bwi can you turn the aircraft around to give us a little time to disembark them all its going to take us a while to handle a group of that size
8424326 i can do that ill raise baltimore on the radio and ask atc for permission to do a 180 about face and also to fly east for about forty five minutes at 3 000 metres
8424327 fergy could you contact the cabin staff on the company frequency and ask them to meet us at the aft end of the aircraft near the rear galley that way it will be possible to evacuate most of the passengers without arousing too much curiosity and perhaps avoid a panic
8424328 i dont want a f king abortion clinic in my neighborhood
8424329 senator obama is proposing to use the government to remake economic policies in a way that hasnt been seen in washington in decades
8424330 whats needed is organizations under the clintonian guidance and organizations like puma and just say no deal or the seeds to that clintonian democratic movement this will honor bill and hillary especially hillary
8424331 education is a weapon whose effects depend on who holds it in his hands and at whom it is aimed
8424332 a black person should never be called a republican because it is an insult
8424333 a black person should never be called a republican because it is an insult
8424334 this represents a parallel approach for how to make cells in regenerative medicine
8424335 and now that its shown that you can turn one of your cells into another it makes you think of what other cells youd like to convert
8424336 its a system thats easier to manipulate than getting a new stem cell to turn into something you want
8424337 the kind of work done here has the promise to go into clinical practice in a relatively short time
8424338 weve made a cell type but we havent yet made a whole tissue
8424339 if youve got extra cells of one type and need another why go all the way back to a stem cell
8424340 where i will spill the beans on everything i know about the industry and how i made cartooning my only job this class is not for beginners

8424346 we cant afford four more years of letting the american dream fade we cant afford four more years of forgetting the middle class
8424347 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8424348 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8424349 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we didnt win the national title very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot
8424350 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8424351 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8424352 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8424353 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8424354 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8424355 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8424356 we were hoping they would find in our favor but i think its the reinstatement committee that we really need to talk to
8424357 the staff pretty much did what it has done in the past in this case but the reinstatement committee has the authority to make its own decision so thats where our hope lies
8424358 that was tough on ben to be told it was denied then no wait then to be denied again was a terrible experience
8424359 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8424360 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8424361 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8424362 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8424363 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8424364 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8424365 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8424366 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8424367 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8424368 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8424369 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8424370 there are stark differences on the economy senator mccain thinks were on the right path and senator obama knows most people disagree with that
8424371 mccain is wedded not just to the bush economic policy but also to the bush foreign policy
8424372 senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs about the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona at the mccain estate
8424373 right and if dirt were dollars i wouldnt have a care
8424374 m is just so unimaginative and unoriginal they have no taste
8424375 jazz has been the active ingredient in every kind of joyful gathering
8424376 but really john mccain is out of touch and out of step with the american people he may not know how many houses he owns but there is one house the american people cannot afford for him to move into
8424377 the economy is awful we are on the brinks of a recession that might even escalate into a full blown depression yet john mccain thinks the fundamentals of our economy is strong maybe hed understand the shape of our economy if he didnt think that anyone making less than 5 million dollars a year is middle class
8424378 for what we have spent for just one day of the iraq war we could have funded 95 364 head start places for children
8424379 we now have a national debt of over 9 trillion dollars and rising but
8424380 john mccain thinks we should remain there for another 100 years
8424381 gas at the pump approaches 4 dollars a gallon but john mccain is so out of touch that he thinks drilling off shore would actually lower the gas prices today when the reality is that this is simply not possible because consumes 25 of the oil but has less than 3 of the reserves
8424382 john mccain opposes a renewable electricity standard and has consistently voted against such a standard in the past
8424383 meanwhile john mccain favors billions in new and existing subsidies for dirty dangerous and distracting nuclear power
8424384 if key clean energy incentives that are in danger of expiring soon are not renewed it could cost more than 116 000 hardworking americans in the wind and solar industries alone their jobs
8424385 and we are supposed to be a country that strives on
8424386 and yet i see nothing but hypocrisy from the republican party
8424387 john mccain loves to make himself look patriotic with his war stories and pow tales and he can never cease to shut up about how he believes in
8424388 forced to carry pregnancies to term when when their health could be in danger
8424389 or where the child has been conceived through rape or incest
8424390 there is absolutely no reason that anyone who cares about owning a piece of the american dream should vote gop ticket
8424391 soon we could all have nothing because we failed to vote for the issues
8424392 after losing a defamation case brought against him by businessman selwyn cushing peters was ordered to pay 135 000 in damages and costs there was widespread speculation about who paid the bill even then peters maintained he had no knowledge of the donors to his legal fund the national business review reported him as saying it was all dealt with by lawyers i have no idea about any of it nbr 28 aug 1998
8424393 the result which is beginning to emerge is a business that is growing significantly faster than the industry a business with higher margins and sustainable diversified revenue sources
8424394 we will also continue to push for leadership in the consumer banking space having invested significantly in distribution infrastructure product development technology and human capital
8424395 its been a long campaign and the whole team are really pleased to be back home and very proud with what has been achieved
8424396 its really difficult to gauge the mood of the public but no one expected the level of this reception here
8424397 its quite overwhelming its an incredible reception youre living in a bubble in the olympic village and its only when you land and see quite how many people have turned up you realise its incredible
8424398 its been a long pressure build up and its going to be nice to switch off and see friends and family and do normal things again
8424399 i think thats ridiculous to be honest it seems crazy
8424400 im having a month off and then getting back in the water

8424413 in the end it came down to whether or not my endorsement was for real or if it was just something that was said off the cuff it wasnt said off the cuff it is real i think obamas the better person for the job
8424414 the resources we have right here at home from domestically produced natural gas including liquefied natural gas from alaska to biomass wind and solar

8424418 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown
8424419 of course this does not mean that unemployment will rise by anything like three million but it does show just how jittery people have become about the economy and their own job
8424420 put growth first by doing all they can to restore confidence and boost investment

8424424 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8424425 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8424426 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8424427 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8424428 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea

8424453 generally across the board weve had a strong us dollar in the past month he said from auckland this morning
8424454 there comes a time when the market takes a breather and takes a position
8424455 maintains the stability and public confidence in the nations financial system by insuring deposits supervising financial institutions and managing receiverships
8424456 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8424457 australian children are exposed to more junk food ads than children in any other country in the world and obesity levels are rising
8424458 if the souffle falls just serve it with whipped cream and call it your grandmothers pudding it will still be delicious
8424459 we voted them into office in 2006 and they have not done their job
8424460 were going to put gi resistance at the forefront of this nation
8424461 my brothers been to iraq four times and he doesnt disgrace the uniform
8424462 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8424463 its a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time and theyve done a very good job with difficult situations in all aspects
8424464 so they made the call wrong once in a while weve all done things wrong once in a while
8424465 im really looking forward to this weekend and serving as grand marshal for the detroit indy grand prix
8424466 im a big race fan and its going to be awesome to be a part of the event this will be a great way to end whats been a memorable summer before we head back to work on the ice in september
8424467 a lot of my success in football has to do with my upbringing
8424468 my parents always pushed me through whatever i wanted to do not only my mom dad i mean my wife yvonne is awesome at home with the kids when im up here its a big part of where i am today
8424469 when im at camp i like it that theyre home my kids get to see their grandparents
8424470 no matter how big the crowd he always finds us in the stands
8424471 i enjoy it when they come to watch me play
8424472 its part of the reason why im here im happy when i see them in the crowd
8424473 he took his shirt off his back for our family when his kids were small they used to come watch dominic play at nebraska
8424474 i talked to uh about him already but they want to see tape on him
8424475 boises after him san diego state portland portland state coach jerry glanville already offered him a scholarship
8424476 he set the parameters for my life i saw him go to college made all american who better than to look up to even now i still look up to him
8424477 as much as i want to see him i can sacrifice and let my wife see him play
8424478 he was a big part of workouts every day those values carried over to the field its real life its not 24 hour fitness
8424479 i didnt think it was realistic to think like that
8424480 it was more just being in awe to be with those guys id grab all the shoes and gloves they would leave behind at the time i wasnt thinking that way
8424481 it would be awesome if olin made it and i made it with him
8424482 that would be special i think but thats more like personal goals more so than anything than the success of the team if i left the nfl right now i would be known as guy who played hard but lost all seven years he was there
8424483 he wins 12 15 games every year he must be really good
8424484 the yankees are 3 7 in the games pudge 8 days ago
8424485 the bottom line is it is a nuisance for us
8424486 the crew is working with teams on the ground to eradicate the virus and look for actions to prevent that from happening in the future
8424487 this is not a frequent occurrence but it has happened before
8424488 i just dont think its right to give a guy one start
8424489 he did a good job down there in toledo he wasnt great tuesday obviously but we didnt help him much i just think it would be hard not to give him at least another shot to be honest with you
8424490 he was called up because our third baseman is out
8424491 and this is the time to take a look at him and its another left handed bat replacing a left handed bat temporarily while carlos is out but im making it perfectly clear carlos guillen is our third baseman as soon as carlos guillen is healthy and ready to play hell be back at third base and he will play however many games he can the rest of the way out

8424497 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8424498 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8424499 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8424500 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8424501 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8424502 he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness
8424503 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
8424504 as a black christian these types of remarks are extremely disturbing as they in no way reflect the level of scriptural literacy knowledge of theology history and methods of biblical interpretation bishops and other church leaders should possess
8424505 thats not godly wisdom but rather sheer ignorance have they forgotten that the witness of the bible was an integral part of william wilberforces british ev angelical politicians argument for the eradication of the slave trade and later slavery
8424506 slavery is never glorified in scripture and in the new testament it is a situation that should be avoided there is a clear trajectory from conditional practice and tolerance e g exod 21 1 11 deut 23 15 16 etc towards an end where emancipation is a moral imperative in philemon paul makes a compelling case for onesimus a slave to be welcomed as a brother in christ rather than the continuation of his pre imprisonment status as philemons slave the bible is very clear that god has always intended for people of all races cultures and classes to be fully reconciled with him we see this throughout the old testament e g gen 18 17 19 ps 67 4 is 49 6 is 56 7 is 60 3 5 dan 7 14 mal 1 11 and certainly in the new testament e g mt 12 18 mt 28 19 mk 13 10 lk 2 32 etc in acts 15 james justifies the acceptance of the gentiles by the church not solely on the testimonies of peter paul and barnabas but by appealing to scripture c f acts 15 13 21
8424507 a biblical justification of slavery can only be made by ignoring and distorting the spirit letter and trajectory of scripture clearly unacceptable methods for exegesis and formulating hermeneutics
8424508 for the church the matter of homosexual behavior can never be a
8424509 the bottom line is that christians who are not married must accept and embrace celibacy regardless of the intensity or type of their sexual desires
8424510 sexual preference or practice is a behavioral issue and therefore is never comparable to race as i have said many times being black is not a behavior and to quote another inspired source i have never met an ex black
8424511 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
8424512 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
8424513 you cannot compare slavery with homosexuality slavery is a sin homosexuality is not about rights its about how god created you
8424514 weve often misinterpreted scripture weve used scripture to justify slavery the subjugation of women and now were realizing that what the bible initially seems to say about same sex relationships is not actually what were talking about today faithful monogamous lifelong intentioned relationships between people of the same sex
8424515 because they can we have 700 men here do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do the most devout christians beat their wives many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
8424516 xbox 360 is thrilled to partner with ea sports for this campaign to help enhance the fan experience through gaming

8424528 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8424529 i am proud to be one of 18 million who stand with hillary clinton
8424530 i see our broken health care system through experience an experience shared by too many people
8424531 were all going to cheer and scream for barack obama but as a salute to senator clintons campaign and the reason we are here is because of her we felt it was right if we vote for her and do anything we can to honor her contribution
8424532 hey dude did you see the article about the guy getting shot in the face
8424533 man sometimes our lives seem hard unbearable even but then we meet kevin or lydia or ray and realize again how lucky we are how hard some humans have it man and yet he smiled he smiled for me this man with his face blown off by his own hand and here he is in the sunshine listening to music smiling

8424565 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
8424566 imagine if tomorrow you could announce a new energy plan that would in one stroke cut your constituents gasoline bill in half reduce oil imports improve our air quality enhance national security strengthen the dollar reduce greenhouse gas emission and create tens of thousands of new jobs in the u s
8424567 theres a possibility that under our feet are the same kind of shale gas deposits that you have in the united states
8424568 there are many of the same types of shale formations in europe
8424569 the europeans have to hope that these shales will do for them what eastern shales have done for the u s gas supply which is to boost the main supply that is coming from the gulf of mexico
8424570 that would reduce the prices the russians were able to charge the final consumers in europe
8424571 shale is the most significant domestic natural gas find in 50 years
8424572 just when i was about to change that and wreck my life the cops came and saved me

8424576 we are deeply saddened by the loss of the three members of the campus community
8424577 the timing of this tragedy just as were about to start a new semester hits all of us particularly hard
8424578 offers our deepest and sincerest sympathies to all those who knew attended class or worked with lindsey plank richard putze and daniel myers in particular our thoughts go out to their parents and families during this time of grief
8424579 she was the funny girl everyone always knew her for her humor and her personality she was always smiling and always telling something funny
8424580 she could have had her own food network show she made absolutely awesome meals from scratch it was one of her big passions
8424581 people will always remember her for her humor everyone liked her and she liked everyone
8424582 she was more than willing to talk to anybody and be friends with everybody she was always there for you if you needed somebody to talk to
8424583 no matter how you were feeling if you needed a lift she was the person you went to to get that funny story that exciting happy positive outlook on something if you needed a laugh or some happy thoughts she was that person
8424584 she was an absolute one of a kind spirit her unique energy was always a blessing to be around
8424585 she was an amazing sister that was there whenever i needed her and the hardest worker ive ever met
8424586 i wanted to glide above the smallness of the world like she did she didnt waste time because she was passionate and seemed to choose happiness i want to live more like she did i imagine she left a gaping hole

8424588 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8424589 i want you to know this has been a joy boy did we have a good time trying
8424590 i believe that as democrats and as americans we will leave denver united
8424591 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call that we have candidates who look for ways to make sure we come out of here ready to win in november
8424592 as part of that tradition i am here today to release you as my delegates
8424593 ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8424594 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8424595 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8424596 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8424597 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8424598 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8424599 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8424600 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8424601 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8424602 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8424603 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8424604 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8424605 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8424606 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8424607 the minneapolis star tribune is the latest paper to cancel ap service in washington the spokesman review of spokane canceled around the same time that the bakersfield californian cut ties several smaller newspapers have joined in in ohio eight of the top newspapers including the cleveland plain dealer the columbus dispatch the cincinnati enquirer and the toledo blade decided to create their own network the ohio news organization now they share local news without submitting it to the ap

8424611 creationism is true because the bible says so and the bible is true because i say so
8424612 its possible to counter a rush because its common in games and it is common in games because i saw so

8424620 generally across the board weve had a strong us dollar in the past month he said from auckland this morning
8424621 there comes a time when the market takes a breather and takes a position
8424622 it is a normal measure used in most markets by regulators

8424627 willing participant in the plan to keep the justice department from knowing about and opposing
8424628 it should be us policy now to treat an iranian attack on israel as if it were an attack against the united states
8424629 we should be looking to create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than just israel of course i would make it clear to the iranians that an attack on israel would incur massive retaliation from the united states but i would do the same with other countries in the region you cant go to the saudis or the kuwaities or uae and others who have a legitimate concern about iran and say well dont acquire these weapons to defend yourself unless youre also willing to say we will provide a deterrent backup
8424630 you drill you find oil and well take away your profits
8424631 been willing to skirt basic protections that are in our constitution it is my firm belief that we can crack down on threats against the united states but we can do so within the constraints of our constitution
8424632 in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in us prisons incapacitated
8424633 we all know our countrys journey toward equality isnt finished yet we have more work to do

8424652 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8424653 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8424654 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8424655 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives

8424670 commit to a project to build a chip fabrication plant
8424671 it was such big news for the region it got built up a little bit and people made a natural assumption that this means that were building a new fab
8424672 when in reality all that was really announced in 2006 was that we had this option to build a fab
8424673 this is about their books and their finances more than their operations
8424674 its about getting rid of the capital requirements for manufacturing
8424675 when the new york deal was done in 2006 amd was well on its way to ascendancy in terms of market share
8424676 the belief was that two current generation fabs would be necessary to satisfy full demand if they got to the 30 percent goal share of the x86 architecture chip market but theyre not at the goal theyre roughly in the 20 percent range
8424677 there may be some issues with amd having to retain controlling ownership in order to be ok with patent licensing agreement with intel
8424678 probably end up with some entity thats halfway between amd and some other concern with a very interestingly structured contract built around it
8424679 the whole reason for asset smart was that the fabs that they owned were a drag on their finances add another plant on top of that that would not be the most prudent thing
8424680 the option to build the fab in upstate new york is going to be a piece of the asset smart strategy
8424681 we need to announce the asset smart strategy first and get all those pieces locked into place first and then well be in a position to announce what well do with the malta fab 4x
8424682 the content itself was not a problem what set the chinese government off was the concern over a potential protest in the olympic village apple was a target only to the extent that it was seen by the chinese authorities as aiding that protest

8424685 following a secondary screening she was found to be in possession of what appeared to be cocaine and heroin
8424686 the department of revenue did a thorough and complete job and followed the law in making its decision
8424687 is they decided to apply a standard of review that is very favorable to the department of revenue essentially they went down a path that requires them to uphold the departments decision unless they find it very erroneous thats a tough standard to overcome for the hospital
8424688 always completely focused on the person he was with whether patient or colleague
8424689 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8424690 i saw one circling the tree in barber close and it went off towards grange park i think its quite fascinating it was very bright orange

8424692 my husband called the police and while he was on the phone i called one of my neighbours out
8424693 she went inside and rang her husband and he said he could see them from chase farm
8424694 but when i spoke to the police they told me there had been lots of other sightings that night

8424697 a vast amount of products is available but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards
8424698 we will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health
8424699 one product we found called original herbal ecstasy contained nutmeg which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants
8424700 yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications they could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis
8424701 there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated websites
8424702 there is no guarantee of safety quality or effectiveness it could be counterfeit or out of date it may not contain the right amount of medicine there is no ongoing treatment monitoring at worst it may cause severe side effects its not worth it
8424703 the aim is that you can go online and call up the scrolls with the best possible resolution and all the information that exists about them today
8424704 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown
8424705 of course this does not mean that unemployment will rise by anything like three million but it does show just how jittery people have become about the economy and their own job
8424706 put growth first by doing all they can to restore confidence and boost investment
8424707 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8424708 let us declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8424709 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8424710 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8424711 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8424728 top 10 who are changing the world of internet and politics
8424729 the social liberal party of denmark made the first open political community in denmark launched on the 26th of september 2007 it became the first danish attempt to take the knowledge from the american campaigns and use it to 1 revitalize the party structure making it easy to participate for everyone 2 opening up the party debates to anyone interested in the subject closed party member debates are otherwise the rule in denmark 3 giving everyone with an interest in the party the resources needed to contribute in the election campaign
8424730 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8424731 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8424732 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8424733 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8424734 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8424735 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8424736 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8424737 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8424738 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8424739 i know youre jealous and it doesnt seem fair ill fill everyone in on it friday if im awake ive been told there will be hours and hours of waiting in line
8424740 i think its quite interesting in the context of mr seseljas work ethic the workload that hes accepted and the energy that hes put into his work as a member of the assembly that in four years hes tabled three bills
8424741 rich for a government that has shut down debate throughout the last four years and has used its majority to prevent this kind of legislation from coming on it is a bit rich for them to be criticising us for the number of pieces of legislation
8424742 also when did melissa ethridge become the democratic partys official musician i dont like her music cant we have ludacris perform his obama song instead
8424743 im looking forward to bidey turning up the heat tonight jay rockefeller is booooooriiiinnnnnnngggggg

8424746 power of our example vs the example of our power
8424747 i think this conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8424748 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8424749 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8424750 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8424751 john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades
8424752 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8424753 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8424754 remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as president theyll look to us again
8424755 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8424756 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8424757 will lead us away from division and fear of the last years back to unity and hope
8424758 in 2004 we came so close to victory we are even closer now and let me tell you this time were going to win
8424759 just like the past just like george bush and this country cant afford a third bush term
8424760 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place unfair burden on the heroes of our armed forces
8424761 john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8424762 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country
8424763 lets declare with one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8424767 1984 or nazi germany you must take back your party and we must take back our country said
8424768 hes not as bad as you guys paint him out to be
8424769 after all its true that hillarys and obamas positions are much more similar than hillarys and mccains
8424770 people will be looking to understand the rationale besides party loyalty and party unity what is the specific rationale behind his support of barack obama

8424790 i dont have to heal you if i dont want to i paid for the game
8424791 ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career ive lost almost 300 games 26 times ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed ive failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed
8424792 to learn how to use a sword one must first master when to use a sword
8424793 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8424794 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8424795 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8424796 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8424797 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8424798 for this day the chicken doth cluck and it clucks for thee

8424802 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
8424803 we remain concerned that the recent issues will prevent acceleration of the lar timeline and could delay approval if the incidence rate increases or further safety studies are required
8424804 further the characteristics and complications of the pancreatitis cases in patients on byetta are consistent with pancreatitis in the general population
8424805 we believe byetta continues to have a positive benefit risk profile for patients with type 2 diabetes
8424806 unless i looked right into it and read everything you wrote as well as looked at each career builder
8424807 also i did a word search and you didnt even right the word skirmisher in that first page so how is anyone else suppose to know you were making a skirmisher build
8424808 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8424809 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8424810 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8424811 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8424812 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8424813 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8424814 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8424815 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8424816 the sea levels arent rising folks look how low it is
8424817 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8424818 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8424819 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8424820 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8424821 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8424822 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8424823 thought about it and opted for west coast which i live in her hometown on the west coast

8424832 simo non mi toccare i capelli che hai appena pisciato se voglio metterti i capelli nel cazzo lo faccio
8424833 da piccolo avevo un coccodrillo lavevo chiamato caco poi si bucato ha deciso di farsi
8424834 io ho un particolare filtro in bocca tipo i gatti
8424835 mi hanno fatto 5 foto di fila e ho salutato la retina
8424836 che labbroni ti sono venuti ti sei fatto di bettulino
8424837 a me piace un uccello strano aspetta come si chiama

8424839 un mio amico ha tirato un pugno alla porta e si spaccato il ginocchio
8424840 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8424841 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8424842 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8424843 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8424844 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8424845 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8424846 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8424847 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8424848 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8424849 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8424850 the days he practiced out here was going 100 he looked like shawne merriman to me
8424851 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do
8424852 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8424853 i think we need to see the united states and see the world through eyes that are younger through eyes that have dreams through eyes that see something new for the nation
8424854 n s temos que fazer o dever de casa nesse jogo estamos tendo uma boa seq ncia de jogos no canind e n o podemos desperdi ar essa chance de somar pontos
8424855 uma das primeiras coisas que eu disse para os jogadores que eu n o tenho uma varinha m gica n o poderemos fazer nada fora do normal e tudo que vai acontecer na seq ncia do campeonato brasileiro depende de muita entrega e muito compromisso da nossa parte nos pr ximos 16 jogos n o s nos 16 jogos mas nos 103 dias que faltam at o t rmino da temporada
8424856 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would come his way whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it
8424857 foi um bom dia de trabalho sempre interessante poder completar tantas voltas monza o circuito mais r pido do ano ent o testamos nosso pacote de baixo downforce a pista estava bem suja o que n o ajudou muito mas estou satisfeito com o set up que consegui embora ainda tenhamos muito a melhorar
8424858 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8424859 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8424860 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8424861 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8424862 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8424863 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8424864 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8424865 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8424866 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8424867 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8424868 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8424869 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8424870 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8424871 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8424872 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8424873 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8424874 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8424875 you have no idea what its like to be a black man and be coughed on
8424876 in a year of firsts for presidential candidates a phenomenon thats taking even seasoned analysts by surprise a growing grassroots movement born on the internet to elect a virtual unknown to the highest office in the country

8424887 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8424888 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8424889 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8424890 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8424891 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8424892 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8424893 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8424894 the sea levels arent rising folks look how low it is
8424895 to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
8424896 i get a feeling that people are trying to become more individual at the moment and buying secondhand clothes is a way to do that
8424897 there has been exposure of certain high street retailers who have not been clean as they should be in their supply base so if you want cheap clothes and a clean conscience then a charity shop is an obvious route
8424898 for shoppers who love the dig and delve experience of shops like tk maxx there is really not much difference in going to a charity shop it is all about enjoying the experience of finding a bargain
8424899 a certain section of consumers are turning their back on fast fashion and like the idea of recycling
8424900 we are not in that place where charity shops used to be where people come to us because they have no money and nowhere else to go we think we are much more attractive as somewhere where you can find unusual interesting and one off pieces of clothing sales are driven by that and we have put a lot of work into getting better quality and interesting donations
8424901 you can get clothing as cheap or cheaper at supermarkets and value shops
8424902 this end of the market should do well when householders are hard up
8424903 but there is a problem in whether we can find enough quality donations
8424904 nous lavions indiqu hier des contacts ont t nou s avec alain perrin toutefois nous navons pas trouv daccord

8424906 man muss den polizeifunktion ren nur zuh ren um zu ahnen welchen staat sie sympathisch finden
8424907 i think that i would give the benefit of the doubt to the person who alleges that
8424908 he believes that women are capable of making their own decisions
8424909 for it was you who created my inward parts you knit me together in my mothers womb
8424910 we believe that legislation concerning abortions will not address the root of the problem we therefore express our deep conviction that any proposed legislation on the part of national or state governments regarding abortions must take special care to see that individual conscience is respected
8424911 problem pregnancies are the result of and influenced by so many complicated and insolvable circumstances that we have neither the wisdom nor the authority to address or decide each situation the considered decision of a woman to terminate a pregnancy can be a morally acceptable though certainly not the only or required decision possible justifying circumstances would include medical indications of severe physical or mental deformity conception as a result of rape or incest or conditions under which the physical or mental health of either woman or child would be gravely threatened we do not wish to see laws enacted that would attach criminal penalties to those who seek abortions or to appropriately qualified and licensed persons who perform abortions in medically approved facilities by affirming the ability and responsibility of a woman to make good moral choices regarding problem pregnancies the presbyterian church u s a does not advocate abortion but instead acknowledges circumstances in a sinful world that may make abortion the least objectionable of difficult options
8424912 our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion but we are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well being of the mother for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy in continuity with past christian teaching we recognize tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion and in such cases we support the legal option of abortion under proper medical procedures we believe that continuance of a pregnancy which endangers the life or health of the mother or poses other serious problems concerning the life health or mental capability of the child to be is not a moral necessity in such a case we believe the path of mature christian judgment may indicate the advisability of abortion we support the legal right to abortion as established by the 1973 supreme court decisions we encourage women in counsel with husbands doctors and pastors to make their own responsible decisions concerning the personal or moral questions surrounding the issue of abortion
8424913 the final decision whether to terminate the pregnancy or not should be made by the pregnant woman after appropriate consultation
8424914 neil am i correct in assuming then that you believe that the human soul is created at the instant a sperm enters an egg
8424915 you see for jesus followers who support reproductive rights for women that is the right to have their unborn children crushed and dismembered without anesthetic the question isnt whether abortion is a good thing or not
8424916 the issue is women should not be labeled or slapped with a stigma if that is the course they choose take that is the course to have their unborn children destroyed for any reason
8424917 they should fear neither legal nor societal penalties for choosing to have their unborn children murdered
8424918 those who claim to follow jesus should not exacerbate an already painful decision making process and prevent the destruction of innocent human beings
8424919 but first the fundamental flaw in most of the reasoning here is that theres a bit of implicit misogyny being passed around
8424920 this is the primary reason that i believe the decision belongs to a woman
8424921 the humanist compassionate response to unwanted pregnancy is to allow a woman in a position that you are not in to make her own decisions about how an unwanted pregnancy would affect her life
8424922 and fyi the surefire way to prevent most abortions from happening would be a comprehensive sex ed program that focuses on preventative measures like birth control
8424923 a poor cohabiting teenager using the pill has a failure rate of 48 4 you read that correctly nearly half of poor cohabiting teenagers get pregnant during their first year using the pill over 70 of poor cohabiting teenagers using condoms will be pregnant within a year by contrast the middle aged middle class married woman has a 6 chance of pregnancy after a year of condom use
8424924 oooh dna see the thing is dead people have dna too so does our hair and a skin cell and our fingerprints are they also separate entities with free will and rights 46 chromosomes do not a person create
8424925 are they also separate entities with free will and rights
8424926 some of the churches you quoted have apostate views on marriage the divinity of christ and his exclusivity for salvation as well just because a church or a person says they are christian doesnt mean they are
8424927 it looks like the only moral stance to take is to allow women the right to their own decisions
8424928 it looks like the only moral stance is to allow women the right to have their unborn children crushed and dismembered for any reason
8424929 so the episcopalians the presbyterians the church of christ the methodists and the seventh day adventists are all false churches then
8424930 anti choice to crush and dismember an innocent human being you can call me anti choice all day long but id appreciate it if youd finish the sentence
8424931 denying women our rights to choose when and how we give birth
8424932 however consider the spontaneous abortions and miscarriages that occur in nature not to mention the majority of abortions women undergo these are not baby shaped beings
8424933 deliver the baby 90 out of the vaginal canal then puncture her skull with scissors and without anesthetic then suck out her brains and deliver her
8424934 its not a far step from controlling womens sexual choices to denying them any at all
8424935 most of your words are rehashing the same point namely that you believe a fertilized egg is a person with inherent free will and legal rights
8424936 saying that women have no choices about their childbearing removes part of the rights men enjoy which is a wee bit discriminating no
8424937 god and i have talked and we understand each other presumably you and god have talked and come to a decision also isnt it great that god doesnt force us to do anything like agree
8424938 when a woman destroys the life of her unborn child it is a sign that by education or circumstances she has been greatly wronged
8424939 is the woman guilty yes no matter what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed it will burden her conscience in life it will burden her soul in death but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime
8424940 blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the children of god
8424941 i have to apologize yet again for people that identify as the same gender as me
8424942 id wager that many of you support the death penalty
8424943 suffering is suffering and the painless elimination of a non conscious person shaped clump of cells is obviously on a different level than the socioeconomic stigmatism ostracism and suffering of an impoverished single mother
8424944 pregnancy has the power to put careers on hold to cut education short and to permanently cap financial earning power
8424945 if we educated children in the same way they would have protection that is just as effective duh
8424946 everyones doing it just start whenever youre ready but always use condoms
8424947 anecdotes dont prove anything i know but im a young man in a committed relationship and i support the right to choose

8424987 weve given a lot of barely true ratings lately on our truth o meter weve been looking at the tv ads also at their speeches and its the same on mccains side its really the truth has been a casualty of summer
8424988 with the way that mccain and obama have been trading attacks youd think that were days away from election day rather than months
8424989 you say that the truth has become a casualty of that
8424990 w e wouldnt have expected these kind of attacks so early in the campaign
8424991 whats different is that were seeing many more inaccurate claims earlier than we would have expected
8424992 a grain of truth but the overall point is false

8425012 innovation has been a key to apples success over the past decade and without it the company would be nothing more than another computer vendor
8425013 but by releasing a mac that eclipses the functionality of the tablet pc and fully harnesses the power of multitouch in a way that no one has seen before apple can create the computing worlds first iphone like success
8425014 why apple and not dell or hp its simple apple is the only company in the market thats willing to risk failure to be the most innovative and beloved company in the space on top of that apple is the only company in that market that truly has a pulse on the desires of most consumers

8425019 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8425020 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8425021 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8425022 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8425023 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8425024 to revisit the discussion of two additional one stop sites in craven county

8425032 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8425033 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8425034 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8425035 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8425036 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8425046 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money
8425047 it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts
8425048 it is getting better now but i still think about it
8425049 i think he really liked it here but he obviously missed his friends and his girlfriend
8425050 he was looking forward to seeing his girlfriend he had bought her and his family lots of presents
8425051 he couldnt sit still at home and at work he was always bouncing around
8425052 we will have to try to devise ways of reducing traffic through there or speeding the traffic up
8425053 we might have a look at the movements of hgvs on the a339 there are a number of them still using that road rather than the bypass
8425054 we will have a look at that to see what traffic orders we might be able to make to stop them doing that
8425055 i am concerned that were not meeting these air quality standards
8425056 many of these standards are set very strictly and i would hope that they are really set to be so low that even if you go over the top weve got a fair amount of room before there is any danger
8425057 as a group we have decided to oppose this for a number of reasons
8425058 whilst we concede that there is a risk posed by glasses we believe that our customers are generally reponsible people and should be treated as such
8425059 polycarbonate glases are not pleasant to drink from and they quickly become clouded and appear dirty
8425060 although we acknowledge the risk we feel this is disproportionate perhaps pressure should be put on the manufacturers to find a safer glass product
8425061 it would be just one more nail in the industrys coffin
8425062 more and more people are drinking at home as it is and plastic glasses are not very welcoming i would feel a bit insulted if i was handed one in a pub
8425063 this could be the thin end of the wedge what next no bar stools because they could be used as a weapon
8425064 its unfortunate that the actions of a very few individuals have started this i think it sends out the wrong message about newbury and about personal responsibility
8425065 this is not a diktat we are simply exploring possibilities and trying to get agreement on this
8425066 newbury remains a very safe place but its force policy to encourage polycarbonate glases where appropriate the risk might be very small but the potential for injury is very great
8425067 in this case the young people were not even in a proper craft
8425068 taking an inflatable paddling pool near a weir is nothing short of reckless

8425075 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk
8425076 i can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by may 2009
8425077 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8425078 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8425079 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf
8425080 pelo esp rito de dedica o dos democratas com os olhos no futuro e com nosso objetivo de ganhar as elei es de novembro vamos declarar aqui e agora que barack obama o nosso candidato e ser nosso pr ximo presidente
8425081 eu pe o que a conven o suspenda a tradicional vota o todos os votos declarados pelos delegados ser o contados mas eu pe o que barack obama seja eleito por esta conven o por aclama o o candidato democrata presid ncia dos estados unidos
8425082 quem concordar com o encerramento da vota o e a nomea o de barack obama por aclama o diga

8425084 selain mendapat informasi soal kegiatan museum anggota komunitas sahabat museum juga dapat mengikuti kunjungan sejarah ke berbagai tempat di sumut
8425085 kami sudah menerimanya tidak hanya sekali tapi berkali kali yang terakhir sudah dibalas beberapa waktu lalu
8425086 temuan ini hasil pemeriksaan spi satuan pengawasan internal sekarang persoalan ini sedang dalam kajian direksi percepatan kerusakan ini membuat ongkos perawatan membengkak
8425087 maksudnya jika ada kerusakan sebelum usia yang semestinya kontraktor mesti ikut menanggung kerugian
8425088 mengingat permasalahan kasus dugaan korupsi tersebut pada saat ini sedang ditangani oleh kpk pimpinan dewan berpendapat sebaiknya pelaksanaan tugas dan wewenang badan kehormatan untuk menangani permasalahan tersebut sebagaimana diatur dalam ketentuan tata tertib dpr ri pasal 59 ayat 1 huruf a dilakukan setelah kasus tersebut selesai ditangani oleh instansi yang berwenang
8425089 waktu itu kami buru buru saja teken sebetulnya sudah diperintahkan yang isinya dijalankan saja
8425090 kami anggap tidak ada dokumen itu berarti ada yang iseng saja
8425091 aparentemente o mdc n o quer fazer parte do governo
8425092 desta vez eles o mdc ouviram a promessa dos brit nicos de que as san es ser o ainda mais devastadoras e que em seis meses o governo se afundar
8425093 eles consideram se o centro de tudo n o podemos confiar neles enfim n o em todos
8425094 evidente que se mugabe quer anunciar um novo governo isso ser considerado uma declara o de guerra contra o povo
8425095 mugabe pensa que nos est a pressionar quando diz que vai formar um governo em breve
8425096 temos o tempo do nosso lado temos o povo connosco
8425097 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8425098 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8425099 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8425100 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8425101 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8425102 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8425103 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8425104 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8425105 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8425106 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8425107 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8425108 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8425109 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8425110 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8425111 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8425112 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8425113 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8425114 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8425115 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8425116 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8425117 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8425118 who are open to doing something on the production side
8425119 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8425120 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8425121 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8425122 indian companies should take proactive measures to ensure adequate risk appraisal and management as well as leverage opportunities arising out of climate change they need to do proper due diligence for clean development mechanism cdm projects to assess the quantum of carbon credits expected to be generated indian businesses also need to consider tax and regulatory issues and devise strategies to help ensure that they can maximise the benefit from the cdm process
8425123 government priorities in the last five years or so have been very clearly environment security of supply and way down the list has been price all of a sudden affordability has shot to the top
8425124 if oil drops back to 80 then government can probably live with it the extra cost of climate policies
8425125 weve seen a worsening more to do with economic weakness than anything else its much harder to push through or in some cases even maintain support packages that push up energy costs when consumers are under pressure
8425126 if oil comes below 100 the consumer will bear it

8425132 most of the world is bemused by western moralising on georgia
8425133 should support the underdog georgia against russia most support russia against the bullying west the gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer
8425134 account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership

8425140 as a long term investor i am particularly alarmed by these results
8425141 revenues have declined and the performance of the uk operations in particular seems to be in freefall
8425142 current dividends now seem to be part financed by borrowings
8425143 although the statement pays lip service to a strategy of innovation and cost efficiency it seems clear to me that decisive moves are urgently needed perhaps starting with a close look at whether the independent and belfast telegraph are contributing anything worthwhile to the group
8425144 you dont have any time to think in there and they keep you hopping on both feet
8425145 it was a bit like going to the dentist its painful but you feel its done you some good afterwards
8425146 peter jones opened the tub and had a smell then he noticed shortly afterwards that it says do not inhale on the pot
8425147 he actually stopped the camera because he was terrified that he was going to die
8425148 i rescued peter jones and richard farley now i have two pet dragons they call themselves dragons and if you slay dragons and you keep them they become your pets
8425149 oh yes i left that show in a limousine and its been limousines ever since
8425150 she didnt get funding from them although they were very nice to her and gave her excellent advice off screen they giggled a lot too
8425151 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8425152 in response to the current challenging circumstances we continue to actively manage our cost base to achieve productivity gains and in a manner which will protect the long term prospects of the group we expect to deliver a result reflective of these initiatives and the difficult market conditions
8425153 im very concerned as to what they think of us
8425154 that is honestly the first time ive ever been asked that question ive been married and had the children today
8425155 there is no political intent in this film it is just funny
8425156 after reading the part that was handwritten for me i was not sure if i should be flattered or insulted im still a bit unsure
8425157 its a really funny script and we didnt see any reason to wander off course
8425158 we just thought lets do a spy movie because we hadnt done one before
8425159 its not a piece of reality tv its real tv its lovingly crafted
8425160 what is remarkable about the hughes family is that they are in many ways unremarkable i think theyre an antidote to some of the larger than life characters we see on television today
8425161 room room my gallant boys give us room to rhyme
8425162 some activity act of young and act of age the like of which was never seen on any stage
8425163 reporting to the fdic conduct which he reasonably believed to be unlawful
8425164 attempted in a series of meetings to intimidate fort into agreeing that many of his concerns should be ignored
8425165 after he engaged in gross neglect of his duties and repeatedly failed to perform as a member of tnccs management team
8425166 tncc took extensive actions to address correct and voluntarily disclose the concerns raised by plaintiff
8425167 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8425168 the new capital will allow us to accelerate production expansion for our 430 megawatt san jose factory and our 620 megawatt berlin factory
8425169 instead of rushing headlong into an expensive prison building programme the government must focus on addressing the causes of the growing prison population
8425170 building bigger prisons will achieve nothing clearly the government are looking to build titan prisons based on a need to save money
8425171 titan prison complexes will be the most effective way of providing value for money and reducing reoffending
8425172 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money
8425173 it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts
8425174 these are necessary to facilitate quick diagnosis so that treatment can be started soon this will prevent spreading of rumours of mysterious fever we expect that this demand will also be met soon
8425175 ini kan informasi yang sangat berharga untuk kami tindak lanjuti setelah ini memang harus ada perbaikan dalam laporan keuangan pemerintah daerah kami juga harus membenahi sumber daya manusia yang menguasai akuntansi
8425176 sumut memang banyak kekurangan tenaga profesional tenaga pendidik saja sumut masih sangat kurang pokoknya kami akan benahi persoalan kekurangan sumber daya manusia ini
8425177 ini laporan yang paling jelek saya tidak tahu kenapa padahal banyak orang pintar dari mandailing
8425178 selain itu konflik antara lembaga eksekutif dan legislatif juga ikut memengaruhinya
8425179 karena kpk yang memintanya kejati sumut juga meminta hasil audit ini tetapi karena kpk yang meminta dilakukan audit investigasi atas pengelolaan pnbp di usu kami hanya menyerahkan hasil audit tersebut ke kpk
8425180 pelaksanaan eksekusi mencari waktu yang paling tepat dalam 2008 kira kira sendiri bulan apa
8425181 kami ingin agar ada perbaikan dalam proses hukum jangan sampai kejaksaan sebagai eksekutor mengeksekusi berdasarkan proses yang tidak jelas
8425182 these laws were drafted with usaid assistance uu ini dirancang dengan bantuan usaid
8425183 inisiator uu migas itu dari international monetary fund lewat letter of intent imf mengharuskan indonesia mengubah uu migas nya imf menyodorkan uu migas jadi pasti ada intervensi asing
8425184 uu migas itu konseptornya pasti orang indonesia juga mungkin beliau beliau itu masih ada di departemen energi dan sumber daya mineral pertamina atau tempat lain

8425186 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
8425187 we are battening down the hatches it could be six 12 maybe 18 months
8425188 i think the single most important lesson is the speed of reaction slowing land purchases attacking costs hard
8425189 marginal projects will be put on hold as financial pressure on housebuilders intensifies and transaction volumes remain low pushing government housebuilding targets further into the wilderness a rapid policy rethink is vital if 2m homes are to be built by 2016 to achieve government targets
8425190 housebuilding is set to fall below 100 000 over the next year with housing starts already down 25 to reduce the excesses of this boom and bust cycle a more sustainable approach to housebuilding needs to be enacted sooner rather than later
8425191 jika ada yang berkata gara gara perubahan uud 1945 negara kesatuan republik indonesia nkri bisa pecah itu tidak benar
8425192 kita tidak usah terlalu sering menengok ke belakang negara ini tidak akan bubar ekonomi juga tidak akan ambruk seluruhnya karena kekayaan alam kita amat banyak masalahnya apa kita mau tetap seperti sekarang hidup enggan mati tidak mau
8425193 kalau perlu kita lakukan moratorium liberalisasi buat masyarakat memahami liberalisasi dan tingkatkan daya saing juga hanya buka keran liberalisasi yang menguntungkan kita
8425194 as a long term investor i am particularly alarmed by these results
8425195 revenues have declined and the performance of the uk operations in particular seems to be in freefall
8425196 current dividends now seem to be part financed by borrowings
8425197 although the statement pays lip service to a strategy of innovation and cost efficiency it seems clear to me that decisive moves are urgently needed perhaps starting with a close look at whether the independent and belfast telegraph are contributing anything worthwhile to the group
8425198 when he speaks he has the ear of everyone on the committee
8425199 they are aircraft and types of accident that are not related to each other at all
8425200 the geographical split has become more extreme over the years
8425201 accidents in north america europe and asia with the exception of indonesia have become fantastically rare
8425202 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8425203 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8425204 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8425205 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8425206 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8425207 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8425208 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8425209 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8425210 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8425211 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8425212 the uk had nothing to do with planting the story
8425213 the lib dems in westminster were quick to criticise the serious fraud office for dropping its inquiry into bae and its alleged dealings with saudi arabia
8425214 do their lib dem colleagues in towns where bae systems is an important local employer agree with them
8425215 people simply wont stand for letting the unions hold us to ransom any more
8425216 limiting the power of the unions was a painful process but a necessary one which we have now completed
8425217 literally asked the laboratories to physically take this device into the senate it was bigger than a breadbox and smaller than a dump truck but they were able to get it in
8425218 i was staggered when i saw the works a new sense came upon me a new heaven and a new earth stood before me
8425219 it is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world and is of supreme importance to scotland and the rest of the uk
8425220 they could be one of the greatest acquisitions we could ever make these are among the four or five pictures which would come to mind if one thought of what titian stood for as an artist
8425221 it is really important to realise that art is not there just for the country in its moments of affluence it is a major solace for times of difficulty most major acquisitions have been made against a background of economic distress
8425222 obviously his strongly preferred option is to sell them to the national galleries the price represents a huge discount i know the duke is extremely fond of these paintings they mean a lot to him
8425223 i declare with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that is our candidate and that he will be our president
8425224 it is traditional that we have a nomination that we have a roll call as part of that tradition i am here today to release you
8425225 theres a little bitterness and some of that will linger but the vast majority of her supporters are following her as soon as she gave her message supporting
8425226 i think a small percentage will sit out the election but a larger percentage of republicans dont like mccain and will vote for obama
8425227 aspetta prima noi e poi se rimane anche a te

8425251 its my first lead in a hollywood film which ive sort of resisted for years and years until the right project came along
8425252 this is certainly the right project because its funny i play a guy called bertram pincus im a dentist whos a loner very misanthropic grumpy hes sort of acerbic and thinks the world is surrounded by idiots he needed a hug but now he doesnt want one i die for a few minutes and i come back and can see dead people and they annoy me just as much as live people i have to do something for one of them in particular a guy called frank played by greg kinnear whos this sort of bullish artless guy who i just think is a neanderthal his widow is played by tea leoni and i have to do something for him which involves mucking around with a new relationship thats where the film really gets going
8425253 one should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth
8425254 what i think joe biden brings to the table is honesty
8425255 how to lose a sure thing presidential election in ten easy steps
8425256 yeah great idea lets all vote for an anti choice pro war bush clone
8425257 hillarys speech was impressive and her lengthy focus on the womens movement was not a call for unity it was a call for the female base of her support to never give up their fight clintons female supporters whom only represent a portion of the clinton base that is not falling in line will never take her speech as a call for unity and will only cement their belief that their fight is the right one
8425258 the roll call proceeded according alphabetically from alabama with mr
8425259 and the kicker is that not a one of them sees how patently adolescent it is i am at a loss for words to describe this fustercluck
8425260 this is the mentality that is racing to the 4th riech
8425261 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
8425262 let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of colorado
8425263 eu coloquei esse projeto em v rias reuni es de l deres mas nesse per odo eleitoral s votado o que for un nime

8425267 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the uk
8425268 no movement on the central question where was mr mohamed between 2002 and 2004
8425269 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk
8425270 i can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by may 2009
8425271 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8425272 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8425273 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf
8425274 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8425275 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8425276 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8425277 it is very very weird we have not heard anything we dont know whether they were in there or not
8425278 nobody knows until we can get access to the building
8425279 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people we have significantly disrupted an organised crime group that had been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks
8425280 he was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up
8425281 you are talking about blood money this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money he is selling the guns to the underworld just to kill people and its all because of greed
8425282 i think he the gun maker is as guilty as the people who are using the gun
8425283 it is clear that the usage in crimes in the uk of mac 10s can be directly linked to the factory at the briars
8425284 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets
8425285 next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance

8425287 until the age of 16 by which point she already had an adams apple a deep voice and facial hair
8425288 some parents whose children have gender identity issues are already angry about the fact that few professionals have been invited from abroad
8425289 the dutch data on gender suspension looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up
8425290 we wanted to tap in to the richest vein of popular british culture and theres nothing like rocknroll for that the bus was unmistakably london and when david beckham emerged that got the biggest cheer of the night from the chinese
8425291 it is one story in two halves an opportunity to remind the world what a rich vibrant eclectic diverse and influential culture we have
8425292 the presence of these squatters is delaying comprehensive refurbishment work to bring these properties up to the standard our troops and their families deserve
8425293 we just thought they were empty council flats going to be demolished had we known the mod were going to refurbish them we probably wouldnt have moved in
8425294 every night when i go to bed all i can hear is boom boom boom from their music its driving me crackers
8425295 we have complained so many times about the noise but we kept being told nothing could be done about it
8425296 there are people here from all over the world italians spaniards south africans portuguese
8425297 once we had a massive banquet for over 100 people and it was all free
8425298 i am not opposed to paying rent if someone was to look at how much i earned and work out a sensible amount to take for rent id be more than happy to pay
8425299 we have done all we can to help the property owners to remove squatters from limerick court as quickly as possible
8425300 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all i remember standing up in the bath one day and i was so thin i was never anorexic i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8425301 i remember i came back from a job in paris and the stylist said to me have you been eating too many croissants karen
8425302 fashion is obsessed with finding young beautiful and vulnerable girls bringing them into the fashion world praising them worshipping them but suddenly dropping them like a stone when they hit puberty and grow boobs and hips its so dangerous and can potentially harm the girls mentally and physically
8425303 the modelling industry has united against the certificates we therefore call on model agents to find a workable solution or an alternative and set best practice for the modelling industry
8425304 si adds air force customers whereas sercos business is exposed to the army and navy
8425305 the acquisition will also add to sercos capabilities in the us and increase its access to higher growth markets
8425306 we are seeing good growth in defence including in the uk and australia
8425307 we tend to get more phone calls from governments and private sector customers saying that they need to do more for less money
8425308 in defence if you have shrinking budgets people will stop procuring new kit such as airplanes and weapons
8425309 they will use what they have got and hire people who know how to get the existing product to go further
8425310 this is a business where we want to expand we will be absolutely keen to keep all of them
8425311 india already has a middle class of 200 million people and it is growing
8425312 it is a territory we are familiar with and we will take a look over the next few years
8425313 we have uncovered evidence that workers are being harassed and intimidated by 2 sisters management to deter union activity in clear contravention of us labour laws
8425314 this is in contrast with etis robust performance in h1 the first half when ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation was held flat we had taken this as reassurance that eti was outperforming the weak on trade beer market but the q3 third quarter data and trading update from july suggest otherwise
8425315 the next day or so could prove key for the uk market to see if this strength is set to continue this month has seen the ftse run out of steam ahead of the 5550 70 area once already and the temptation to book some profits on the back of the past weeks gains could prove too tempting for traders
8425316 it is more important that the group meet its 4bn target from disposals though recent comments from managements have raised doubt that it will
8425317 our sector view is cautious with the risk remaining to the downside net asset values will continue to be written down and earnings per share growth is coming under pressure
8425318 london office vacancy rates are increasing and retail sales volumes are down to recessionary levels in the last cyclical downturn this pushed rents down in both office and retail sectors this will continue to weigh on share price valuations
8425319 in valuing johnston press we believe that the market is overlooking trinitys more diversified revenue base
8425320 fifty per cent of trinitys revenues are derived from circulation versus 25 per cent of johnston and we favour trinitys national regional mix in preference to johnstons pure play regional exposure in the current environment
8425321 contrary to popular belief it is no longer the aocs highest quality wines that are responsible for the bitter aftertaste of our exports
8425322 regional wines which were really driving our exports have now broken down
8425323 the biggest difficulties were encountered in the anglo saxon markets which tend to like regional wines
8425324 the current problems with the exchange rate have affected these markets in particular and with them these wines from an extremely competitive niche
8425325 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8425326 the board is focused on how to maximise the value for the company and for its shareholders and we have been out to talk to other parties to see whether there is interest there
8425327 i am not really at liberty to say where we are in that process but it is something that we would continue to do with a view to getting to a more realistic value for tns
8425328 we just believe that the underlying value of this business is more than what has been put on the table
8425329 we will be spending the next few weeks going and talking to our shareholders both the hedge funds and long term holders both to gauge their position but also to put forward the arguments why we believe wpp should be paying more
8425330 it would be disappointing to see shareholders sell to wpp at this price because there is so much more value that can be delivered
8425331 the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns that was also economically in the best interests of the gfk shareholders
8425332 their experience in financial services will be of great benefit to rbs given the increasingly diversified and international nature of our powerful banking franchises
8425333 these changes demonstrate that the rbs board is getting to grips with its governance
8425334 this is a positive step rbs has been under pressure from the market to do this
8425335 the appointments are only a net positive it is a step in the right direction but until someone stands up to sir fred there will be no radical shake up at the bank
8425336 we do not regard these appointments as material for the share price it is more important that the group meets its 4bn target from disposals though recent comments from management have raised doubt that it will
8425337 g4s trades on a 2009 price earnings ratio of 10 8 times securitas trades on a 2009 11 9 times we believe g4s at the least deserves to trade on premium to securitas given the formers higher growth rate 11 per cent organic sales growth versus 6 per cent at securitas
8425338 you dont have any time to think in there and they keep you hopping on both feet
8425339 it was a bit like going to the dentist its painful but you feel its done you some good afterwards
8425340 peter jones opened the tub and had a smell then he noticed shortly afterwards that it says do not inhale on the pot
8425341 he actually stopped the camera because he was terrified that he was going to die
8425342 i rescued peter jones and richard farley now i have two pet dragons they call themselves dragons and if you slay dragons and you keep them they become your pets
8425343 oh yes i left that show in a limousine and its been limousines ever since
8425344 she didnt get funding from them although they were very nice to her and gave her excellent advice off screen they giggled a lot too
8425345 the city of baghdad has a depth of history and a cultural legacy that can be a basis for attracting and fostering tourism
8425346 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you
8425347 i bollocked people like gordon did i tasted my sauces like gordon i couldnt get him out of my head
8425348 im not going to be stopped from having my piece of the cake
8425349 gordons an important part of my life although half of me thinks hes a sad bastard he is not really part of the industry now hes a major celebrity
8425350 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8425351 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8425352 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8425353 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8425354 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8425355 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8425356 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8425357 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8425358 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8425359 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8425360 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8425361 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8425362 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8425363 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8425364 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8425365 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8425366 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8425367 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8425368 and if designs for painting stop a moment with his own and didnt know oo charlie was all these pages to examine the remains designs for painting cannot look at these get togethers and on this matter and designs for painting like him
8425369 if designs for painting dont quit this youll have a clue what designs for painting was regarded by a girl who is above 700 feet above the machine and there was no woman the regimental chaplain asked of grover watrous to his wits in 1860

8425380 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8425381 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8425382 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8425383 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8425384 analysis of historical claims data from aa insurance found that on average women made around 6 per cent more claims than men but their average cost of their claims was lower than men
8425385 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
8425386 a relatively high 15 per cent of men admitted they exceeded the speed limit most of the time even if only by a few kilometres per hour compared with only 9 per cent of women
8425387 therefore women have more accidents women are worse drivers than men

8425400 without that were goners im afraid there is nothing else
8425401 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth

8425403 regarding your second query you could retake your chemistry but clearly any applicant who had achieved aaa at the first attempt would have priority over you

8425408 o ne of my plans is to not allow lawyers to be rotated in and out of divisions as much as they have been when you have three or four lawyers handling one case then somethings going to fall through the cracks

8425413 im still at it food is my communication when i first arrived in france it was how i interacted with the locals because i only had high school french it got better of course one day i realised that without thinking i had said injector pump in french

8425415 europeans like new zealand products and i think they will love to come here but at the moment i am naive about what is available i do know though that both gascony and this south island are on the 45th parallel different hemispheres yes but i think we will have much in common
8425416 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8425417 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8425418 i felt like absolute shit as a teenager when i was modelling and all i had around me was people telling me i was right
8425419 the transformation of joe biden is one of the best story lines at this convention a week ago people would sprint from the room when joe entered for fear he would start a sentence that might not end until halloween now suddenly he is a towering stud muffin of charisma his every move is big news on tuesday the rocky mountain news ran a story headlined would be veep eats at boneys it stated that joe went to a denver restaurant called boneys barbecue which had been alerted in advance by the secret service i am not making this up to have smoked turkey legs ready however when joe got there he went with the pulled pork sandwich hes for change
8425420 we hatched a plan to produce a 3 inch non corroding disk which contained at least 1 000 translations of genesis and other linguistic information about each language

8425432 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8425433 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8425434 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8425435 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breath new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is
8425436 at the end of the day we are obliged to serve the best interests of the australian people and we could not let it pass through the senate knowing that australians would be paying higher prices for their petrol and that is something that we are not willing to countenance
8425437 and despite meeting the cost down demands of its customers the company has decided to let 80 workers go
8425438 we need better trade and industry policies to ensure that redundancies like these do not continue to occur
8425439 ten years ago pbr bosch employed over 1 200 workers it now employs half that that is a direct effect of the 10 years of neglect by the former government that saw 50 000 jobs lost from the manufacturing sector

8425450 each time they call me the pharmacy calls me or the police department calls me i always tell them one thing pursue the patient and arrest them

8425456 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8425457 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8425458 in the end though it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8425459 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8425460 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8425461 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8425462 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8425463 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8425464 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8425465 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8425466 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change
8425467 put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and come back ill never give up until i get where i want to go
8425468 venice 2008 is one of the clearest illustrations to date of the identity crisis the traditional all inclusive film festival is facing it has been clear for some time that the age of the auteur is over these days even dedicated high frequency viewers generally choose films by buzz rather than director
8425469 cinema is almost no longer cinema the type of classic contemporary cinema such as venice seemed designed to support has finally run out of steam the idea of a modern cinema that lasts 50 years is a contradiction in terms
8425470 we go look for the vitality of cinema wherever it is hidden be it in popular works or in auteur cinema it makes no difference to us
8425471 what you manage to accomplish at cannes and to a lesser extent at venice is a great junket but in venice the hotels are obscenely expensive and not very good it costs a fortune to rent interview space and the service is appalling then youve got the cost of the boats because all of the really big stars want to stay at the cipriani
8425472 if schools have evidence that the mark scheme for this years tests has been misapplied they should apply for a review and we will ensure the application is properly evaluated and where necessary scripts re marked
8425473 states with broad continental margins also have rights to exploit the resources of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles but they are required to provide the commission with scientific evidence concerning the location of the outer limit of the shelf

8425480 i am uncomfortable very worn out and my knee is sore
8425481 i have not met any of them yet so i am still not sure quite what to expect at the moment
8425482 but i am back in full training and like the conservatives im currently on the up and up
8425483 the tories should be more like margaret thatcher at least she hated poor work shy fools like me david seems to want my vote
8425484 have you recently been able to concentrate on what you are doing
8425485 have you been thinking of yourself as a worthless person
8425486 its a country pace rather than rushing about in the city the traffic problems are not so severe the countryside is magnificent and there are green fields everywhere just a short distance outside towns
8425487 of course weve all got our problems in the present economic crisis but people just go about their business and in these small towns theres a real feeling of community and also people are proud of their welshness which gives them a real sense of identity if you have that in a lovely landscape maybe thats why people are happy here
8425488 if they did 10 000 households for the whole of britain then how many did they do here
8425489 as far as i am concerned and many good people who live here relatives friends acquaintances people involved in the community and the economy we are happy to be within rhondda cynon taff yes we have had our difficulties but i firmly believe we are moving forward and have made good progress i believe that the outlook for rhondda cynon taff has certainly improved and is going to continue to improve
8425490 i would reject the idea that we are the unhappiest place in britain
8425491 theres a real sense of community in the south wales valleys how can you be unhappy when you have your friends around you
8425492 im a bit surprised i wouldnt say it was a bad place to live although maybe the living conditions could be improved when you compare the south wales valleys to cardiff which is only 25 miles away some of the facilities leave a lot to be desired
8425493 its wales people are pleasant and its just country living i suppose everyone seems happy and there are no city pressures
8425494 there really is something about the intrinsic nature of places which can influence happiness and wellbeing
8425495 the environment lack of green spaces air and noise pollution crime rates all of these influence happiness

8425511 this is a key step in getting the answers we need for our plans but also to share with other people who have questions
8425512 you know about the climate in juneau i dont know that a lot of folks are that excited to run quite honestly its just a flux year and thats why we see some democrats that are uncontested
8425513 its a real different election than it has been in many years i think people see an opportunity to go there and be in power
8425514 i really feel at the end of the day the majority of folks voting will vote for the republican candidate because they best follow their beliefs
8425515 theres never been a time when all the stars are aligned and every race from president to congress to the legislature are all in play weve never seen this before in our history and its very exciting to be a part of

8425518 the guy in front of me was going to the pro bowl
8425519 but wed talk a lot he had a different ability than i have i can run he had more agility and speed he could stop and start at the same speed where it takes me a bit longer to get my speed started and his vision id try to see what hes seeing and it was more difficult for me his vision was totally different
8425520 and his vision id try to see what hes seeing and it was more difficult for me his vision was totally different
8425521 everything happens for a reason everything happens in due time now i have an opportunity and im going to take advantage

8425523 with that support base i can get through a lot of things
8425524 a lot of guys come in thinking they are going to the nfl i came here first to get an education thats going real well

8425535 cant wait for his 10 year reunion so that he can tare down these double doors
8425536 there tends to be a bit of a safety issue in christchurch with people sticking to their blacks and browns so im stoked to see some real colour coming in
8425537 and its amazing how it just brightens up peoples mood straight away every second person who comes in here is grumpy with the weather and so i say put on some colour quickly
8425538 the belt gives it a more feminine shape it can be worn lower around the hips but that is not such a good look for me i like anything that gives me a waist
8425539 theyre nice and easy and good to wear under your layers
8425540 i have a bit of a kathryn wilson collection she just does fantastic shoes im not usually a heel person but there is something about the way she balances them that makes them really comfortable
8425541 im a bit of a denim tart you could say
8425542 i love denim and i love buying jeans ive got a bit of a collection maybe 10 pairs at the moment you can do anything with jeans wear them to formal events or slop around in them and i think denim is a bit like leather the way it ages and takes on the personality of the person wearing it
8425543 that is going to be big this summer like you are wearing your boyfriends jeans
8425544 i have already worn mine sitting low with a big belt and with a military style t shirt a hoodie and my chuck taylors so that look is a bit different to this floaty feminine style
8425545 i think christchurch women will be getting their gorgeous on
8425546 im very open to colour so i dont really have a favourite i do have to be careful with beige and some other neutrals like grey because they can wash me out
8425547 i have lots of denim and im getting more nice little dresses
8425548 ive got a beautiful sylvester dress in bright fuchsia a little mini dress with a bit of a bustier its quite a geometric look and its bright its very bright

8425561 its a battleground state everybody recognizes it and i believe that obama has an excellent chance to carry florida
8425562 i would say that the obama campaign would have to concentrate more on florida than the other southern states because florida is so key
8425563 its very inspiring and also kind of a message that i try to take home when i talk to my kids and my family and friends and i get to say oh i got to plant a tree with jimmy carter
8425564 its kind of the obama message that ordinary people working together can do extraordinary things
8425565 as far as were concerned the demolition application predates the landmarking process
8425566 i worked in a number of crum and forster buildings around the country
8425567 and that was the best one its beautiful i hope tech will save it
8425568 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8425569 over his 35 years in washington senator biden has been a reflexive liberal on every single economic issue
8425570 we want to eliminate the stigma thats attached to asking for help
8425571 if we dont deal with it now then we are going to end up in one way or another dealing with it later on
8425572 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8425573 over his 35 years in washington senator biden has been a reflexive liberal on every single economic issue

8425576 the content itself was not a problem what set the chinese government off was the concern over a potential protest in the olympic village apple was a target only to the extent that it was seen by the chinese authorities as aiding that protest
8425577 titan prisons would be a huge waste of public money doing nothing to reduce crime or tackle sky high reoffending rates
8425578 the money could be much better spent elsewhere making improvements to the existing prison system and investing in measures to reduce the prison population
8425579 cement this countrys position as the prison capital of western europe
8425580 as christians if we follow the example of christ in loving our neighbor as ourselves then we have to realize that everyone is our neighbor everyone deserves to be treated with love and respect and grace
8425581 i was determined to do what i knew in my heart was right i believe we are all children and to deny love to a fellow human is to reject the spark of g dliness that is in each of us
8425582 we wanted to tap in to the richest vein of popular british culture and theres nothing like rocknroll for that the bus was unmistakably london and when david beckham emerged that got the biggest cheer of the night from the chinese
8425583 it is one story in two halves an opportunity to remind the world what a rich vibrant eclectic diverse and influential culture we have
8425584 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was
8425585 even up to the time that i walked out onto the stage and they handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this so i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment but more importantly my role is different now
8425586 two specials in america with a u s setting and u s assistant will take it to another level
8425587 david tennant is already gaining a huge following and this will make him really hot property
8425588 the british pound is trading strong against the american dollar which means doing business including filming is much cheaper to do in the united states than it is in england
8425589 has the best track record of any contemporary movie actor none of todays media favorites clooney pitt depp damon can list so many films as good as transporter cellular transporter 2 london revolver crank war and death race
8425590 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist
8425591 get a glass from a cupboard in her kitchen and the whole piece of furniture fell off the wall on top of her cutting her temple and hitting her in the left eye
8425592 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation

8425598 seria uma pol tica semelhante a do glp ou do diesel semelhante a que tivemos em v rias crises do petr leo uma coisa tem que deixar clara esse subs dio tem que ser tempor rio sen o nunca as empresas ir o se adaptar ou voc vai ter uma economia que vai ter setor vivendo artificialmente vivendo s custas de um pre o irreal

8425604 eu senti uma boa receptividade inclusive dos l deres da oposi o
8425605 um l der da oposi o mencionou que talvez haja muitos poderes por parte do fundo uma abertura maior para poder fazer aplica es diversas concordamos que podemos delimitar mais o que o fundo poder fazer ele s poder fazer opera es de natureza financeira por exemplo n o poder comprar ou financiar diretamente empresa no exterior

8425623 eu passei anos colecionando v rias pe as e nunca imaginaria que poderia trazer o esp rito vintage de volta com tal qualidade e com um pre o que qualquer mulher pode pagar
8425624 here are the questions i dont want to be asked
8425625 its important to be aware that these projections are speculation based on previous behaviour
8425626 this population growth is absolutely unsustainable in environmental terms energy terms and food production it will make life for british citizens significantly worse even if we comprehensively greened our lifestyles the uk could only support 27 million people less than half its present population from its own resources
8425627 this is a fact of life which should be welcomed and embraced not treated with concern
8425628 have you recently been able to concentrate on what you are doing
8425629 have you been thinking of yourself as a worthless person
8425630 its a country pace rather than rushing about in the city the traffic problems are not so severe the countryside is magnificent and there are green fields everywhere just a short distance outside towns
8425631 of course weve all got our problems in the present economic crisis but people just go about their business and in these small towns theres a real feeling of community and also people are proud of their welshness which gives them a real sense of identity if you have that in a lovely landscape maybe thats why people are happy here
8425632 if they did 10 000 households for the whole of britain then how many did they do here
8425633 as far as i am concerned and many good people who live here relatives friends acquaintances people involved in the community and the economy we are happy to be within rhondda cynon taff yes we have had our difficulties but i firmly believe we are moving forward and have made good progress i believe that the outlook for rhondda cynon taff has certainly improved and is going to continue to improve
8425634 i would reject the idea that we are the unhappiest place in britain
8425635 theres a real sense of community in the south wales valleys how can you be unhappy when you have your friends around you
8425636 im a bit surprised i wouldnt say it was a bad place to live although maybe the living conditions could be improved when you compare the south wales valleys to cardiff which is only 25 miles away some of the facilities leave a lot to be desired
8425637 its wales people are pleasant and its just country living i suppose everyone seems happy and there are no city pressures
8425638 there really is something about the intrinsic nature of places which can influence happiness and wellbeing
8425639 the environment lack of green spaces air and noise pollution crime rates all of these influence happiness
8425640 the bridgewater loan is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world
8425641 the present initiative is intended to secure the long term future of the loan for the public benefit we are delighted to be working in close collaboration with the duke and our colleagues in london in order to achieve this
8425642 the governments proposals to build three titans each housing around 2 500 prisoners would cement this countrys position as the prison capital of western europe while squandering billions of pounds of taxpayers money which could be better spent elsewhere the proposals ignore evidence that smaller local prisons work better than large ones raise serious concerns about the wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff and would put at risk relationships between prisoners and their families
8425643 resources should be used to improve the prison system not expand it and legislation should be introduced to reduce the use of custody not increase it
8425644 titan prisons could exacerbate already high levels of mental distress if prisoners are kept further from their families in larger more impersonal establishments
8425645 i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what the police officer was telling me
8425646 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered and will be examined over the coming days
8425647 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing as soon as the house is deemed to be safe a search will be carried out to establish if anybody was inside forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8425648 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8425649 seemingly lastless dont mean you can ask us pushing down the relative bringing out your higher self
8425650 looking at gender issues in planning is central to success in economic regeneration social exclusion and regeneration cannot be addressed without taking gender issues into account because men and women experience poverty differently
8425651 councils simply wont recognise the findings a monumental amount of time and effort goes into making sure that new developments are places where people want to live and work and that they have the whole range of local facilities they need
8425652 theyre two of my biggest heroes it was a super honor
8425653 i started writing music in girls school im so grateful that my transition has been kind to me
8425654 amy and i started dating about four and a half years ago
8425655 i couldnt do very much for those two years we played around a little bit but my pitch kept changing all over the place
8425656 amy used to do burlesque and some cabaret stuff and her stage name was amazing grace and mine was coyote joe
8425657 it was definitely the biggest venue weve ever played in
8425658 i was a little starry eyed but they were very gracious we got to sing closer to fine with them and they said they really enjoyed it amy ray of the indigo girls watched almost the entire set from the wings that was very cool
8425659 we had a couple of friends of friends of people who know them who passed cds their way and they just heard about us enough there was a friend of mine who had taken them to an airport and played our cd and told them who i trans too and he gave them the background i think that just happened right when they needed someone to be on that bill and they asked us
8425660 on a wing and a prayer i drove all the way up there to do this song school
8425661 i just happened to take one of her classes and as soon as i played like half a song she asked me to go on tour with her she asked before she knew i was trans too which for some reason makes me feel better its super exciting
8425662 were learning to maneuver it as we go along but it has seemed to work really well shes the only person i can spend six months in a car with and not hate at the end of it
8425663 even when you try to write something thats not about you it ends up being about you
8425664 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago
8425665 two out of every three animals in the pictures were oriented in a direction roughly pointing to magnetic north the resolution of the images was not sufficient to tell which ends of the cows were pointing north however
8425666 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk
8425667 i can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by may 2009
8425668 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8425669 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8425670 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf
8425671 the new capital will allow us to accelerate production expansion for our 430 megawatt san jose factory and our 620 megawatt berlin factory
8425672 ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
8425673 right of parents to have the aid of the government in protecting children
8425674 weve seen similar proposals in the past that havent gone very far and this proposal seems quite similar to that older proposal except presented by a law professor in a law review rather than a local business man
8425675 right of parents to have the aid of the government in protecting children
8425676 my parents always taught me to put others before myself
8425677 what specialist roy did was really remarkable and shows how much of a good guy he really is
8425678 soldiers usually take deployment money and spend it on themselves i was surprised by how much money came out of his pocket
8425679 i figured if people saw me giving back it would encourage them to do the same
8425680 when they see a soldier trying to give back when they are already selflessly serving their country they want to be a part of it as well
8425681 to know that you can make a profound difference in someones life is a wonderful feeling
8425682 i got a letter of thanks from the first child and her mother that i sponsored through make a wish and she said she was moved to tears by my kindness theres no feeling like that its hard to put in words how that made me feel
8425683 shes always shared a bedroom and her older sister just moved out so were making her a place she can call her own
8425684 an educational experience for them they are learning about iraq and what the soldiers are doing here to make things better
8425685 i spent the day with them answering questions and playing at recesses
8425686 it was a great experience it only takes a few minutes every couple of weeks to write a small letter to let them know how things are going they looked at me with such awe i was really touched to be a part of their lives
8425687 there were bullet holes everywhere and i saw a lot of burned down houses

8425691 instead of rushing headlong into an expensive prison building programme the government must focus on addressing the causes of the growing prison population
8425692 building bigger prisons will achieve nothing clearly the government are looking to build titan prisons based on a need to save money
8425693 titan prison complexes will be the most effective way of providing value for money and reducing reoffending

8425698 fashion is obsessed with finding young beautiful and vulnerable girls bringing them into the fashion world praising them worshipping them but suddenly dropping them like a stone when they hit puberty and grow boobs and hips its so dangerous and can potentially harm the girls mentally and physically

8425700 one should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth
8425701 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8425702 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8425703 over the last 60 years the number of people who are severely overweight has risen steadily and there is a very real danger that todays children will not live longer than their parents
8425704 as part of the strategy this autumn we will be launching a national movement that will bring about a fundamental change in the way we live our lives

8425710 looking at gender issues in planning is central to success in economic regeneration social exclusion and regeneration cannot be addressed without taking gender issues into account because men and women experience poverty differently
8425711 councils simply wont recognise the findings a monumental amount of time and effort goes into making sure that new developments are places where people want to live and work and that they have the whole range of local facilities they need
8425712 consumers just simply couldnt tell a good distributor from a bad one
8425713 a vast amount of products is available but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards
8425714 we will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health
8425715 one product we found called original herbal ecstasy contained nutmeg which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants
8425716 yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications they could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis
8425717 there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated websites
8425718 there is no guarantee of safety quality or effectiveness it could be counterfeit or out of date it may not contain the right amount of medicine there is no ongoing treatment monitoring at worst it may cause severe side effects its not worth it
8425719 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects

8425754 it is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world and is of supreme importance to scotland and the rest of the uk
8425755 they could be one of the greatest acquisitions we could ever make these are among the four or five pictures which would come to mind if one thought of what titian stood for as an artist
8425756 it is really important to realise that art is not there just for the country in its moments of affluence it is a major solace for times of difficulty most major acquisitions have been made against a background of economic distress

8425775 we believe in allah and the revelation given to us and to abraham ismail isaac jacob and the tribes and that given to moses and jesus and that given to all prophets from their lord we make no difference between one and another of them and we bow to allah in islam
8425776 it follows i think that not only is there no conflict between genetics and religion but in fact religion can guide science by adding revelation to some traditional scientific approaches that there exists statements in the quran shown by science to be valid which supports knowledge in the quran having been derived from allah
8425777 islam is the fastest growing religion in the united states

8425802 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8425803 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8425804 i felt like absolute shit as a teenager when i was modelling and all i had around me was people telling me i was right
8425805 pulling him and pushing him keep doing it telling people this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it

8425808 the presence of these squatters is delaying comprehensive refurbishment work to bring these properties up to the standard our troops and their families deserve
8425809 we just thought they were empty council flats going to be demolished had we known the mod were going to refurbish them we probably wouldnt have moved in
8425810 every night when i go to bed all i can hear is boom boom boom from their music its driving me crackers
8425811 we have complained so many times about the noise but we kept being told nothing could be done about it
8425812 there are people here from all over the world italians spaniards south africans portuguese
8425813 once we had a massive banquet for over 100 people and it was all free
8425814 i am not opposed to paying rent if someone was to look at how much i earned and work out a sensible amount to take for rent id be more than happy to pay

8425818 eighty percent of the kids we bring over get placed
8425819 weve had 150 kids adopted over the years and 30 more adoptions are in the works
8425820 we help them have a good time without making any promises
8425821 i was a silicon valley sales guy for 21 years i got laid off in 2002 and a week later i was invited to speak at an adoption conference and help lead a bay area hosting program
8425822 our mission is to create an opportunity for kids to meet families we get the word out through churches the media and our network
8425823 in the past we had pursued adoption through santa clara county
8425824 it was very hard to get our foot in the door
8425825 we dont really miss russia because we like this place better
8425826 we like all the fun stuff and all the toys we have
8425827 we get doctor care and we get to go to church and we can get a good education
8425828 they didnt speak any english so we had to deal with translators
8425829 there was a fear of being sent back to the orphanage
8425830 and they would hoard food they would run out of food at the orphanage they didnt understand that you dont run out of food in america

8425833 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8425834 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8425835 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8425836 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months
8425837 software for internet cafes computer gaming clubs hotels hostels libraries

8425839 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8425841 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation

8425850 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
8425851 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8425852 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8425853 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairydust feel of the obama revolution
8425854 i couldnt understand why he would organise a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president
8425855 the presence of these squatters is delaying comprehensive refurbishment work to bring these properties up to the standard our troops and their families deserve
8425856 we just thought they were empty council flats going to be demolished had we known the mod were going to refurbish them we probably wouldnt have moved in

8425862 we have done all we can to help the property owners to remove squatters from limerick court as quickly as possible
8425863 even though they are aware of these tragedies these people who are desperate continue trying to make the journey to europe
8425864 it makes no sense to regularly target command and control nodes with precision guided munitions while denying highly capable sniper teams the ability to attack individual targets
8425865 little more than a semi secret version of the state department relying on dinners with host country intelligence services passing out specialized equipment and rewarding favorites with free trips to the united states
8425866 the messy business of back alley tradecraft has taken a back seat to the much simpler business of liaison with foreign intelligence services
8425867 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
8425868 it was inspired by a lobbying committee designed to sway us public and political opinion in favor of expanding the nato alliance
8425869 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a
8425870 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
8425871 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup de tat in brussels
8425872 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major us action outside north america
8425873 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus the only natos military decisions require consensus
8425874 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
8425875 the state of the economy is very worrying and i dont think people have properly factored in how bad things really are
8425876 for now we expect a modest contraction of about 0
8425877 all this supports our view that interest rates will eventually fall much further than the markets currently expect for now we are sticking to our prediction that rates will drop to 3 5 next year but we think it is quite plausible that they fall even further
8425878 another day brings another gloomy prediction the brown bubble has burst and thanks to labours incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8425879 the rest of the world needs to know that apart from press coverage in the west the gay issue is not a pre occupation of the poor
8425880 and we dont want it imposed on us as a priority agenda our agenda is about basic survival food for the hungry and we cannot focus on other agendas in the words of a swahili proverb an empty stomach has no ears to hear with
8425881 i can only pray that the media will be as passionate in reporting on these issues as they are on the homosexual debate
8425882 morality means justice compassion and the defence of the needy it means humility realism and questioning repentance and generosity thats quite a lot to be going on with
8425883 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture
8425884 contrary to popular belief it is no longer the aocs highest quality wines that are responsible for the bitter aftertaste of our exports
8425885 regional wines which were really driving our exports have now broken down
8425886 the biggest difficulties were encountered in the anglo saxon markets which tend to like regional wines
8425887 the current problems with the exchange rate have affected these markets in particular and with them these wines from an extremely competitive niche
8425888 the state of the economy is very worrying and i dont think people have properly factored in how bad things really are
8425889 for now we expect a modest contraction of about 0
8425890 all this supports our view that interest rates will eventually fall much further than the markets currently expect for now we are sticking to our prediction that rates will drop to 3 5 next year but we think it is quite plausible that they fall even further
8425891 another day brings another gloomy prediction the brown bubble has burst and thanks to labours incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8425892 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people we have significantly disrupted an organised crime group that had been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks
8425893 he was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up
8425894 you are talking about blood money this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money he is selling the guns to the underworld just to kill people and its all because of greed
8425895 i think he the gun maker is as guilty as the people who are using the gun
8425896 it is clear that the usage in crimes in the uk of mac 10s can be directly linked to the factory at the briars
8425897 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets
8425898 their experience in financial services will be of great benefit to rbs given the increasingly diversified and international nature of our powerful banking franchises
8425899 they are no shrinking violets they will stand up to the board
8425900 its one step forward in corporate governance but they have more to do
8425901 he is very ambitious and knows exactly how many beans make four when it comes to banking
8425902 hester is a bit young to be chairman and british land are unlikely to let him go to be chief executive
8425903 from an rbs point of view hes a nice answer to the people who question succession planning
8425904 this move by rbs is too little too late but a step in the right direction for upgrading the board and providing credibility for the long overdue ceo search ryan and mcfarlane know their banking
8425905 the individuals we work with from the collective action of the state
8425906 in a country where my government the system i am employed by initiates sponsors and promotes genocide against my people
8425907 mass starvation amounting to genocide in the palestinian occupied territories
8425908 it saddens me and leaves a vague bitter taste of defeat and guilt
8425909 under normal circumstances would be grounds for bringing charges of sexual molestation because the touching was quite uninhibited and the stroking extensive and repetitive
8425910 blood and religion the unmasking of the jewish and democratic state
8425911 overwhelmingly indicate that israel is anything but democratic and tends in the opposite direction as a racist genocidal and apartheid state
8425912 can prove my belonging to this piece of the earths crust that i inherited from my father who inherited it from his father who
8425913 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8425914 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8425915 if we leave before this government resigns that means we are defeated
8425916 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8425917 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8425918 over the last 60 years the number of people who are severely overweight has risen steadily and there is a very real danger that todays children will not live longer than their parents
8425919 as part of the strategy this autumn we will be launching a national movement that will bring about a fundamental change in the way we live our lives
8425920 the change4life movement will not hector or point the finger it will give everyone wherever they live the information and support they need to eat more healthily and be more active
8425921 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it

8425923 they spoke the unspeakable wrote the unthinkable and lived their lives as few before them ever had open and proud lesbians in 1950s america
8425924 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8425925 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8425926 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed

8425930 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8425931 in the end though it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8425932 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8425933 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8425934 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8425935 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8425936 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8425937 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8425938 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8425939 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change

8425941 she seems good and is acting normal which for her is being in laid back mode
8425942 actually shes laid back every day and doesnt get too over enthused about anything
8425943 usually we stable at a farm but most of them have been full up here this summer weve got a friend with a farm with paddocks close by so we give her a lot of paddock time shes really out more than shes in
8425944 we might train her light a very slow mile to get her muscles warm but usually we dont train her when shes racing every week
8425945 shes very laid back and once she gets under the lights shes all business

8425950 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk

8425953 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic

8425956 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8425957 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8425958 it is very very weird we have not heard anything we dont know whether they were in there or not
8425959 nobody knows until we can get access to the building
8425960 i just feel at this early stage that baileys dreams maturity and manners tip the scales slightly in his favour monkey king at best is probably a 50 50 chance to go away from a stand
8425961 but i just think he can get wound up and a little uptight on big heat occasions the key to his chance will be how quickly he can hit his straps properly if he tangles away
8425962 he is so competitive its not as if he is a rat bag manner wise but he just wants to get on with it
8425963 he drew four on the back row last year and never got into the race reid pointed out

8425970 one hundred percent of children are touched by bullying as a victim perpetrator or bystander
8425971 in a recent study 77 percent of students said they have been bullied and 14 percent of those who have been bullied said they have experienced severe reactions to the abuse
8425972 bullying is a reality that must be recognized and addressed it is not simply a part of growing up
8425973 although there is a tendency to categorize we must realize that students may be a victim in a given circumstance and a bully in another
8425974 sometimes when a bullied student is otherwise unable to stop the bullying the victim may in turn exhibit those behaviors to others
8425975 we should not tell students to fight back against bullies the cycle of bullying and victimization is reinforced when the victim responds aggressively mediation between the bully and victim is not possible in a true case of bullying putting them together to work out their problems would simply revictimize the victim
8425976 the popular kids are very likely to use their popularity in a negative way they will use their status within the group to humiliate others and because they tend to be psychologically stronger than their peers they use that ability to control others bullies can enjoy a high social status
8425977 the evidence is clear that bullies when allowed to continue will escalate their behavior as they get older vandalism shoplifting and truancy are all destructive aggressive behaviors theres also a direct correlation between substance abuse and gun violence and bullying behavior
8425978 this is one of the most difficult myths about bullying to overcome
8425979 research indicates that self esteem seems to be an indicator of intensified prosocial and antisocial tendencies high self esteem can mean that a student can be either a positive or negative leader in other words we cannot assume that a student who thinks well of him or herself is not a bully because he or she can use that self confidence either to bully or defend victims
8425980 elementary school children who witness bullying are at risk for long term troublesome and depressive behaviors
8425981 it causes stress anxiety apprehension and other types of physical responses in children

8425985 it is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world and is of supreme importance to scotland and the rest of the uk
8425986 they could be one of the greatest acquisitions we could ever make these are among the four or five pictures which would come to mind if one thought of what titian stood for as an artist
8425987 it is really important to realise that art is not there just for the country in its moments of affluence it is a major solace for times of difficulty most major acquisitions have been made against a background of economic distress
8425988 obviously his strongly preferred option is to sell them to the national galleries the price represents a huge discount i know the duke is extremely fond of these paintings they mean a lot to him
8425989 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8425990 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8425991 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8425992 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans

8426000 are all the problems necessarily the fault of apple or the iphone
8426001 your iphone is out of warranty so you cannot get hardware support just technical support
8426002 im so sorry apple really regrets this happening to users
8426003 you are telling me that my hardware problem started at exactly the same time as the upgrade to 2 0
8426004 well i know it sounds crazy but yes your hardware has gone bad and it just happened to go bad at the same time as the update
8426005 its not supported and you would void any warranty you have
8426006 the years of the major makers shipping out 75 in hardware and selling it for 600 are over
8426007 oh gee there are problems must be the network because in the lab it works fine
8426008 apples coterie is reminiscent of the french jacobin club and its morbid obsession with power death and adversarialism
8426009 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies a president who has the judgment to use war as a last resort not a first resort
8426010 the time has come for a president who has lived the american dream who is on our side a president who will cut our dependence on foreign oil and lead us into the new energy frontier a president who will make us stronger and safer as americans
8426011 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country we support enthusiastically his plans to restore the american dream for american families and we stand united proudly in our determination to elect barack obama
8426012 ladies and gentlemen this the cause for which we stand an american president named barack obama who will lead and inspire the free world an american president named barack obama who will stand for the rule of law who will remember that torture is the way of the people who hate us and not our way
8426013 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8426014 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8426015 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8426016 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8426017 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8426018 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8426019 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8426020 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8426021 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8426022 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8426023 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8426024 this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest

8426033 contrary to popular belief it is no longer the aocs highest quality wines that are responsible for the bitter aftertaste of our exports
8426034 regional wines which were really driving our exports have now broken down
8426035 the biggest difficulties were encountered in the anglo saxon markets which tend to like regional wines
8426036 the current problems with the exchange rate have affected these markets in particular and with them these wines from an extremely competitive niche
8426037 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8426038 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8426039 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8426040 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8426041 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8426062 it cuts down on our lunch because we only get 30 minutes for our lunch and it cuts down on how much time we get to eat

8426080 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8426081 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war

8426092 the analysis by the times found that obama donors gave 300 000 to mrs clinton in july and 135 000 in june

8426094 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8426095 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8426096 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen

8426103 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8426104 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8426105 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8426106 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8426107 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8426108 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country

8426136 some parents whose children have gender identity issues are already angry about the fact that few professionals have been invited from abroad
8426137 the dutch data on gender suspension looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up

8426142 contrary to popular belief it is no longer the aocs highest quality wines that are responsible for the bitter aftertaste of our exports
8426143 regional wines which were really driving our exports have now broken down
8426144 the biggest difficulties were encountered in the anglo saxon markets which tend to like regional wines
8426145 the current problems with the exchange rate have affected these markets in particular and with them these wines from an extremely competitive niche
8426146 sometimes i wish i were a little kid again skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts
8426147 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8426148 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8426149 there are id procedures that need to take place and they could all be jeopardised if his name or description is released at this stage
8426150 i guess i could grind through all the free information and figure it out on my own but it would probably be months before i get the process down and then months more before it starts giving me income if these guys want to teach me the process so i can avoid the trial and error answer all my questions along the way and surround me with people who have already been successful why wouldnt i do that
8426151 one of the friends i met hannah nayoge is a beautiful young woman who is working on a public health degree in kampala after a long few days of deconstructing old theologies hannah and i had a conversation in which she told me she was tired tired of it all tired of a world hurting and a church content to turn its back and make lofty pronunciations on the eternal fate of outsiders tired of performing the mental gymnastics of truly wrestling with what it means to follow jesus but she said smiling hopefully at me something new is coming i feel it
8426152 nice story darren but where are you going with it
8426153 im weak and biased and the worst of all sinners
8426154 is that once you have understood something analyzed and critiqued it you have changed it but academic libraries are full of brilliant analyses of every facet of human culture that have made no difference at all in the world beyond the stacks
8426155 this is the first time asacp has held a press conference in washington and it provided a very unique opportunity to share what the adult entertainment industry is doing to protect children
8426156 we are thrilled to be able to share with our members and supporters who make our work possible footage from this press conference
8426157 we are so grateful to stormy daniels for her tireless efforts in support of rta and to roy karch and dave boccuzzi for donating their time and expertise to create the video of the press conference
8426158 we will review how the relaxation hours go and accordingly take a decision for thursday
8426159 significantly stronger performance for a year when the international economy was challenging and we have had to face a considerable increase in costs driven by a higher oil price
8426160 this result reflects improved productivity after significant restructuring with new capacity in europe and the closure of loss making plants in brazil and the uk
8426161 demand increased in asia and there was a positive contribution from the successful g cure acquisition in the us
8426162 we also expect positive contributions from group efficiency programs to increase capacity and lower costs and from expansion of composites resin capacity in australia to bring in house product currently manufactured by a third party materially lowering operating costs
8426163 new agencies have broadened both nuplexs product offering and target market and several significant development projects are nearing completion
8426164 nonetheless we are confident that the investment nuplex has made in people plant and technology will provide the platform for continuing organic and acquisitive growth
8426165 a return to full pre flood production levels at coppabella is not expected until january 2009
8426166 its breaking my heart to watch you run around cause i know that youre living a lie

8426169 these are the earliest copies of the bible ever found
8426170 the bible is sacred to us and to you and to all the monotheistic religions and therefore the scrolls are national treasures and world treasures and therefore it is our duty to preserve them at least for 2 000 years more
8426171 just by applying the latest infrared technologies and shooting at very high detail lots of resolution we are already opening up new characters from the scrolls that are either extremely indistinct or you just couldnt see them before
8426172 to switch over to digital is really the way to go and people were resistant to it initially because it was a new way of doing stuff
8426173 you can see where the ink has broken away and you can see the texture of the animal skin so you can see more detail than you can see with the naked eye
8426174 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling i will make that contrast very clearly
8426175 in terms of his speech obama has got to do two things he has to rally his base and he has to reach out to independent voters
8426176 to get people focused on the economy because that is the area of his strength but he also has to reassure people in the areas where they are not as confident of him
8426177 this democratic convention has a vibe so weird and jittery so at odds with the early thrilling fairydust feel of the obama revolution
8426178 i couldnt understand why he would organise a convention to give the clintons two nights and then diss hillary as vice president
8426179 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk
8426180 i can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by may 2009
8426181 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8426182 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8426183 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf

8426190 contrary to recent media reports metro goldwyn mayer studios inc is not for sale there is no asking price for the company
8426191 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot
8426192 he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics and when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
8426193 the city of baghdad has a depth of history and a cultural legacy that can be a basis for attracting and fostering tourism
8426194 oh i feel so comforted by the fact that youre independent
8426195 i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards
8426196 the aim is that you can go online and call up the scrolls with the best possible resolution and all the information that exists about them today
8426197 within the worlds emerging economies millions of new businesses are demanding just the technology they need at the prices they can afford from a vendor they can trust today we answer that need by introducing new products that join our existing vostro product line
8426198 together with our partners dell will play an important role in bringing more technology to more people than ever before whether in business or in the public sector vostro is a key building block to unleashing the potential of the connected era

8426200 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8426201 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny

8426204 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all i remember standing up in the bath one day and i was so thin i was never anorexic i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8426205 i remember i came back from a job in paris and the stylist said to me have you been eating too many croissants karen
8426206 fashion is obsessed with finding young beautiful and vulnerable girls bringing them into the fashion world praising them worshipping them but suddenly dropping them like a stone when they hit puberty and grow boobs and hips its so dangerous and can potentially harm the girls mentally and physically
8426207 the modelling industry has united against the certificates we therefore call on model agents to find a workable solution or an alternative and set best practice for the modelling industry
8426208 we found that the software we used was designed for somebody else

8426214 and im also a bit superstitious i never claim it out loud we just do the work i dont want to jinx it
8426215 i dont want too get to far ahead of myself because i think just from a sanity perspective its always better to be in the moment to figure out what we have to do today tomorrow and the next couple of days
8426216 so i try not to get too far ahead of myself and that may lead me to be more of the kind of person that if this is something that was meant to be it will be
8426217 to sit back and say i cant believe this is happening i cant believe were doing this the anchor asks the candidates wife in excerpts provided by

8426220 arbitrary arrests tortured detainees clamping down of freedom of expression and assembly
8426221 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the internet freedom of net neutrality
8426222 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
8426223 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
8426224 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
8426225 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
8426226 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
8426227 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
8426228 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
8426229 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
8426230 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do
8426231 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats

8426238 ill find a recipe that looks good and veganize it
8426239 it just so happens that the produce from local farms really starts to come in on the fourth of july
8426240 zucchinis are what most commonly come to mind where you can cut them and grill them into what are called steaks
8426241 they know where the food is grown can ask questions and visit the farms
8426242 on the news it said grocery food goes 1 500 miles
8426243 i like the idea of food thats fresh and close and i like supporting the people who are growing
8426244 whether the food is organic isnt an issue but i think shipping concerns are important
8426245 ill explore new recipes and am open to different flavors
8426246 grilling and just going to barbecues can be kind of difficult especially with new people who dont know you are a vegetarian
8426247 if someone else is nice enough to grill it for me im not too picky
8426248 last year we cooked every night in the hatch residence hall basement for basically anyone who wanted to eat it
8426249 thats when i really got into cooking because the vegetarians began really relying on us for food
8426250 ive always loved cooking i had always just been horrible at it
8426251 but once i became a vegan it was like i had to start cooking my own food and i started looking into a lot of vegetarian and vegan cookbooks and learning about spicing and how to make things taste good
8426252 im always around food but im never the one making it im usually the one eating it
8426253 you have to learn how to see if the dish tastes good on its own or not not just if it tastes like a meat dish you are used to
8426254 there is nothing harder about making a vegan dish taste good than making a meat dish taste good
8426255 its just like learning to cook again but in a different way

8426261 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8426262 hillary has set the table it is time for obama to serve the meal
8426263 are you just talking about having a baby or expecting
8426264 well i had two children and i would never consider an epidural you couldnt pay me

8426271 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8426272 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8426273 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8426274 market conditions in general are not expected to improve over the balance of the year
8426275 at the same time we have suffered from operator reluctance to purchase product ahead of the availability of our new viridian cabinet and gen7 platform and a larger library of content
8426276 the combined impact of smoking bans increased taxes and the economic effects of higher interest rates and petrol prices on venue gaming turnover resulted in a significant decline in platform sales 40 5 per cent representing an unsustainable implied 40 year replacement cycle

8426282 okay ill admit like stephen king i hate this question
8426283 i signed up for a craft show and forgot about it for a year when i was reminded that i had a table paid for and that the show was in two weeks i decided to make jewelry my first creations were really pathetic but i did have some sales and i was hooked i loved making jewelry i loved working the shows and talking to people and i loved making money to buy more jewelry making supplies its a vicious circle a black hole and i couldnt be happier
8426284 today im proud of each and every piece of work i put up for sale or create for a commissioned request while i love to give my work new homes it sometimes feels like one of my kids are leaving the nest when i sell a favorite piece
8426285 lets declare right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8426286 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules all votes cast by the delegates will be counted
8426287 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be nominated by acclamation as the nominee
8426288 there are two objectives with this ordinance 1 reduce or even eliminate the amount of unwanted flyers business cards and the like that are left on our porches 2
8426289 we are combining it sales tax hike with an economic stimulus package so therefore it will not have any impact at all because i think the idea is to have an economic stimulus package that stimulates the economy then to have a temporary sales tax increase that then becomes actually a decrease and in the long run it will actually be an overall decrease of sales tax
8426290 is completely false our camp never approached the obama camp the obama and clinton camps were calling our office before the puerto rican primary trying to get yankee to endorse them the mccain camp approached us as well
8426291 yankee considered all the proposals and he liked mccains thats why he decided to endorse him
8426292 we find it hard to believe that obamas people would want to be associated with daddy yankee
8426293 this is a rapidly growing and important customer sector for fincad in the last year alone we have sold analytics software and support to nearly 100 hedge funds
8426294 clearly market conditions combined with investor demands for pricing transparency and consolidated risk assessment are all driving a growing need for comprehensive easy to use analytic solutions
8426295 this a great opportunity for anyone in the derivatives industry to not only preview what our software has to offer but also see what fincad professional services has to offer
8426296 so how do i share my faith with someone who doesnt share the same beliefs
8426297 ive tried buddhism and thats pretty interesting and i spoke with a jehovahs witness once and that sounded good too i think that there are many paths that lead to god theres no one way
8426298 theres a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof is the way of death
8426299 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me
8426300 we look forward to benefiting from randys wealth of experience and creative ideas in marketing and advertising
8426301 randy brings to us an impressive track record of positive results in marketing and advertising and he has been an outstanding community leader in lubbock we are pleased to have him as a key member of our senior management team
8426302 democrats saw the south as unwinnable and republicans viewed the south as a base

8426304 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
8426305 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8426306 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8426307 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8426308 from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8426309 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8426310 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
8426311 our colleagues at the glass bead collective a group of video artists and documentarians are in the twin cities to prepare for the republican national convention they were swarmed by three police cars detained and had all of their electronic gear including laptop computers videocameras and personal items were taken from them by minneapolis police no one was arrested the stop and seizure was explained by police officers as related to homeland security and the republican convention
8426312 im marching because of the treatment hillary received during the primaries she was treated so unfairly by the media and the dnc and no one stood up to say anything about it until after theyd asked her to leave and that was ridiculous the media totally geared and led this campaign obama wasnt elected he was selected
8426313 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and bold endeavor
8426314 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there
8426315 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama to the presidency of the united states
8426316 when even former alberta premier peter lougheed who started the tar sands ball rolling is calling for change you know this is a major disaster
8426317 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on of terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
8426318 getting devean back in a mavs uniform has been a goal of ours all summer
8426319 his experience and ability to run the floor and play and defend multiple positions will be a great asset for us this season
8426320 you want to drive people to the internet and give them more information on the internet and then bring them back to the network
8426321 i think it shows that viewers want to be able to access content where and when they want it and that wont hurt television numbers
8426322 i think the 2008 summer olympics is certainly the first games in canada anyhow that we were able to really take advantage of mobile television
8426323 its also the type of event thats perfect for this platform it goes on all day and you may have a particular sport that you follow and you can pop in and get what you need and pull back out again its great to have this on demand or a live broadcast streaming this kind of content
8426324 i think we were able to take the olympic viewing out of your home and you could take it with you
8426325 the evidence is mostly indicative of what your canadian broadcasting company found is that it does help rather cannibalize the tv audience
8426326 i dont think the technology is ready i dont think consumers are aware of it either
8426327 from what weve seen were pleased to see the consumer enthusiasm for mobile olympic coverage
8426328 while amp will prudently manage through these market conditions we will also continue to invest where we see potential growth opportunities that position us well over the medium to long term
8426329 m amp a can be legitimate but it would have to be strategically relevant
8426330 businesses that are most impacted by the share market have also held up
8426331 that demonstrates financial strength and the strength of our business model
8426332 we expect margins to contract by two to three per cent per annum over the longer term because of the competitive market in which we operate
8426333 notwithstanding the short term pressures caused by markets our goal remains to deliver top quartile tsr performance over a five year cycle which means average annual growth of 15 per cent in the value of an investment in amp
8426334 our capital strategy is aimed at enhancing this already strong position in the current climate increasing business flexibility to grow and further optimising our capital mix
8426335 in difficult market conditions like these we have a bias towards holding more capital rather than less
8426336 amp has demonstrated a disciplined approach to capital management in recent years and will continue to be responsive to changing market conditions
8426337 with market conditions likely to remain volatile for the rest of this year delivering growth in the short term will continue to be challenging but we remain confident in the medium to long term outlook for the wealth management industry
8426338 do you know of any other bars restaurants or shops which will be mia this labor day weekend
8426339 los efectos econ micos de la esclavitud siguen pesando sobre la vida del pueblo africano
8426340 los ataques hacia frica por europa transformaron tanto a frica como a europa
8426341 entonces el progreso de todas las fuerzas sociales din micas europeas fue logrado sobre un pedestal de opresi n africana
8426342 las riquezas robadas de nuestra madre frica por la burgues a europea socav la autoridad y la l gica de la aristocracia europea terrateniente resultando en revoluciones democr ticas por toda europa y en estados unidos de norteam rica
8426343 estas riquezas robadas tambi n dieron como resultado la revoluci n industrial que fue el mpetu por el fin de la esclavitud y el inicio del colonialismo directo lo cual facilit la expropiaci n de materia prima de frica y otros lugares
8426344 un n mero inconcebible de africanos algunos calculan alrededor de 200 millones fueron secuestrados de frica priv ndole a sta de campesinos cient ficos curanderos artesanos educadores l deres pol ticos y religiosos poetas fil sofos m sicos todos los elementos humanos necesarios para el progreso social y el desarrollo econ mico

8426348 el neocolonialismo es el poder blanco en un rostro negro
8426349 el significado del neocolonialismo est en su habilidad de ocultar la mano explotadora del poder blanco y asignar las responsabilidades por la miseria creciente de las masas africanas a sus aliados pero subordinados t teres negros
8426350 econ micamente el neocolonialismo previene el desarrollo de una econom a nacional africana algo sumamente necesario al encerrar toda la vida econ mica de nuestra gente dentro de fronteras impuestas por el colonialismo dichas fronteras fueron creadas expl citamente para la transferencia de nuestras riquezas a europa norteam rica y ahora con m s frecuencia a jap n econ micamente hablando el neocolonialismo restringe el desarrollo necesario para una econom a africana nacional al encerrar el porvenir econ mico de nuestro pueblo dentro de las fronteras coloniales mismas que fueron creadas con el s lo prop sito de facilitar la transferencia de los recursos de frica a europa am rica del norte y cada vez m s a jap n el neocolonialismo impide que frica elabore una estrategia ordenada de comercio dejando as a europa y a am rica del norte con la plena libertad de imponer tarifas de exportaci n e importaci n esto no es nada m s que las condiciones necesarias para que europa y am rica del norte contin en con el despojo de las riquezas africanas el neocolonialismo contribuye a la crisis econ mica que frica enfrenta en la actualidad tan s lo el siete por ciento del comercio formal de frica se desempe a al interior del mismo continente lo que significa que el 93 por ciento del comercio africano es sencillamente una continuidad del despojo de los recursos africanos por nuestros opresores y explotadores hist ricos adicionalmente el 83 por ciento del producto interno bruto combinado de las naciones africanas va destinado a pagar las deudas que los gobernantes neo colonialistas han acumulado esto significa que frica tiene tan s lo acceso a un 17 por ciento de sus propios recursos despu s de pagar las deudas acumuladas despu s de que la primitiva peque a burgues a neo colonial toma su parte las masas africanas se tienen que conformar con s lo el cinco por ciento de lo que han producido

8426367 i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and its going to stay that way i am very satisfied with what god gave me
8426368 i do the best i can to keep myself fit both in body and mind i also draw a lot of strength and energy from yoga new age and cosmic energies i very much believe in karma the way you treat your fellow man is how you will ultimately be treated yourself
8426369 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8426370 shes going to be a little more different and more from the industry standpoint
8426371 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate
8426372 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8426373 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8426374 the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford
8426375 it was an honour to receive this last year and it remains an honour to accept this this year
8426376 we will see 21 films and i hope and i have a lot of confidence in marco that we will see 21 films that will give us the state of art of what is cinema today
8426377 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8426378 its a tremendous loss for the college but beyond that we just dont have a lot of information
8426379 although inspired by the contents is not a representation of mr mcgartlands life
8426380 he was also given the opportunity to have the name of the lead character replaced with a fictional character name which he declined
8426381 i should not have been placed in that position i was never in such a position
8426382 i cannot understand why they had to change things to that extent
8426383 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8426384 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8426385 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8426386 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8426387 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8426388 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8426389 were presenting five dramatic first features from the region which is almost unheard of
8426390 i dont think weve ever had a year with that many first features were kind of highlighting that
8426391 the festival has nurtured and humoured me as a filmmaker for about 10 years
8426392 the festival is that thing that you aim for its the most immediate thing that you have to know theres a good possibility your work is going to be shown
8426393 because my film is such a low budget the tax credits for sure play a major role
8426394 local filmmakers make up about 50 to 60 per cent of the projects in the province from year to year
8426395 the community has grown theres lots of film schools here and these are also people whove also had long term writing and directing shorts careers
8426396 theyre finally taking the next step with the support of government bodies and weve always screened their work and supported them all the way along so when you get all of these factors built in eventually people will take the next step and were here to celebrate it
8426397 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8426398 los estudiantes no tendremos que pagar ni un centavo en la universidad ni por pensiones ni por matr culas
8426399 hemos salido a las calles y hemos trascrito esas palabras de esa constituci n que nos representa
8426400 existen en las estad sticas que indican que de cada diez bachilleres s lo uno ingresa a la universidad
8426401 porque la constituci n dice que la educaci n no s lo es responsabilidad del estado sino tambi n de la familia y de la sociedad pero en la actual constituci n habla que la educaci n es responsabilidad nica e inalienable del estado ecuatoriano
8426402 aquellas que est n con autogesti n tambi n van a tener recursos y en ese sentido la universidad contar con el recurso suficiente
8426403 nosotros como mpd estamos en una intensa campa a por el s creemos que el proceso constitucional es la culminaci n de d cadas de lucha del movimiento se est n recogiendo en la nueva constituci n pr cticamente las banderas del movimiento estudiantil de los trabajadores y hoy estamos a punto de tener una constituci n que recupera derechos soberan a y desde ese punto de vista somos parte y protagonistas de ese cambio
8426404 somos optimistas estamos recorriendo el pa s y entendemos que el pueblo ecuatoriano en el ltimo proceso ha ido encontrando un anhelo de cambio que se va clarificando este pueblo es bien especial en esos a os de democracia representativa ning n presidente ha podido repetirse ning n partido ha sido la mayor fuerza pol tica en una elecci n el pueblo siempre ha estado buscando el cambio
8426405 cuando a la gente le decimos que el neoliberalismo durante 30 a os hizo que la educaci n sea excluyente la universidad sea pagada m s de 8 mil escuelas cerradas la gente ve el ayer y ahora le decimos que se va a duplicar el presupuesto de educaci n si le decimos que la universidad va a ser gratuita y que tendr n acceso los hijos del pueblo son razones que la gente entiende directamente
8426406 j venes maestros campesinos trabajadores informales que han sido en el pasado perseguidos son sectores que quieren el cambio tradicionalmente el pueblo ecuatoriano no quiere que regrese el pasado y quiz s esa es la mayor fortaleza del s plantearnos que en la nueva constituci n haya un futuro
8426407 este pa s est polarizado hace rato es uno de los pa ses mas injustos de am rica latina cuando hay una mayor a que est fuera de la riqueza que no tiene acceso a educaci n salud a trabajo y una minor a que vive del trabajo ajeno que se hace millonaria a costa de la riqueza nacional evidentemente hay una polarizaci n ahora lo que ocurre es que esa mayor a est tomando conciencia de cambiar las cosas
8426408 estar a preocupado si las c maras estuvieran aplaudiendo la constituci n
8426409 estar a preocupado si el partido de jamil maguad la udc estuviera apoyando la constituci n pero me alegra mucho que estos sectores que han estado acostumbrados a no pagar impuestos a tercerizar a los trabajadores tienen que buscar defender sus privilegios
8426410 ahora se habla no solamente de fortalecer el estado y gobierno muchas de las pol ticas sino que se establece un estamento hay todo un titulo que se llama participaci n social y ciudadana en donde se establece la obligatoriedad a los sectores populares que adem s se garantiza su capacidad de autorganizarse de participar en la planificaci n en el control popular de la constituci n entonces el pueblo va a ser protagonista
8426411 eight former judges of the sindh high court took oath today
8426412 restaurant gordon ramsay has had a very good innings eight years at the top and still maintains very high standards
8426413 in the end though it is hardly surprising that an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8426414 indeed the ramsay empires current performance and in particular the poor standard of the more recent openings raises questions as to its direction and its ability to maintain its reputation as an operator of the highest quality
8426415 it is the culmination of many years hard work from myself and my team and also comes at the perfect time as i will open my own restaurant
8426416 if he wants me never to get to the status i want
8426417 then my advice to him is put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and ill come back ill never give up till i get where i want to go
8426418 we wanted to see your new song lyrics not some silly story about werebears and such
8426419 it is not because things are difficult that we do not dare it is because we do not dare that they are difficult
8426420 google does down every day and thats wrong i dont believe itll stay here long at all itll be back to 500 in no time
8426421 this is a fertilizer company and im concerned i dont like that sector right here id trim your position
8426422 i dont know why this stock is so low the market is wrong its got a lot of divisions that are doing well i like it
8426423 i have a good call of this one their financials are opaque i think theyll need more capital but i dont trust them
8426424 i think this is one of those moments where we have to wait and see i think you buy some and wait i want to bank with verizon
8426425 no no no i dont want to be there ever since they got spun off ive felt like theres just not enough there

8426438 obviously the moneys available and you get a fantastic return when you invest in the security of public health here in the province
8426439 when you no longer have nine or 10 ceos and you have one theres an obvious cost savings there long term
8426440 but i want to emphasize that the changes were making in health care are not about cost savings theyre about providing a more efficient effective health care system
8426441 will be given a clear number of who got what
8426442 georgia was increasingly likely or was before the war likely to become a major corridor for gas going from central asia to european markets
8426443 what happens here affects the fundamental security interests of the eu not least energy interests energy security
8426444 it also affects obviously the quality of our relationship with russia
8426445 the u s and several eu countries have been pushing for quite some time to have routes for oil and gas that would circumvent russian territory
8426446 the russians saw this as a direct threat to their interests
8426447 you cant tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued nsls to at amp t and verizon
8426448 if someone had told me 45 years ago of what were about to witness i would say youre crazy youre out of your mind
8426449 it is a major major step in making real the hopes and dreams and aspirations of so many americans who attended the march and who supported the march
8426450 this nation is still a place of cheap political leaders who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political economic and social exploitation
8426451 what political leader here can stand up and say my party is the party of principles
8426452 the democratic party has come such a distance from 1963
8426453 under the leadership of people like jimmy carter bill clinton and all that lyndon johnson said sen obama is the personification of what the democratic party is about
8426454 a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually
8426455 i just dont know whats going to be my reaction
8426456 i really dont i can see the 10 of us who stood after the march after the speeches and the music was over we went to the white house met with president kennedy he stood in the doorway of the oval office and met each of us and he was so proud and pleased that things went so well
8426457 when you go back and you look at the strategic review document none of it has ever been implemented but the thrust of what was discussed in that document was on the slaughter side not on the processing side that were talking about here today
8426458 those that might characterize paperwork in a derogatory sense i would challenge given that that scientific review demonstrates the safety and security of the entire process used to produce food
8426459 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8426460 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
8426461 we will not re start the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally

8426464 o ne of my plans is to not allow lawyers to be rotated in and out of divisions as much as they have been when you have three or four lawyers handling one case then somethings going to fall through the cracks
8426465 m y intent was to merely say congratulations what can i do to help you and your designee during the transition
8426466 f rankly i was deeply disappointed in the response and its really not a good message to give to the community when youre assuming a position as important as state attorney
8426467 eighty percent of the kids we bring over get placed
8426468 weve had 150 kids adopted over the years and 30 more adoptions are in the works
8426469 we help them have a good time without making any promises
8426470 i was a silicon valley sales guy for 21 years i got laid off in 2002 and a week later i was invited to speak at an adoption conference and help lead a bay area hosting program
8426471 our mission is to create an opportunity for kids to meet families we get the word out through churches the media and our network
8426472 in the past we had pursued adoption through santa clara county
8426473 it was very hard to get our foot in the door
8426474 we dont really miss russia because we like this place better
8426475 we like all the fun stuff and all the toys we have
8426476 we get doctor care and we get to go to church and we can get a good education
8426477 they didnt speak any english so we had to deal with translators
8426478 there was a fear of being sent back to the orphanage
8426479 and they would hoard food they would run out of food at the orphanage they didnt understand that you dont run out of food in america
8426480 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8426481 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8426482 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8426483 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8426484 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8426485 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8426486 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8426487 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8426488 before you tell me that you dont like the jonas brothers i want you to imagine the person you love most in the world
8426489 oh they are so gay everyone one who likes them is fucking stupid
8426490 its not something that im prepared to rule out at this time
8426491 we knew we had a toxin producing bacterium but we didnt know exactly what type now that we know that its an e coli bacterium that will help guide physicians in their care of patients
8426492 you cant be too cautious with this kind of situation
8426493 whenever you have kids that are seriously ill its a cause for concern
8426494 i make sure she knows to wash her hands every time she goes to the restroom or not to be touching her mouth or anything
8426495 were going to protect our kids the best we know how
8426496 marked enlargement of his heart which had been failing for some time
8426497 the populations that bear the greatest burden nationally blacks for example and men who have sex with men are highly represented in new york city
8426498 because hiv is more prevalent within those groups the risk of hiv infection per sexual contact is higher
8426499 this is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading hiv
8426500 this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest
8426501 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8426502 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8426503 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8426504 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8426505 i am anxious to continue my involvement to help get this sport back in the olympic games
8426506 we have 14 months to show the ioc that the sport of softball belongs at the olympic level i plan to assist in the education process for both athletes and coaches at all levels in order to keep the pipeline alive and healthy

8426512 the uk had nothing to do with planting the story
8426513 the lib dems in westminster were quick to criticise the serious fraud office for dropping its inquiry into bae and its alleged dealings with saudi arabia
8426514 do their lib dem colleagues in towns where bae systems is an important local employer agree with them
8426515 people simply wont stand for letting the unions hold us to ransom any more
8426516 limiting the power of the unions was a painful process but a necessary one which we have now completed

8426519 most of the world is bemused by western moralising on georgia

8426522 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8426523 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8426524 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8426525 i felt like absolute shit as a teenager when i was modelling and all i had around me was people telling me i was right
8426526 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8426527 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8426528 what they show is the areas where gps are picking this up and taking it most seriously
8426529 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8426530 generations from now we will be able to look back

8426561 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8426562 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8426563 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8426564 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8426565 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth

8426578 senor dios mio envianos a algunos locos de aquellos que se comprometen a fondo de aquellos que se olvidan de si mismos de aquellos que saben amar con fuerza y no palabras de aquellos que se entregan verdaderamente y no con palabras nos hacen falta locos capaces de dar el salto al vacio para rescatar suenos aunque no sean los propios nos hacen falta locos que defiendan pobres enamorados de una vida sencilla libertadores de angustia amantes de la paz

8426580 wer beteiligungs gestaltungs und beratungsm glichkeiten von und f r frauen beschneidet hat nicht das ziel eine verbesserung der studienbedingungen f r frauen herbeizuf hren
8426581 frau g mbel h tte vor ihrer kritik mal mit uns sprechen sollen
8426582 wir fanden das sinnvoll weil frauen an der uni keine minderheit mehr sind
8426583 einen anlaufpunkt f r frauen gibt es nach wie vor wir werden auch die beratung weiter f hren
8426584 man konnte dort einfach so hin und mitmachen es gab keine hierarchien
8426585 die vom asta fanden alles was wir gemacht hatten war keine gleichstellungspolitik
8426586 die politische arbeit des frauenreferats ist nicht mehr m glich
8426587 die m ssen jetzt f r jedes projekt asta betteln gehen
8426588 das ist sehr unsch n abgelaufen aber das war nicht der grund f r unsere entscheidung
8426589 ich finde es gut wenn frauenangelegenheiten nicht mehr unter dem aspekt der minderheiten wahrgenommen werden
8426590 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8426591 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8426592 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia
8426593 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8426594 it goes against the public markets policy of the government which requires them to stimulate competition and look for local alternatives its really an absurdity
8426595 a strategic free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs
8426596 however quebecs public administration refuses to even consider and evaluate these options
8426597 theres a general lack of awareness of the software sector by the people who are actually making individual acquisition decisions
8426598 the policies say everything is open but the practice becomes a little different
8426599 the proprietary software vendors have been very successful in convincing people in procurement whether in government or the private sector that software is a product and you buy it like you do an automobile
8426600 if you actually look at what software does its more like a service
8426601 station owners have to value whats in their tanks based on what the replacement costs are whats it going to cost them to buy off the rack basically
8426602 so when that price goes up theyre going to start raising the price at the pump although its usually a short term thing
8426603 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8426604 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita
8426605 katrina was an event that changed how the oil market reacts and responds to hurricane threats

8426609 the governments proposals to build three titans each housing around 2 500 prisoners would cement this countrys position as the prison capital of western europe while squandering billions of pounds of taxpayers money which could be better spent elsewhere the proposals ignore evidence that smaller local prisons work better than large ones raise serious concerns about the wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff and would put at risk relationships between prisoners and their families
8426610 resources should be used to improve the prison system not expand it and legislation should be introduced to reduce the use of custody not increase it
8426611 titan prisons could exacerbate already high levels of mental distress if prisoners are kept further from their families in larger more impersonal establishments
8426612 did you know that quebec a few years ago had a vote to either still be part of canada or to be an independent country o they lost the chance to become a country by just a very very small percentage very small
8426613 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8426614 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come

8426616 for an athlete to be successful today in the world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this being a us based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8426617 thats why i dont think this is an overall bad thing
8426618 i think it can also really help the players become more comfortable in the environment they play
8426619 we agree we should speak some english we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8426620 hillary rallied the troops threw her support to obama gave a nod to bill michelle and joe and threw a few punches at mccain however her fiery orange pantsuit spoke volumes its still all about her her healthcare policies her supporters and maybe even her comeback in 2012
8426621 while i have never been a hillary fan i thought she did a terrific job last night she struck the right tone to help bring her voting block along personally as an obama supporter i appreciated her performance and thought it hit all of the right notes
8426622 words words words yes she is a forceful speaker and some say the dems should have nominated her i disagree she has zero credibility with half the electorate does anyone believe her endorsement of obama is motivated by anything other than preserving her viability as presidential material next time
8426623 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8426624 she agrees with him on the issues but she didnt say that he was prepared
8426625 john mccain has a life time of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8426626 if the people lead the leaders will have to follow
8426627 do not speak about freedom of speech if you are not prepared for the consequences

8426639 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8426640 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8426641 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali

8426646 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8426647 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8426648 since multimedia often transcends linguistic barriers we thought it apt to help translate a multimedia player into local languages we chose vlc because it is undoubtedly the most popular open source media player available
8426649 at translate org za we believe that people express themselves best in their own language and people should be encouraged to create multimedia such as podcasts and sound bytes in their native languages
8426650 our way of empowering local languages is to help make popular software in these languages available
8426651 we also make it easier for volunteers by providing a simple web based translation system called pootle which is hosted at pootle locamotion org which makes it easy for anyone to help translate software
8426652 weve split the vlc language file into more workable chunks to make the number of source words more manageable
8426653 organisations such as ours can freely use open source software as a catalyst for creating language communities
8426654 anyone who wants to help translate vlc into their language can make use of our translation system
8426655 i have spoken to many of you who have expressed your questions about what you should do
8426656 now many of you feel a responsibility to represent the voters in the states that you came from and others of you after this long journey weve been on want the chance to vote for whats in your heart now still others will be voting for senator obama because they want to demonstrate their personal commitment to the unity of this party behind our nominee
8426657 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call
8426658 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8426659 senator rutelli in suggesting this singular european army have you completely forgotten that individual european countries will never abandon their own national interests do you really think that the uk would subvert their armed forces to a command run by the french

8426703 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8426704 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8426705 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8426709 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8426710 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8426711 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8426737 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8426738 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8426739 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8426740 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8426741 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8426742 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone

8426760 youll be putting more than just time and effort into your business
8426761 not everyone is comfortable working with an uncertain income or borrowing a lot of money when theres no guarantee of success
8426762 there is simply no way to separate the owner from the company in the early stages customers write checks to the company name but they think of themselves as doing business with the founder owner after all when a company is small there is really only one decisions matter the owner
8426763 you will likely spend more time with your business than with your family all the while working to improve your familys financial security

8426765 globalization especially the increasing connections of our economy with others around the world

8426767 he is able to address market needs and communicate in an engaging and straightforward manner he has a proven track record and his enthusiastic results oriented style has been instrumental in his success

8426771 lays out in clear terms the process the department is going to follow
8426772 we think this is a good compilation of best practices for health standards and thats why we are proposing it
8426773 they are spending their last months making it more difficult to put needed protections for workers in place in the future
8426774 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8426775 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection
8426776 to slip through a rule that may have a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers
8426777 but now they will stop at nothing to rush through significant regulatory changes that are detrimental to average americans
8426778 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8426779 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged

8426783 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8426784 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8426785 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8426786 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8426787 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8426788 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8426789 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8426790 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8426791 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8426792 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8426793 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8426794 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8426795 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8426796 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8426797 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8426798 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8426799 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8426800 he is presumed innocent until proven guilty oj has been a very bad person
8426801 if i did it this is the way it happened
8426802 females have never assisted men at making money and are always a money drain liability and dream killers
8426803 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8426804 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8426805 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8426806 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8426807 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8426808 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8426809 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8426810 a brother recently asked me what was the best way to overcome coldness of heart and a bound spirit when he sought to pray
8426811 the core markets are our bread and butter and they need constant attention to ensure revenue streams remain strong
8426812 we certainly made the message very clear with the government in the room and said we just believe that the investment that the government is making is too small
8426813 it keeps us at a level of tactical advertising and it doesnt allow us to put brand fiji on the map in a significant way
8426814 was only personally involved in bringing in about 1 million in total grants during his tenure
8426815 funneled to a defunct nonprofit headed by a longtime friend and former associate of felner
8426816 why i will never again serve on a search committee
8426817 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8426818 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8426819 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8426820 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8426821 no one works for someone we all just work together
8426822 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8426823 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8426824 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8426825 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8426826 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8426827 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8426828 we support the boom in the mining industry you have no shortage of people coming to see us but it is not absolute
8426829 what we say to the mining industry is that we have to do the right thing and we do reserve the right on behalf of the people of queensland to make appropriate decisions in the interest of the environment
8426830 thats my only fear having said that the deposits in the north west here obviously dont compare to the one on the great barrier reef
8426831 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8426832 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8426833 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8426834 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8426835 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8426836 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8426837 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8426838 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8426839 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8426840 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8426841 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8426842 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8426843 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8426844 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8426845 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8426846 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8426847 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8426848 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8426849 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8426850 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8426851 and despite meeting the cost down demands of its customers the company has decided to let 80 workers go
8426852 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8426853 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8426854 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8426855 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8426856 we received on tuesday the 1 450 kilograms of silver that we ordered in switzerland and we will start work in two or three days
8426857 we were able to buy the precious metal through thousands of donations from pilgrims
8426858 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8426859 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8426860 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8426861 if it wasnt for the interfaith i dont know where me and my kids would be
8426862 they done did so much great things for me and my family its wonderful to know that you got people they care for you they love you no matter what
8426863 everything in government is controversial but when youve got this many congregations from protestant catholic episcopal and jewish and every other kind of way this is something we all should be happy about
8426864 no one has ever come up to me and said you know i want to be homeless
8426865 the kids can play you know eat as much as they want to eat at night time we have somewhere to lay our heads
8426866 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8426867 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8426868 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8426869 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8426870 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8426871 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8426872 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8426873 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8426874 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8426875 if youre talking about maintaining the viability of and prosperity of regional communities you need to have diverse economies and that includes agriculture mining tourism
8426876 what advice tips suggestions do you have for the certification candidates
8426877 one thing we do know is that wellwood will not be bringing a physical presence to the canucks he has not had a penalty of any kind his last two seasons quite simply he is here to try and help kickstart a moribund canuck offence
8426878 it was totally bogus but kind of killer because some dude caught it on his vid cam
8426879 the civilized world had been thoroughly saturated with christianity for 2 000 years and a culture based on this religion could only be captured from within
8426880 there is no doubt that it is around the family and the home that all the greatest virtues the most dominating virtues of human society are created strengthened and maintained
8426881 by far the most important channel of transmission of culture remains the family and when family life fails to play its part we must expect our culture to deteriorate
8426882 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
8426883 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
8426884 i love working with the team at x play and working with adam amp eve and hustler
8426885 we always have fun doing these parodies and honestly who hasnt wondered what would happen if they really got it on in these tv classics
8426886 haruki murakami offers a tough love take on running marathons and writing novels
8426887 murakami stresses the importance of training in both disciplines debunking misconceptions about the writerly life as he goes
8426888 the whole process sitting at your desk focusing your mind like a laser beam imagining something out of a blank horizon creating a story selecting the right words one by one keeping the whole flow of the story on track requires far more energy over a long period than most people ever imagine
8426889 the very first thing i tell my new students on the first day of a workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth
8426890 cr pes la baies port et cr me de noix
8426891 because you see he was not willing to give imus the benefit of any doubt and was one of the very first self righteous public figures to jump up and to call for imus to be fired he was not willing to take anything into the context of his life and the good works he had done but yet he wanted us all to consider jeremiah wrights words in the context of his life and works
8426892 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible

8426894 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury mullin said
8426895 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8426896 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8426897 training camp was going to be an important part of his development mullin said
8426898 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do
8426899 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas mullin said mentioning more shots for stephen jackson al harrington and newcomer corey maggette
8426900 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8426901 im all for guys training and getting better mullin said
8426902 ideally id like everybody here in oakland all the time but thats not realistic i think one thing monta has done each and every year is improve and i do believe most improvement is made during the summer thats when guys do get better so i cant debate that
8426903 a fantastic book for anyone looking to learn the tools and techniques needed to break in and stay in

8426908 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8426909 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8426910 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8426911 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8426912 if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8426913 ive been tasked with finding a way to bury digitally stored photographs in a small underground time capsule to be opened in 25 years it looks like well be using a steel vessel welded closed ive thought of cds dvds a hard drive or a thumb drive but they all have drawbacks not the least of which is outdated technology 25 years from now maybe ill put a cd and a cd rom drive in the capsule and hope that the ide interface is still around in 25 years ideas and feedback will be appreciated

8426928 angesichts der zuletzt konstant schlechten nachrichten von den finanz und kreditm rkten war es sch n zur abwechslung mal etwas positives zu h ren
8426929 das vorherrschende gef hl ist nicht dass die situation viel besser geworden ist aber dass der grad der abw rtsbewegung nachgelassen haben k nnte in diesem umfeld ist das genug um optimismus zu erzeugen

8426937 the present is the new music project of legendary new york musician and producer rusty santos panda bear person pitch born ruffians red yellow amp blue animal collective sung tongs described by one band who worked with him as a hyper boy genius rusty has always fixed his attention on producing music that is experimentally rich while remaining accessible by attempting to create music that arises unconsciously through improvisation the presents debut album world i see hauls this ethos over its shoulders as it tramples on musical boundaries and preconceptions whilst leaving an album that is still capable of relating musically and emotionally to a wide audience
8426938 we found your workshop to be informative educational and very entertaining we would certainly recommend this seminar to other financial planners
8426939 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8426940 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8426941 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8426942 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8426943 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8426944 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8426945 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8426946 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8426947 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8426948 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8426949 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8426950 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8426951 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8426952 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8426953 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8426954 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8426955 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8426956 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8426957 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8426958 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8426959 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8426960 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8426961 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8426962 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8426963 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8426964 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8426965 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8426966 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8426967 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8426968 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8426969 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8426970 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8426971 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8426972 it is something the children look forward to doing each month
8426973 and it is a great way for them to meet people in the community
8426974 its fabulous to see the boys helping others and it makes you proud to be part of the community
8426975 we are always in need of more volunteers and all it takes is a couple of hours a month to make a real difference
8426976 on the albury to melbourne route weve seen solid growth with a 10 per cent increase in passenger numbers on the previous financial year
8426977 from 2006 to 2007 we had 36 000 passengers on that route which rose to 40 000 in the 2007 08 period
8426978 it was a major objective of ours to try to maintain passenger levels on the sydney route and we have
8426979 after 11 years of running the event it was a was an incredibly hard decision but in the end it came down to costs
8426980 people are coming in and looking for a place because they have sold their home and might be looking to downsize and rent for a few months until they work out whether they are going to buy again
8426981 and a lot of people might still be in the rental market while they wait and see what the interest rates are doing
8426982 we also get a few members from companies like uncle bens moving to the area and looking to rent
8426983 in my eight years in real estate i dont think the rate would have ever been at 6 per cent
8426984 being a grocer used to be about loving to serve customers the last thing i want to do is become a policeman its very sad
8426985 our staff live locally and know the locals jindera only has a population of 900
8426986 they all have the same strategy which makes me think they know each other and talk about strategy

8427001 there are about 10 million roma and sinti people in europe they make up europes largest ethnic minority and for generations they have been excluded from many of the social welfare provisions that are available to everyone else
8427002 nowhere assuredly except here spencer at once the noblest cause that ever was lost in unmitigated din and discord yet none the worse
8427003 well this one is 20lb test and 1400 kilowatts and 100 feet long
8427004 im very concerned as to what they think of us
8427005 that is honestly the first time ive ever been asked that question ive been married and had the children today
8427006 there is no political intent in this film it is just funny
8427007 after reading the part that was handwritten for me i was not sure if i should be flattered or insulted im still a bit unsure
8427008 its a really funny script and we didnt see any reason to wander off course
8427009 we just thought lets do a spy movie because we hadnt done one before
8427010 on his web site was arrested wednesday and appeared in court where his bail was set at 10 000
8427011 i didnt think our performance was that great and if we had lost the game id have thought we had no one to blame but ourselves scoring is the best feeling in the world better than drinking and sex but obviously the players dont agree with me
8427012 i was expecting more from my side i didnt expect us to be trailing against macclesfield
8427013 but we were better in the second half and eventually broke them down
8427014 we were not guilty of complacency it was just that our game went to pieces with those two goals leicester scored but we have come out of it with a couple of positives one that we were able to find our game again and two that we learned a lot of lessons without paying the full price
8427015 maybe the result was a bit unfair but after all thats life
8427016 im happy that we gave it a good go and im not going to moan too much
8427017 britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8427018 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8427019 we knew it could be difficult and from the first minute they played well we needed to work extremely hard until the very end for me the most positive thing was that we played much better than we have done recently against a good team that looked really sharp
8427020 we knew this tie might finish with penalties but we showed the confidence to keep pushing forwards
8427021 pepe reina was clearly the key player in the first leg but i dont think you can talk about just one player tonight all the players worked hard to get us through standard li ge were sharp well organised and in these kind of games you know these teams are only training and thinking about this one game we have had to train without our olympic players we had the international break and we had to use players who are not ready but now we can start working again for the group stage
8427022 in two 90 minute games against liverpool they didnt score and in two 90 minute games against my friend mourinhos team liverpool didnt score but we both suffered
8427023 it is the mourinho story over again and so i think i should call him
8427024 i am very sad because we played so well and we deserved to go through we were very well organised in both games we didnt see the real liverpool in these two games but the team with the most luck and the biggest name won the tie not the best team we had a lot of good situations especially in the first half but we couldnt score we had a very big guy in reina in front of us and congratulations to him but my players are sitting in the dressing room trying to find the answers for how we lost this game
8427025 its not a piece of reality tv its real tv its lovingly crafted
8427026 what is remarkable about the hughes family is that they are in many ways unremarkable i think theyre an antidote to some of the larger than life characters we see on television today
8427027 its clear that the worldwide economic issues affecting businesses are having an impact on where and how advertisers spend their money
8427028 it is also significant that the us and the uk as the highest spenders on advertising in their regions are showing reductions in our forecasts
8427029 until the age of 16 by which point she already had an adams apple a deep voice and facial hair
8427030 some parents whose children have gender identity issues are already angry about the fact that few professionals have been invited from abroad
8427031 the dutch data on gender suspension looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up
8427032 always completely focused on the person he was with whether patient or colleague
8427033 we spoke about this already and so i mean it ought to be right
8427034 you must know what is wrong and how to correct it
8427035 cannot stand wrong intonation i know i put the conductors in an embarrassing situation but they have to be able to do it
8427036 you dont hear what they are doing you are in your own world and you are going too quickly
8427037 you have to know the culture to know the score and to project what you want to hear some conductors are well prepared but cannot transmit their ideas to an orchestra and others are good communicators but have nothing to transmit because they are not absorbed enough in the score
8427038 but i am doing a lot of things they may be small movements but they are directed exactly to the musician who needs them and in performance the force is always more because of the excitement of the concert
8427039 you have to impose your will not with a hammer but you have to be able to convince people of your point of view
8427040 audiences follow the orchestra the problem is that performers say oh my god if i programme schoenberg nobody will come and thats not true last year with the berlin philharmonic i played music by bart k schoenberg berg and webern the literature of before the first world war and i was told by some people that this was a difficult programme i say all these works are composed before 1914 thats not new do you think in 1940 people were saying my god tristan und isolde is so difficult to listen to 80 years after it was written the 20th century is famous for being the century of speed but the speed is not there when it comes to culture i find
8427041 i can live for months without performance and i am not deprived at all
8427042 i am looking more and more to write works on a long trajectory
8427043 all the people with whom i was very close at one point in my life stockhausen berio ligeti nono bernd alois zimmermann they are all gone
8427044 with berio with whom i kept a good relationship we only met once a year or so and with stockhausen we had almost no contact in the last decades because he made himself alone
8427045 i also live rather alone in business in the music world people know that i can be very friendly and warm but that after a certain moment the business is closed i like to be alone in order to concentrate on my work the social life does not exist it has never existed for me really i have chosen instead the working life because i prefer that i like to work otherwise i do not know what i would do
8427046 after the mahler i will go to baden baden where i have a house far away from this madding world
8427047 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres no food at all i remember standing up in the bath one day and i was so thin i was never anorexic i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8427048 i remember i came back from a job in paris and the stylist said to me have you been eating too many croissants karen
8427049 fashion is obsessed with finding young beautiful and vulnerable girls bringing them into the fashion world praising them worshipping them but suddenly dropping them like a stone when they hit puberty and grow boobs and hips its so dangerous and can potentially harm the girls mentally and physically

8427051 a player may not play uefa club competition matches for more than one competing club in the course of the same season
8427052 fielded for another club that is currently in the same competition
8427053 i note the comments on the newcastle website the contents of which disappoint me because james milner was left with no option in his opinion but to formally ask for a transfer following the clubs total refusal to offer him a new contract
8427054 he was simply asking for an improvement that reflects his development
8427055 having played over 50 games last season and 160 games in the premier league he believed his improvement warranted a new contract it was made clear on two occasions there was not going to be a new contract therefore he felt that he was left with no option
8427056 hed rather sign players he knows even overpay he doesnt like the unknown because it takes him out of his comfort zone
8427057 i havent discussed it with garry but i will have a chat with him i dont think i am particularly old fashioned it is very easy to sit in your comfort zone but i dont think i have done that either as a player or a manager i have deliberately put myself in different positions throughout my career
8427058 if they are obviously the right standard signing a big name player would possibly help that and help me but it wont help the team if you buy lads at the back end of their career just looking for a final payday
8427059 we are trying to move forward on all fronts but if i feel a player cant make an impact on the team it does not matter who he is he wont be coming
8427060 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8427061 in the end though it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8427062 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8427063 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8427064 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8427065 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8427066 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8427067 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8427068 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8427069 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change
8427070 put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and come back ill never give up until i get where i want to go
8427071 he robinho is still in madrid but hopefully that will change over the next few days
8427072 these things always go to the wire but im confident we will get it done and robinho is absolutely committed to coming here he understands we want him and the coach luiz felipe scolari is 100 behind it
8427073 hes the right age and he comes from madrid so he understands what a big club is all about
8427074 what were doing is supporting scolari he wants to change and move the style a bit and is confident about the players ability and mentality and that he will fit in and make an impact
8427075 you have to look at things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8427076 he has started the season very well and is a good striker who is on form
8427077 if we can pick four points up that would be very good
8427078 if a player is under stress it can make a huge difference to his performance and we can help him deal with it
8427079 its something of real benefit and will help me pick teams

8427124 we believe that it will be necessary to consider a more centralised elector registration system not necessarily taken out of local administrative control but being run with whatever degree of decentralised delivery best guarantees a balance of efficiency and access
8427125 sufficient identifiers should be included in electoral registers for them to become in effect a national database for cross checking purposes
8427126 if there were individual identifiers that would make postal votes more secure
8427127 everyone involved with elections is keen to promote the idea of more secure voting
8427128 the government is committed to the highest standards in the administration of elections and we will carefully consider these proposals
8427129 while the electoral commissions report into the may 2008 gla greater london authority and local elections found that these had generally been run smoothly we are not complacent and we will continue to work with administrators and the commission to ensure that elections are run efficiently and effectively

8427149 when compared to traditional pcs thin clients consume less power are easier to manage and require less maintenance
8427150 when all these benefits are coupled with the fact that thin clients can help a company reduce its ecological footprint its clear why thin clients are experiencing staggering growth
8427151 many business leaders believe environmentally friendly alternatives will compromise productivity

8427243 dont foresee getting swept with those three pitchers but we have to deal with it and move on
8427244 the first day we were here haren pitched really well and today for them to win both of those games and sweep us the off day might be coming at the right time for us
8427245 you could sense we got a little bit too tight
8427246 weve been through several periods like that this year where we had to respond and we have weve had a lot of games where we have been heartbroken this year
8427247 weve had issues earlier with closing out games its been a problem for us all year but weve always responded
8427248 as far as pitching and changing speeds thats as good as i have seen him
8427249 im not going to say it was a bad pitch

8427303 ive spoken to ian and i dont buy that comment
8427304 ive heard nothing from nick i have not been given any indication which direction hes going with his picks i have no clue what hes doing to do
8427305 its a difficult situation because if he was playing gleneagles this week he would basically give up his chance of winning the fedexcup
8427306 he gives up his chance to win 10 million and the possibility of playing for huge world ranking points
8427307 having said that justin rose has been over there cementing his place in the team hes given up his chance of winning 10 million saying its only money you cant take it with you
8427308 its great to see darren playing well on a personal level and its good from a euro golf standpoint
8427309 its nice to have a difficult situation like this because it means weve got lots of great players
8427310 i would certainly think about that decision and anything that would help the european cause i would be for
8427311 i would help in any way shape or form potentially yes
8427312 no id consider getting my game ready to make sure i make it in 2010
8427313 bernhard langer did that when he was left out in 1999
8427314 he was determined and made sure he was on the team the next time and that would be my goal
8427315 the ryder cup has brought the best out of me everybody tells me why dont you just play the way you in the ryder cup as tom lehman said in america wed be delighted if monty is not playing i think that says a lot
8427316 to get selected i think ive got to show some form i havent become a bad player im just sort of out of form and have been for the last month
8427317 but i feel very much more confident having had a weeks holiday away from the game and after practicing here last week
8427318 youre reading too much into that hopefully im past the stage of justifying my ryder cup potential or otherwise
8427319 everybody here and im sure that i speak for the captain as well understands my love for the ryder cup and thats how i will be remembered if you like
8427320 theres no resignation in any way shape or form i just felt i wanted to turn my game around and the best way to do that was practice up here and prepare the way that i have
8427321 maybe he feels like hes done enough thats all i can imagine
8427322 i think its going to be a tricky decision that nick faces
8427323 just reading between the lines he poulter is certainly very well placed in terms of world rankings 23rd against caseys 35th darren clarkes 56th and colin montgomeries 91st and the open is still relatively recent in my opinion
8427324 but i havent spoken to him this week and ill be quite interested obviously to hear what his thoughts are
8427325 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8427326 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8427327 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8427328 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8427329 i cant really speak for anybody playing or not playing he has his own schedule
8427330 you might have thought he would have known that before he entered or pulled out of here
8427331 im pretty much at a loss for words to describe how i feel
8427332 from 1992 until now they never even let me know about it
8427333 given the number of different taxes imposed on canadians it is virtually impossible to know exactly how much tax we pay
8427334 the point of tax freedom day is to give people a

8427349 its been a long time since california was in play for a republican
8427350 this emphasis stems from a long history of concern for gods creation
8427351 we as humans have a responsibility to care for that creation i realize that some question what does bottled water have to do with the gospel i respond that ucc has a wide range of issues it is concerned with to do with wellbeing of life we do have a strong belief in the importance of faith in peoples lives
8427352 the focus is to encourage the 3 600 or so ucc congregations in canada we need to begin with our own people but yes there is an evangelical call to encourage others to be respectful of gods creation
8427353 the more those who can afford bottled water depend on bottled water the harder it is for communities to muster political and financial support for urgent upgrades to public water systems that most people depend on to provide safe affordable water
8427354 weve eliminated the huge operational advertising cost happened at the traditional brick and mortar store meanwhile gaining a high traffic environment

8427363 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
8427364 the aim is that you can go online and call up the scrolls with the best possible resolution and all the information that exists about them today
8427365 ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims but if it is not possible to resolve a dispute then we will be preparing a submission to the un clcs anyway as the uk
8427366 i can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by may 2009
8427367 it is clearly having read a bit about it a very long term project
8427368 ascension island is going to be the only territorial claim that is relatively unproblematic
8427369 there could always be a scientific spanner in the works but its going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the islands continental shelf
8427370 there is combat every day in this province and that isnt going to end any time soon
8427371 we are going to stay in the fight and we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents
8427372 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to control this province at this time the answer is no
8427373 this blatant disregard for human life is simply not acceptable
8427374 i am happy to report we that we have had very few civilian casualties as a result of our operations in kandahar province this year something to do with our roes on calling in air strikes mc
8427375 we deeply regret any accidental loss of life that occurs as a result of our actions
8427376 the raid destroyed one of the largest ied factories to date within zhari panjwaii and seriously disrupted the insurgents ability to produce and deploy improvised explosive devices
8427377 there is no doubt many lives have been saved as a result of these operations
8427378 let me be clear we do expect further attacks you dont have to look very hard to find proof that there are serious challenges to security across afghanistan
8427379 continue to do everything in our power to counter this threat

8427382 this is not a frequent occurrence but we have had viruses that have made their way on board before
8427383 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8427384 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8427385 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8427386 at first we thought it was a helicopter but then another light appeared and another and another
8427387 more kept appearing until there were about eight or ten of them and they were absolutely silent
8427388 they came over from the hedge over the house quite high up we went out to the front and they carried on out towards bridgwater
8427389 quite a lot of military aircraft go over this area but they make a lot of noise and it was absolutely silent and calm
8427390 i definitely think it was a ufo it was an unidentified flying object
8427391 it was very strange when they were coming over i was shaking i was scared i had never seen anything like it before and we didnt know what it was
8427392 i looked on the internet and there have been similar sightings a few miles away in chard
8427393 if john mccain is the answer then the question is clearly ridiculous
8427394 why did she need to step into the spotlight again
8427395 i was born a brit i will die a brit
8427396 she knows where are all the bodies have been buried in the past 30 or so years of chicago politics and she knows all the tricks
8427397 if obama had a political and financial godmother it would be valerie
8427398 jarrett has done that for barack and michelle three or four times over
8427399 that and her ties to chicago politicians and her iranian background and you have a potential nightmare
8427400 say what you want about hillary but she didnt have that kind of a triple threat on her team
8427401 i was born a brit i will die a brit
8427402 so what happened to your unlying racial perceptions just curious if it changed from you original estimation
8427403 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8427404 my father was a racist i am not where i came from alabama every 10 persons i saw 3 5 of them were black so naturally people become friends and intermarry etc only now they dont have to hide
8427405 i was born a brit i will die a brit
8427406 my father was a racist i am not where i came from alabama every 10 persons i saw 3 5 of them were black so naturally people become friends and intermarry etc only now they dont have to hide
8427407 he is such a coward that he refused to have ten debates with mccain if he was such a good debater then why wouldnt he want to debate him as much as he possibly could
8427408 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8427409 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8427410 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8427411 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8427412 but it will never happen cost free it is not a cost free business anyone who says that is misleading and i dont intend to say that
8427413 what i detect overall from the business community is actually something quite good none of them have said to me so far oh by the way we dont want to act on climate change
8427414 roll the clock back a few years and it might have been the starting point
8427415 that document will show us once and for all what hes proposing as an easier cop for the big end of town and whether the minister knew about it
8427416 and the minister has yet to make a determination on this proposal
8427417 indian companies should take proactive measures to ensure adequate risk appraisal and management as well as leverage opportunities arising out of climate change they need to do proper due diligence for clean development mechanism cdm projects to assess the quantum of carbon credits expected to be generated indian businesses also need to consider tax and regulatory issues and devise strategies to help ensure that they can maximise the benefit from the cdm process
8427418 government priorities in the last five years or so have been very clearly environment security of supply and way down the list has been price all of a sudden affordability has shot to the top
8427419 if oil drops back to 80 then government can probably live with it the extra cost of climate policies
8427420 weve seen a worsening more to do with economic weakness than anything else its much harder to push through or in some cases even maintain support packages that push up energy costs when consumers are under pressure
8427421 if oil comes below 100 the consumer will bear it
8427422 i am continually impressed by the ability of our outlets to set such high benchmarks and then continue to go above and beyond all expectations
8427423 i would like to acknowledge all the members of our team at conrad treasury for their commitment and energy during the past 12 months
8427424 si adds air force customers whereas sercos business is exposed to the army and navy
8427425 the acquisition will also add to sercos capabilities in the us and increase its access to higher growth markets
8427426 we are seeing good growth in defence including in the uk and australia
8427427 we tend to get more phone calls from governments and private sector customers saying that they need to do more for less money
8427428 in defence if you have shrinking budgets people will stop procuring new kit such as airplanes and weapons
8427429 they will use what they have got and hire people who know how to get the existing product to go further
8427430 this is a business where we want to expand we will be absolutely keen to keep all of them
8427431 india already has a middle class of 200 million people and it is growing
8427432 it is a territory we are familiar with and we will take a look over the next few years
8427433 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8427434 in response to the current challenging circumstances we continue to actively manage our cost base to achieve productivity gains and in a manner which will protect the long term prospects of the group we expect to deliver a result reflective of these initiatives and the difficult market conditions

8427448 i cant believe you started a fight in front of the kids
8427449 you dont get anything without a fight in this life
8427450 when youre driving around in the van together all the time
8427451 if youre having an off day we know how not to wind each other up
8427452 and we say right you go round the back here and ill go round the front there we try to avoid digging our elbows into one anothers heads and there have been a few ripped shirts going round the marimba but there are other numbers where it works itself out musically at certain moments we look across at one another its like chamber music when we first started playing together it just seemed to click
8427453 it was just a hobby nothing serious i went to a normal state school and it had a really good music department they had a percussion group and they were short of percussionists they asked me if i wanted to do it and i said yes
8427454 after school i had a couple of years out getting lessons in glasgow i had to work hard and go back to basics then i went to college thats where i met owen
8427455 when i was about 10 i played several instruments piano trumpet but i wasnt very good i didnt practise much i preferred football but then my brother started playing percussion i really liked the fact that he was moving around because im really fidgety always running about and it just looked my cup of tea
8427456 and instead of getting bar jobs we started trying to get gigs through friends of friends
8427457 the third or fourth night we had two people in the audience my mum and his mum but then we got a review and it was really busy it was good experience making it audience friendly for a spectrum of people we did the fringe three years on the trot its not many groups who get 30 concerts in their first year
8427458 the hardest thing is to make it work as a performance
8427459 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
8427460 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
8427461 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
8427462 my job in the partnership is to raise the mood
8427463 i tell him come on harry still being in telly is not the end of the world
8427464 the point of that is to show that were dinosaurs
8427465 a listener has sent in a chocolate sponge cake in the shape of an uzi how thoughtful
8427466 the danger of being in fashion is that one day youll be out of fashion youre cutting off your nose to spite your face if you try to be self consciously cutting edge
8427467 ive never felt cutting edge maybe loadsamoney was for a few months but after that ive just done family stuff what paul and i do is not fashionable its a load of silly characters mucking about
8427468 i actually think the mighty boosh and peep show and armstrong and miller are all really good that makes us sound down with the kids doesnt it
8427469 for a while with the success of shows like the office and nighty night all comedy seemed so cool
8427470 i had no desire to go back on telly because that was not what i did
8427471 weve got loads of stuff for a third series in the laptop
8427472 we just hope we get an audience with this one
8427473 but of course on a worldwide scale its not much of a problem compared with whats happening in say darfur or south ossetia finding an audience for your comedy show is not that significant
8427474 think of the publicity the russians have got for their invasion i think we should invade the mighty boosh we should get a tank and take them over we would agree to leave but then stay indefinitely
8427475 i like you so awfully i think you are such a ripping good sort
8427476 im very conscious of the power that i feel in the music which comes from everything that it has been its ancestral line the phase that were in is one where the music is communicating with the world
8427477 you could put us in the most luxurious penthouse imaginable in malibu or chelsea but well still want to get back to the desert as quickly as possible theres nothing that compares the simplicity the peace the freedom so my vision of the next record is something soft sweet and quiet which expresses the real spirit of the desert and why were homesick for it
8427478 what were trying to encourage them towards is a kind of tamashek pet sounds whereby theyre thinking for themselves about how they can use the recording studio and create new atmospheres there
8427479 for the other girls i wouldnt want this to happen to anybody else i wouldnt want anybody else to have to go through this nobodys daughter i think that maybe next time if a case comes up hell take it more serious
8427480 come peek in my window at all hours anytime you like
8427481 come into the backyard and take a look in my shed
8427482 ook voor bestuurders van zorgverzekeraars moet een maximumsalaris gaan gelden
8427483 het kabinet wil dus helemaal geen eisen stellen gezien de hoge salarissen kan dat niet zorgverzekeringen zijn een verplichte verzekering voor iedere nederlander premiegeld is dus net zo goed publiek geld voor de salarissen inclusief bonussen van bestuurders van zorgverzekeraars moet dus net als voor de salarissen van de rest van de bestuurders in de zorgsector een maximum gelden
8427484 dat wekt het vermoeden dat zij wat te verbergen hebben
8427485 id rather be in the corner onstage it feels the safest
8427486 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
8427487 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
8427488 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
8427489 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
8427490 last night she set the stage and tonight she finished it
8427491 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8427492 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8427493 i think she accomplished what she needed to accomplish which was to tell her loyal followers to get on board to remember that theyre a democrat and to vote democratic
8427494 i think she couldve been a little more supportive of obama
8427495 like could have said im sorry i said those things like he wouldnt make a good commander in chief i think she shouldve thrown that in
8427496 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right and the status quo just wont cut it
8427497 now let me tell you if you think youve seen dramatic changes in the world in technology in the last ten years you aint seen nothing yet
8427498 unlike senator clinton i have no kind of ambiguity about my candidate
8427499 she said her candidate is unprepared to be president i announced when i was running that if i wasnt running i would support john mccain so im very enthusiastic
8427500 if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama we are going to have somebody who answers that phone
8427501 she has broke so many stereotypes changed the perception forever gotten rid of the notion that no longer a woman could be president that is over those days are gone
8427502 i want to say this up front i honor john mccains service to our country he served in uniform with honor and distinction and he deserves we owe him gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8427503 los primeros palauanos ten an una talla normal y que sus caracter sticas f sicas se encuentran dentro de una variaci n observada en las poblaciones humanas modernas

8427505 had it not been for not just the speech but the movement behind the speech and the sentiments behind the speech the work and the toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
8427506 we live in a moment right now where we are color blind and color mute we act like we dont see it and we dont talk about it or name it
8427507 to talk about race is to indict someone you have to talk about racism when he even calls himself a black man it renders him marginal to a whole set of people
8427508 i think that the noteworthiness of the moment will be apparent to everyone
8427509 during the course of a 19 month campaign i think that youre on the television screen youre in big auditoriums but sometimes who you are may get lost
8427510 and i want people to come away saying i know what he stands for i know where he comes from i know what he believes
8427511 he is going to be using the speech to persuade people who are alienated by civil rights
8427512 he is going to try to stay above that and he has to do it because of the force and strength of american racism people want to hear the high notes

8427519 with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8427520 the federal reserve bank of boston has been making important contributions to new england banking and economic growth for more than 90 years
8427521 we take pride in this heritage of public service and are happy to see it commemorated so well in our former home
8427522 history is part of our langham heritage the original langham in london was europes first grand hotel we are proud of our history at the langham boston and are pleased to share it with our guests
8427523 we are battening down the hatches it could be six 12 maybe 18 months
8427524 i think the single most important lesson is the speed of reaction slowing land purchases attacking costs hard
8427525 marginal projects will be put on hold as financial pressure on housebuilders intensifies and transaction volumes remain low pushing government housebuilding targets further into the wilderness a rapid policy rethink is vital if 2m homes are to be built by 2016 to achieve government targets
8427526 housebuilding is set to fall below 100 000 over the next year with housing starts already down 25 to reduce the excesses of this boom and bust cycle a more sustainable approach to housebuilding needs to be enacted sooner rather than later
8427527 the state of the economy is very worrying and i dont think people have properly factored in how bad things really are
8427528 for now we expect a modest contraction of about 0
8427529 all this supports our view that interest rates will eventually fall much further than the markets currently expect for now we are sticking to our prediction that rates will drop to 3 5 next year but we think it is quite plausible that they fall even further
8427530 another day brings another gloomy prediction the brown bubble has burst and thanks to labours incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8427531 we have a 10 shot but i owe it to my supporters to keep fighting
8427532 while a lot of towns have suffered some economic setbacks recently we have not
8427533 we didnt become the crossroads of the oil industry by any great design
8427534 it wasnt that a bunch of guys got together and said they were going to build an oil system and put cushing at the centre it just evolved
8427535 more hedging more use of contracts for risk mitigation and financial players using the market to speculate and make money
8427536 the storage capacity is large even more mind boggling is the flow of oil in pipelines through cushing
8427537 they say if you took a claw and turned up the ground here it would look like a bowl of pasta
8427538 the last three or four years have been the first time in a number of years that things seemed to be working to our benefit as a community
8427539 were an oil town weve been an oil town for a hundred years we know there are ups and downs and we try to prepare ourselves for the downs
8427540 theres no such thing as being 100 prepared but you do your best for what you see as a threat
8427541 it would be a real catastrophe if someone hit it just right
8427542 leveraging on the success of this hotel globally and in singapore i am very much looking forward to taking it to new levels of excellence together with our team of ladies and gentlemen
8427543 we have a 10 shot but i owe it to my supporters to keep fighting
8427544 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8427545 hay una obligaci n de los medios y periodistas de ser lo m s responsables posibles sobre todo en transmitir la noticia de tal modo que llegue tal cual aconteci sin manipularla minimizarla o magnificarla
8427546 hay injusticia con los periodistas de radio peri dicos y televisi n que fueron golpeados y amedrentados como el caso de canal 7 la red patria nueva pat unitel red uno y otros
8427547 los grupos que amedrentan act an en correlato a lo que discursan sus l deres porque cuando hay un prefecto por ah o autoridad nacional que lanza mensajes agresivos ya sean contra un medio o el adversario lo que hacen estos sectores es replicar estos mensajes
8427548 no obstante dado los problemas que existen en el pa s los medios de comunicaci n y los periodistas pues no est n a la altura del proceso que estamos viviendo en el pa s
8427549 en estos momentos no hay eso entonces existe un desface del sustento tico que es lo fundamental en cuanto a una visi n pol tica donde los periodistas est n para orientar y dar pautas a la construcci n de medidas correctivas y preventivas
8427550 en la actualidad eso no sucede y por el contrario existe confusi n y desde el punto de vista de la apdhb la noticia se magnifica en demas a y es un fen meno m s de car cter medi tico que no expresa el sentir de todo este proceso
8427551 thats a drastic change from a week before where multiplexes were reluctant to allocate even two shows per day to phoonk because of low confidence levels in the film but all thats changed now since the weekend showed proved that phoonk is already a hit
8427552 that decides whether the film is a hit or not
8427553 the photobucket deal 3 million for a 20 stake in a social media company with
8427554 instead the 3 billion fund generally makes late stage investments of about 35 million in companies that that have upwards of 25 million in sales
8427555 throws cold water on an informative account of the inner workings of venture capital funds
8427556 the investment was made in full compliance with the letter and spirit of all of insights agreements with its limited partners
8427557 perhaps they should have told us about this but it was such a small deal would we have wanted a piece of it in hindsight sure but for every one of these successes there are a hundred failures
8427558 there was a lot of emotion a lot of time a lot of commitment
8427559 as i became invested i really did become tied to her as a person
8427560 the important thing to remember is that shes not going away she is going to be a big part of the obama presidency in terms of support
8427561 she will create something out of whole cloth that will blow our minds the best is yet to come from her
8427562 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state
8427563 i was glad to visit with mayor gill and get an update from her on the downtown revitalization projects progress
8427564 pierre has made great strides and i look forward to continuing to partner with city leadership to keep their revitalization effort moving forward
8427565 mayor tidball was kind enough to make time to tour ft pierre today and update me on the major projects in town
8427566 it is always a pleasure to spend time in the pierre area and i thank both mayors for their timely updates and continued partnership as we work together to improve the capital area
8427567 i was pleased to meet with the mayors and city managers and discuss issues of importance to the residents of these canadian county communities
8427568 as a former mayor of tulsa i understand the pressures on communities resulting from our growing infrastructure needs and unfunded federal mandates that is why through my leadership position on the senate environment and public works committee i am proud to have successfully worked in the senate to pass two major transportation bills including the reauthorization of the highway bill and the water resource development act it is also why i have made unfunded federal mandates a top priority as to ensure that communities across the country are not left short handed while attempting to fulfill federal requirements
8427569 yukon certainly appreciates the continued personal involvement of senator inhofe in our needs and concerns for unfunded mandates water and infrastructure senator inhofe is and continues to be a good friend to yukon and all of her citizens
8427570 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject

8427573 making him believe she had engaged him in a romantic relationship according to a news release from the district attorneys office
8427574 the public expects quick and direct information from the police department about incidents that may affect their neighborhood or commute
8427575 twitter is one service of many that allows us to do that
8427576 public information officers get the information from the officers on the street and we put it out
8427577 to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question what are you doing
8427578 as technology advances we are always looking for new tools to communicate with the public
8427579 we do not accept that israel can stop these boats
8427580 palestinians have the same rights as all other peoples why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians
8427581 on monday the palestinian government gave me palestinian citizenship including a passport on tuesday im already in an israeli jail
8427582 we israelis know about kassam rockets on sderot but we never relate to the fact that gaza has been under siege
8427583 were sending a message the facility is closed and we want to make sure we dont put anyone children especially in a dangerous situation on the water this lake is unpredictable
8427584 it is still august and there is no reason the beach should be closed in august its warm and the beach should be open
8427585 it makes you want to do what you can do theres so much still needed from katrina so hopefully there isnt another one theyre going to get like that
8427586 when people cant get into the shelter for feeding they would put this to work so if there are people out a ways they get used to seeing it come and we make sure people are cared for during those times
8427587 we had a few frantic phone calls this morning to change an appointment or two but outside that this worked for us

8427595 the economic attractiveness of natural gas service has never been greater

8427617 no study has been able to directly link changes in the brain with changes in memory so our study helps to fill in this gap
8427618 although the findings do not change overall debate on the use of estrogen therapy to reduce age related cognitive decline our study illustrates that specific molecules may be identified that are critical to estrogens ability to modulate memory
8427619 therefore it may be possible to design drugs to target these molecules and directly affect memory and since such drugs would not be hormones they could produce the beneficial effects of estrogen treatment without the side effects of current hormone therapy

8427622 its very much a family event and of course artsplash there are over 80 artists coming its a juried art show so we have already selected the very best artists in a number of different categories
8427623 its exciting to me because a lot of people have seen a little bit of my work ive had some at coffee works and the art center but its the first time ill bring together close to 35 separate pieces

8427706 through our relationship with andy we are able to leverage our proprietary manufacturing systems and online tools to produce skateboards on demand with extraordinary quality
8427707 skateboard graphics were one of the main things that inspired me to become an artist so it goes without saying that i want my art to translate beautifully on skateboards

8427717 we remember him as a very handsome and lovely boy it was a joy to have him around
8427718 we are all proud of him he has saved thousands of lives both at the school and in the residential area
8427719 when we served the notice 70 per cent among the 4 8 lakh establishments had already provided for their nameplates in marathi we hope that the remaining 30 per cent have also abided by the norms

8427722 it is not as though he was stealing colonel sanders secret recipe
8427723 m amp s is supposed to be a british institution which treats people decently
8427724 why this heavy handed attitude to someone who has simply exposed widely held views more publicly
8427725 in postwar america friedmans market fundamentalism was regarded as lunatic fringe stuff
8427726 the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences
8427727 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot

8427757 if the operation of the property is businesslike and more characteristic of a place of commerce than a facility used primarily for religious purposes the property is not exempt from taxation
8427758 in 2002 more than 99 99 percent of provena covenants patients entered into contracts to pay for their medical treatment
8427759 almost all of covenants 115 million in revenue came from insurance companies persons paying for their own treatment and other contractual sources provena cannot prevail in its attempt to exempt itself from real estate taxation
8427760 this is our last chance before the vote and we really dont know how that vote is going to go
8427761 mr terenzini has said to us that he wants the privatisation to go ahead
8427762 our message is that he should heed the lesson of the sale of other public assets
8427763 the government will make a short term gain but in the long run when services fail when the private sector cant make a profit taxpayers money will have to buy it back again
8427764 the two words that kept coming up about the art gallery were inspiration and imagination
8427765 it was so successful and people were so giving in what they gave us in terms of feedback comments and ideas
8427766 i guess theres an understanding that some will happen now and that throws the baton over to us now to come through with what it is people are asking for
8427767 were looking at bring the archibald and art express to maitland
8427768 in terms of exhibitions a lot of people want to see more local art
8427769 we do show local art but we dont sell it as local art we need to look at ways to make people realise that the artists are actually local
8427770 one of the main developments to come out of the conversations looks to be an indigenous focus group
8427771 most people were happy with the education and really excited by the new spaces that were going to have in the gallery
8427772 we were looking at mentorships like having exhibitions curated by young people
8427773 so that will bring people in to actually understand the art gallery system
8427774 its interesting that the gallery can be seen as a place of inspiration and imagination and as a safe place too
8427775 i couldnt believe how many people were willing to give up their time to help us in this and im really grateful for that
8427776 weve never done it before but this wont we the last time
8427777 i sat in on every single one of the conversations and listened to what everyone was saying
8427778 you dont make your firmware out of thin air it must contain your key
8427779 scots who like his confident and ebullient approach to leadership would be shocked to see how readily that becomes graceless bluster and bullying
8427780 attacking opponents by coining nicknames for them is a childish tactic more suited to the playground than a parliament to pretend to read from his manifesto and change the wording to pretend a promise was never made is to treat that parliament with contempt
8427781 perhaps the strangest of mr salmonds juvenile jibes came when he responded to a book he did not like by pointing out that scotlands patron saint was real while englands was only a myth perhaps he was joking but it sounded like my dad is bigger than your dad
8427782 we should confront the first ministers playground politics and confound him on the serious ground
8427783 the labour party are past masters at political insults usually directed at each other
8427784 he should try telling us something about himself and the labour party for a change rather than continually obsessing about the snp
8427785 mr gray has just confirmed that labour are now nothing more than the anti snp party with nothing positive to say no wonder they are trailing us by 19 points in the polls
8427786 we need to think before we speak and plan and act before we commit ourselves too deeply beyond the range and strength of our power
8427787 there is a very strong case for a bigger army and this will sound like a fudge but it isnt meant to be what we need is a defence review based on our national security not on treasury guidelines and that will tell us either that we need to reduce the commitments that we have or we need to increase spending
8427788 belly out hands in his pockets constant references to classical mythology
8427789 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action
8427790 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8427791 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8427792 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8427793 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8427794 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8427795 there is a danger of having your cake and eating it of saying that you want a tough response to russian aggression you want to build a strong coalition but then ruling out so many of the potential items
8427796 having russia as a member of the g8 at a time when her troops are still on the sovereign soil of another country i think is inappropriate
8427797 this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8427798 victorias 79 municipalities will be able to spend these funds on a range of priorities including local roads parks and pools libraries community centres health and childcare services

8427828 we make sure we keep our locker room clean and our janitorial staff does an excellent job the floor is clean and everything off of it and they do a really great job
8427829 so when you have athletes such as football players wrestlers al ot of close contact and often very rough contact it can develop for breaks in the skin and thats another opportunity for the bacteria to enter the skin and pose a problem
8427830 if you catch it too late some bad things can happen so we take every bump as seriously as possible
8427831 part of the concern is it will spread beyond the skin so i think being careful and responding early are two very good ways to mitigate the problems

8427843 people look forward to experiencing the best of local foods music theatre and destinations when abroad being able to speak the local language means these experiences are much easier to enjoy
8427844 french is actually an ideal second language for australians travelling abroad
8427845 apart from french being useful in europe canada the caribbean vietnam and africa there are also a number of french speaking destinations closer to home such as the south pacific islands of tahiti and new caledonia these islands which are within a few hours travel time from australia make for exotic mini break destinations or a family holiday

8427849 if the centre wants it should take over inquiry of all the blasts that have taken place in up we will refer all of them to the cbi but we will not allow the cbi to probe one hand picked incident
8427850 there have been several blasts in up since my government took over and earlier during the samajwadi party regime too but the centre never asked for a cbi inquiry into any of them but in this case since the organisation involved is affiliated with the bjp the centre wants a cbi inquiry
8427851 i cant believe the ses or anybody didnt find her sooner

8427855 eighty per cent of despondent people will be found within 2km of home lost person behaviour states they go to a favourite location or somewhere scenic to think all those places were checked immediately
8427856 we like to think its about a bombshell going off in each characters life as opposed to it being about bombshells

8427858 i just hope men dont come along thinking its all about bombshells you know gorgeous women
8427859 this bill will just put the project back in limbo again

8427896 the board is focused on how to maximise the value for the company and for its shareholders and we have been out to talk to other parties to see whether there is interest there
8427897 i am not really at liberty to say where we are in that process but it is something that we would continue to do with a view to getting to a more realistic value for tns
8427898 we just believe that the underlying value of this business is more than what has been put on the table
8427899 we will be spending the next few weeks going and talking to our shareholders both the hedge funds and long term holders both to gauge their position but also to put forward the arguments why we believe wpp should be paying more
8427900 it would be disappointing to see shareholders sell to wpp at this price because there is so much more value that can be delivered

8427911 he is very ambitious and knows exactly how many beans make four when it comes to banking
8427912 hester is a bit young to be chairman and british land are unlikely to let him go to be chief executive
8427913 from an rbs point of view hes a nice answer to the people who question succession planning
8427914 this move by rbs is too little too late but a step in the right direction for upgrading the board and providing credibility for the long overdue ceo search ryan and mcfarlane know their banking

8427918 i love their honesty and their willingness to learn when they learn something new they get bright eyed and you can see it in their faces
8427919 the sooner we get children into a program like this the greater chance they have for success

8427936 despite the money saving aspect of operating remote police drones instead of manned helicopters extending the network of cctv cameras to include the putting them in the sky could well become an invasion of privacy and a big step towards a big brother culture this technology will require strict controls to ensure that it can only be used for specific tasks such as monitoring illegal immigration at sea or photographing crime scenes from the air rather than a means to monitor the population generally whilst cctv currently only covers public areas and private premises its potential expansion to cover anywhere at any time is an alarming thought and is no substitute for more police officers on the beat

8428016 she wants to do something in memory of jye and both maitland city council and i have been advising her about running a skateboard competition

8428034 well hes thrusting himself in my face right now trying to distract me
8428035 but they are all about loss and exit events that happened with me or in my family that type of thing i wanted the album to have a common thread the songs have a similar vibe and emotion but not the same sound its easier for people to enjoy the melancholy rollercoaster ride ups and downs if it sounds like it belongs together
8428036 i pretty much stick with a simple melody and simple lyrics
8428037 the strongest songs are often really simple i start with something i want to say and go right to how can i sum this up sometimes i have hidden messages but its not usually a mystery this is how i feel this is what i want to say when i cant find the right words or if i feel it will sound cheesy or bad im less direct but i think simplicity has a lot of impact and words that impact me today may have an impact on someone else tomorrow
8428038 i think its a craft to tell a story and get people to share something in return
8428039 i go off a lot sometimes talk about the song or throw out these general topics and ask if anyones been affected by the same things it kind of turns it into a big relating experience
8428040 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8428041 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8428042 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8428043 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8428044 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8428051 the laperriere decision provides the basis for an even further shift in favor of control person defendants under laperriere control person defendants inevitably will avoid joint and several liability for the entirety of plaintiffs damages and may even be held responsible for a lesser amount of damages than that attributed by the fact finder to the persons they control
8428052 the most interesting legal aspect of these settlements and buyback programs may be their debilitating impact on the numerous class actions and other private suits filed since the market seized up most problematic for any private suit including putative class actions is the inability to prove damages a central element of any private action if all auction dealers ultimately agree to implement their own buyback programs for customers then all those potential plaintiffs will have no remaining damages

8428059 hes the right age and he comes from madrid so he understands what a big club is all about
8428060 what were doing is supporting scolari he wants to change and move the style a bit and is confident about the players ability and mentality and that he will fit in and make an impact
8428061 you have to look at things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8428062 we knew it could be difficult and from the first minute they played well we needed to work extremely hard until the very end for me the most positive thing was that we played much better than we have done recently against a good team that looked really sharp
8428063 we knew this tie might finish with penalties but we showed the confidence to keep pushing forwards
8428064 pepe reina was clearly the key player in the first leg but i dont think you can talk about just one player tonight all the players worked hard to get us through standard li ge were sharp well organised and in these kind of games you know these teams are only training and thinking about this one game we have had to train without our olympic players we had the international break and we had to use players who are not ready but now we can start working again for the group stage
8428065 in two 90 minute games against liverpool they didnt score and in two 90 minute games against my friend mourinhos team liverpool didnt score but we both suffered
8428066 it is the mourinho story over again and so i think i should call him
8428067 i am very sad because we played so well and we deserved to go through we were very well organised in both games we didnt see the real liverpool in these two games but the team with the most luck and the biggest name won the tie not the best team we had a lot of good situations especially in the first half but we couldnt score we had a very big guy in reina in front of us and congratulations to him but my players are sitting in the dressing room trying to find the answers for how we lost this game
8428068 my hunger to play international cricket is as strong as ever and im determined to force my way back into the side
8428069 i dont think that three weeks away from a job that youve had for five years completely refreshes you but i certainly feel a hell of a lot more relaxed than i did
8428070 i look back on my time in charge with 100 per cent satisfaction for five years i gave more to the captaincy than i could possibly have given and thats why the job took a toll the team needed a new direction and i think kevin pietersen has made a fantastic start
8428071 when you go back in the ranks all you need to focus on is your own game
8428072 we all know about international cricket that is 90 per cent mental he is world class his technique is world class and its just about getting that fresh brain and making the right decisions in the middle we all love watching vaughanie at the top of his form and once we see him hitting the ball well again im sure he will come back in
8428073 this is a band aid but i think you need a bigger picture which is governments issues around the direction of health services in the province because we dont have an adequate home care system
8428074 who actually looks after the patient there do they go back to their family doctor are they looked after by the doctor who looks after patients in that home in that situation it could fragment the patients care
8428075 i note the comments on the newcastle website the contents of which disappoint me because james milner was left with no option in his opinion but to formally ask for a transfer following the clubs total refusal to offer him a new contract
8428076 he was simply asking for an improvement that reflects his development
8428077 having played over 50 games last season and 160 games in the premier league he believed his improvement warranted a new contract it was made clear on two occasions there was not going to be a new contract therefore he felt that he was left with no option
8428078 i knew if i got stuck in i had a good chance
8428079 i wanted to go out there and give it my best shot even when i was 4 2 down in the third set i never thought id lost the match thats just the way i am on court i kept fighting and i knew if i kept hanging on that id get there
8428080 its going to be another tough one shes the olympic gold medallist and not many people can say that but ive got nothing to lose i definitely think ive got a chance in the next round
8428081 its tough in the slams to make sure that you dont do too much in your off days but still you want to stay sharp as well
8428082 doubles is a good way of doing that ideally its nice to play every other day so you get into a rhythm but its different here because you can play monday and then thursday youve got to make sure you stay relaxed but also focused on the tournament
8428083 a player may not play uefa club competition matches for more than one competing club in the course of the same season
8428084 fielded for another club that is currently in the same competition
8428085 if i can find one more player i will take him
8428086 i have never heard so much talked about what a person was paid
8428087 people in england obsess about money i am part of a society here in california where we dont talk about how much money we earn i mean would you tell me what you made well yes that is very straightforward of you but i am not going to tell you what i made it wasnt about the money with me it was about the results
8428088 i think he is going to start to move back up he is a great kid who has had a lot of weight on his shoulders because i was coaching him my goal was to get him in the top 100 but i never claimed to be a magician you can only coach as good as your subject is i cant take some guy who is 100 and make him no1 if the capabilities are not there roddick had the capabilities so did agassi alex has the capabilities to be a top 75 player but he doesnt have the capabilities of being a top five and it is unfair of him to be judged for that he should be a no75 guy and i am confident he can get to that level
8428089 he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots stop playing what i call possum tennis he likes to get on the ropes but he is the kind of fighter who has the capability to get into the centre of the ring and throw blows if he plays more like that then great things are going to happen because he has great talent
8428090 i got sacked i got a call from the lta to say he wanted to go in another direction
8428091 people expect me to be bitter im not look around and youll see how many coaches get fired we still speak
8428092 for a young guy he appears to be older than he is because he is very driven and is pretty reserved he doesnt live an outlandish life and he has gotta be the only scottish guy ever who doesnt drink his idea of a great time is studying his opponents play on dvds and then he plays video games seven hours a day so if he is not playing video games or playing tennis he is with his girlfriend he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games
8428093 possibly the biggest thing with agassi was i knew him for years before i coached him we were contemporaries we were mates before we started the day i started with andy i didnt know him at all there was a big age difference and a culture difference it was the first time i had coached a non american
8428094 andy is very argumentative if he feels strongly about something a lot of people on his team gave into him i didnt so we would argue over sports mostly
8428095 it was like we went to dinner and then it was on to the next match that was when i knew he had a chance to be a great player
8428096 im probably leaning towards going back into television that was what i was doing before the lta came along
8428097 but im in no rush i dont worry about stuff right now im spending time with my kids im here in california im having fun
8428098 to minimize dust entering the camera through the lens mount
8428099 we are investigating their liability on grounds of gross negligence we will base our investigation not only on findings of the bmi but we will also most likely hold hearings and get testimonies of pcg officers and officials involved
8428100 we have heard that they bmi have wrapped up their work on this and it is due for submission to the op office of the president
8428101 any executive decision must have a course of action that would improve the seaworthiness of any vessel making sure that safety systems are in place and lives are protected
8428102 the comelec gravely erred in failing to resolve the conflict between sections 79 and 80 in favor of section 80 of the election code inviting unscrupulous politicians to circumvent the prohibition against premature campaigning by filing his or her certificate of candidacy on the last day before the start of the campaign period to avoid prosecution
8428103 an act designed to promote the election or defeat of a particular candidate or candidates
8428104 any person whether or not a voter or a candidate
8428105 under the equal protection clause our constitution prohibits a statute to favor one class of candidates those who have the influence and money over another class those who do not have the same influence and money to engage in premature political advertising
8428106 no budget springs out of a vacuum this one is shaped by the food and fuel price hikes as it erects ramparts to protect the people while at the same time building up their capabilities for growth and prosperity
8428107 jettisoned our timetable to balance the budget this year in submitting the proposed gaa
8428108 like in the past the 2009 budget is a catalogue of rebates for the tax payments of our people but next year the dividends will be bigger
8428109 as to the vat we are instituting a 100 percent plowback policy meaning all receipts from this tax estimated at p111 billion next year will be funneled to a verifiable spending menu called hearts for health education agriculture roads technology and tourism shelter and security
8428110 the need to provide the vulnerable social protection takes precedence over the satisfaction of turning in a balanced budget scorecard
8428111 for da and afma we are increasing their budget by 62 percent from p22 1 billion this year to p35 8 billion next year
8428112 bringing the latter to p168 billion next year enough to fill its shopping cart with new books more teachers additional classrooms and even breakfast packs for kids
8428113 but of all the agencies it is the department of social welfare and development dswd that will receive the biggest funding hike by 117 percent or from this years level of p4 8 billion to p10 5 billion next year as welfare armor
8428114 by agency we are increasing the budget of dswd by 117 percent of da afma agriculture and fisheries modernization act by 56 percent and doh by 37 percent
8428115 social services allocation spending the bellwether of any social payback drive is increased from p377 5 billion to p434 billion
8428116 this is a first for me in my eight years of financial crimes of white collar for the state police
8428117 tires for vehicles just personal things that didnt really apply to the survival of her family
8428118 people who commit financial crimes usually it starts with borrowing money they have access to like this individual did and then it gets out of hand they go back to that source and back to that source they might pay it back they might not then the mentality changes that their employer owes them
8428119 where do we go now vai pra c vai pra l n o sei pra onde vai sweet child omine a doce crian a de mim mesmo
8428120 the objective is to account for those who perpetrated the atrocities
8428121 the military follows orders but so far we have no orders yet so we will base our movements there
8428122 theres no letup i hope it would be over before ramadan starts
8428123 at the moment there are no continuous exchanges unlike the initial contact but as of the moment we have not received reports of intense fighting although the operations continue
8428124 the fighting resulted in the killings of almost 20 civilians that had not been covered by the media
8428125 the justifications on both sides of this armed conflict do not change the obligation to protect civilians and non combatants
8428126 while our armed forces are doing their best to protect the people other political leaders should prevent further escalation of violence which leaves mostly civilians including children as victims
8428127 this government cannot condone the criminal terror being unleashed by a handful out to sabotage the path to a lasting peace

8428131 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium
8428132 with the assistance of myspace the solar recharging stations are designed to not only raise awareness of alternative energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also to encourage a sense of community both online and offline
8428133 desde el primer d a de gesti n la presidenta cristina nos instruy para que trabajemos en la entrega de dni en un tiempo razonable por eso empezamos todo un proceso de transformaci n y modernizaci n de los registros de las personas
8428134 estamos trabajando en la construcci n del centro de documentaci n r pida que va a permitir que un ciudadano de cualquier provincia argentina haga los tr mites para solicitar su dni en unos 15 20 minutos
8428135 estamos trabajando de ac a fin de a o por un compromiso con las provincias para que el retraso que tiene la entrega de documentos en el rep blica argentina sea saldado
8428136 lastimosamente nuestra provincia no tiene una pol tica de deportes por eso present este proyecto de ley en rasgos generales se basa impulsar a la actividad deportiva desde las escuelas en los barrios en la detecci n de talentos en el trabajo de los profesores todo esto en todas las disciplinas individuales y de equipos
8428137 creo que todos los miembros de la c mara entienden la necesidad de una ley provincial de deportes pienso que tenemos una oportunidad muy importante para fomentar todas las disciplinas entre los m s j venes por eso espero que no se tarde mucho en aprobarla

8428148 es un trabajo especial no hay muchas personas que lo hacen
8428149 un hombre bien vestido me dijo no hagas nada sub al auto donde hab a un joven vestido con una chomba clarita adem s ten a el cabello con reflejos y tambi n estaba una mujer morocha con cabellos ondulados
8428150 actuaba con total tranquilidad no hablaba y hasta parec a que me estaba acompa ando

8428154 integrar el plantel ya era un sue o cumplido el haber jugado como titular los cotejos decisivos y terminar con la valla invicta fue una situaci n inesperada
8428155 cuando volv mis compa eros y los dirigentes del club me felicitaron me recibieron muy bien en el plantel donde tengo dos compa eros que integraron la selecci n holandesa pero no los enfrent en mi debut porque uno estaba suspendido y el otro en el banco con ambos intercambi las camisetas
8428156 viv a 50 metros de brasil toda la vida para mi fue una victoria muy especial dada la jerarqu a de los rivales no pod a perder la concentraci n ni un segundo porque lo pod a pagar caro ronaldinho y compa a te pueden hacer un gol desde la mitad de la cancha

8428177 lislam la religion dont lexpansion est la plus rapide aux tats unis
8428178 this is in contrast with etis robust performance in h1 the first half when ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation was held flat we had taken this as reassurance that eti was outperforming the weak on trade beer market but the q3 third quarter data and trading update from july suggest otherwise
8428179 the next day or so could prove key for the uk market to see if this strength is set to continue this month has seen the ftse run out of steam ahead of the 5550 70 area once already and the temptation to book some profits on the back of the past weeks gains could prove too tempting for traders
8428180 it is more important that the group meet its 4bn target from disposals though recent comments from managements have raised doubt that it will
8428181 our sector view is cautious with the risk remaining to the downside net asset values will continue to be written down and earnings per share growth is coming under pressure
8428182 london office vacancy rates are increasing and retail sales volumes are down to recessionary levels in the last cyclical downturn this pushed rents down in both office and retail sectors this will continue to weigh on share price valuations
8428183 in valuing johnston press we believe that the market is overlooking trinitys more diversified revenue base
8428184 fifty per cent of trinitys revenues are derived from circulation versus 25 per cent of johnston and we favour trinitys national regional mix in preference to johnstons pure play regional exposure in the current environment
8428185 i can see how its size might draw attention to itself but this is a one off accounting adjustment that has no implication on cash or the performance of the group at the operating level the group is in profit and that says a lot about the underlying positive performance of the business
8428186 the downturn in advertising is a reflection of the general downturn in the economy particularly when it is property led newspapers cannot buck an economic trend
8428187 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of ireland
8428188 there are some structural things we can do the company achieved a year on year cost reduction of 7 6m in the first half and we have also reduced headcount across the group by about 300 were also building our digital presence digital revenues grew by 52 over the period
8428189 newspapers will remain a very important medium in future eventually the economy will turn
8428190 tu vas parler et me dire pour qui tu travaillles sinon je ten met t clater le ventre
8428191 o mpla o partido que vem demonstrando responsabilidades durante a governa o facto que culmina com o melhoramento das condi es de vida
8428192 foi uma puni o um pouco pesada vamos conversar para saber se entraremos com o recurso
8428193 we would expect us to be ahead of the downward curve though i am not for a minute saying that we are at the bottom we have no visibility in terms of a forward order book
8428194 we can only read the economy and i dont think anybody is expecting an early improvement we are in for a difficult period
8428195 it is part of the future but i believe that print is also a fundamental part of the future
8428196 i do not subscribe to the misguided view that newspapers will disappear and we will all be reading about the news on our blackberries and mobile telephones
8428197 might prove attractive to potential bidders at the current low valuation
8428198 i think the consumer can be well assured that we have taken all precautions to make sure that nothing is contaminated after they buy the product here
8428199 in fact not only arent there any cases reported during this current outbreak but there has been some information circulated recently looking at cases of listeria for the past several years across canada and im happy to report that nunavut has seen no cases in the past several years
8428200 really theres no way just by smelling or looking at the meat that this might contain the bacteria or not
8428201 so really the safest thing to do is dispose of these meats
8428202 we are keeping yukon doctors and nurses in the communities appraised of the recall symptoms to look for how to test for it those sorts of things
8428203 as soon as that goes out its a top priority it should be a top priority for any business and government and so on just to get in there
8428204 i mean were yellowknife how many supermarkets do we have
8428205 this is a band aid but i think you need a bigger picture which is governments issues around the direction of health services in the province because we dont have an adequate home care system
8428206 who actually looks after the patient there do they go back to their family doctor are they looked after by the doctor who looks after patients in that home in that situation it could fragment the patients care
8428207 natural que o ministro diante de tantas informa es e reflex es jur dicas queira estudar o processo em seu gabinete s esta a o cont m 51 volumes nos autos

8428210 de fato o gasto com pessoal est se aproximando de 5 do pib n o fixamos um teto mas posso assegurar que a equipe econ mica est preocupada em n o deixar essas despesas explodir
8428211 desde o primeiro mandato do presidente luiz in cio lula da silva os gastos com o funcionalismo foram bem menores que os registrados anteriormente
8428212 atendemos o que pod amos mas n o vejo a menor necessidade de aumentos salariais para o ano que vem
8428213 were talking about products that are cooked we could try to sterilize everything that we serve to everybody but nobody would want to eat it
8428214 well have to relook at that and the question of deli meats to see if we need to go further in terms of controlling those kind of products in health care facilities
8428215 we dont think we have any cases related to this particular outbreak which is not surprising since vancouver coastal hospitals didnt serve any of the contaminated products that were initially identified
8428216 some of the larger expanded recall products had been distributed but were not so concerned about that
8428217 nossos candidatos n o estavam pedindo votos para o omar de forma ostensiva h apenas um pedido secund rio no final do programa mas isso ocorre em todo o brasil
8428218 the biggest concern from the cfia inspection staff is simply the amount of time now they spend looking at reports and generating reports
8428219 and all of that means time off of the production floor
8428220 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8428221 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8428222 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had
8428223 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot
8428224 im responsible and my butcher is responsible and thats it
8428225 i think in terms of safety we can reduce risk by having fewer hands in the pot
8428226 im responsible and my butcher is responsible and thats it
8428227 bigger establishments maybe have the ability to hire better quality control staff that can be on staff to check whats going on and they also have some pretty incredible refrigeration systems that allow them to quickly cool the meat which does extend its shelf life
8428228 i think that consumers some anyway are saying now look were ready to pay higher prices if we can have something thats of better nutritional value and actually tastes like something
8428229 we face possibly having to close this store because we cant implement their rules
8428230 it will be controlled by large companies such as maple leaf if theres a problem it goes from b c to atlantic canada
8428231 ah non vous vous trompez les mecs la terre a une forme de patate cras e due laccr tion des roches que mon papa a voulu

8428236 its a dollar a minute taylor a dollar a minute
8428237 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states
8428238 barack needs illinoisans to love each other then he needs us to leave our front row seats and go hug ohio go hug michigan go hug florida
8428239 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8428240 when the first paper came out a lot of people were saying maybe this was a special case maybe this is a little weird
8428241 were in a good position ending the season off so we have to come back ready to go and i think were ready to do that
8428242 were going to focus on one game at a time and just try and get better each day
8428243 not so much as looking at us getting back on a roll but just playing good solid basketball were going to worry about ourselves take care of the little things

8428246 the process in selecting a v p is one that john mccain is keeping very close to his chest
8428247 hes a person i have a lot of confidence in i think hes going to do the right thing
8428248 its an honor to have your name mentioned or something like that
8428249 to paraphrase mae west sometimes a vacation is just a vacation hes just on vacation

8428252 now its possible it could be a foundation on which others can build and package and create solutions for a broader audience its going to evolve and others will build on it but right now and for the near future it will be a niche tool for the more skilled user
8428253 there have been a lot of other attempts to do mash up internet explorer 8 has web slices google has a mash up editor yahoo has pipes but they dont allow consumers to manage the flood of content on the web were being inundated with more and more web content so any tools that can help manage and consolidate data from the web is always helpful
8428254 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8428255 the permatang pauh by election is one by election that cannot be interpreted as something that can happen in other constituencies i believe we can still continue the government
8428256 this by election is not just life and death for anwar but also for pkr and pakatan rakyat but for bn its just a seat and which did not belong to it but to pkr before the by election
8428257 im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive
8428258 russias relations with the west plunged to their most critical point in a generation today when the kremlin built on its military rout of georgia by recognising the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states
8428259 declaring that if his decision meant a new cold war then so be it president dmitri medvedev signed a decree conferring russian recognition on georgias two secessionist regions
8428260 tonight medvedev accused washington of shipping arms to georgia under the guise of humanitarian aid
8428261 even though medvedev tasked the russian foreign ministry with drafting treaties on friendship cooperation and mutual assistance with both south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia is almost certainly likely to be subsumed into the russian federation sooner rather than later
8428262 north ossetian president teimuraz mamsurov too has described unification of the ossetian nation within a single territorial entity as righting a historic injustice the appointment last week of russian regional development minister dmitry kozak to oversee post conflict economic reconstruction in south ossetia indicates that moscow will continue to call the shots there
8428263 russia played a trump card in its strategic poker game with the west yesterday by threatening to suspend an agreement allowing nato to take supplies and equipment to afghanistan through russia and central asia
8428264 the agreement was struck at a nato summit in april to provide an alternative supply route to the road between the afghan capital and the pakistani border which has come under attack from militants on both sides of the frontier this year
8428265 zamir kabulov the russian ambassador to afghanistan told the times in an interview that he believed the deal was no longer valid because russia suspended military cooperation with nato last week over its support for georgia
8428266 the first priority of america and europe must be to prevent the kremlin from achieving its strategic objectives in georgia
8428267 the humanitarian supplies the us military is now ferrying to georgia are critically important to the innocent men women and children displaced by the fighting some of whom we saw last week
8428268 any assistance plan must also include the rebuilding of georgias security forces our past aid to the georgian military focused on supporting the light counterterrorism oriented forces that facilitate tbilisis contribution to coalition operations in iraq we avoided giving the types of security aid that could have been used to blunt russias conventional onslaught it is time for that to change
8428269 if the events of the past fortnight in georgia have demonstrated one thing clearly it is that russia will fight if it feels its vital interests under attack in the former soviet union and that the west will not and indeed cannot given its conflicts in iraq and afghanistan
8428270 moscow has reminded nato of the importance of russian goodwill to secure the supply lines of the us nato operation in afghanistan through central asia
8428271 the iranian foreign ministry adopted a decidedly neutral tone when addressing the russian georgian conflict resorting to diplomatic platitudes that countries use when they dont want to commit themselves
8428272 since then iranian officials have uttered nary a word about the conflict
8428273 experts in tehran believe the irans foreign policy establishment is playing a waiting game in the expectation that deepening us russian acrimony will open up new diplomatic avenues that tehran can use to end its international diplomatic isolation

8428297 but after one year at sussex i thought this was my second home they saw the best years of my career and it was quite frustrating for me not to deliver my best this season because of injury my feelings will always be here
8428298 we were not guilty of complacency it was just that our game went to pieces with those two goals leicester scored but we have come out of it with a couple of positives one that we were able to find our game again and two that we learned a lot of lessons without paying the full price
8428299 maybe the result was a bit unfair but after all thats life
8428300 im happy that we gave it a good go and im not going to moan too much

8428318 los chicos que participan en esta competencia son la camada que se viene del tenis argentino veo un muy alto nivel comparado con el resto de los futures de latinoam rica esto favorece porque los jugadores se van potenciando entre s adem s esto hace todo muy parejo lo que es muy bueno
8428319 en argentina hay muchos torneos futures pero lo que falta es un poco m s de challengers se tienen que agregar un para de esos campeonatos para despu s los jugadores participen en uno de la atp esto se tiene que coordinar mejor en nuestro pa s
8428320 hay dos grupos uno es la famosa legi n argentina que va desde un nalbandian hasta un calleri pasando por un jos acasuso y est el segundo conjunto en donde est sergio roitman berlocq diego hartfield dabul creo que hay tenis para rato hay un recambio importante porque el grupo que nos dio tantos logros est entrando en los 29 a os pero ahora aparece un referente como juan mart n del potro y detr s de l aparece otra camada
8428321 creo que va a mantener la constancia para estar entre los cinco mejores del mundo va a depender un poco de su f sico l es un chico que tiene 19 con una altura excesiva as que el trabajo f sico que realice le va a permitir aguantar el ritmo que trae la s per competencia que es estar dentro de los veinte luego entre los diez y posteriormente dentro de los cinco mejores pero lo fundamental es que del potro tiene tenis para ese nivel
8428322 estoy contento porque hasta ahora me va bien por eso espero seguir as a lo largo del campeonato

8428327 not only that we were still using mostly home grown czw guys and the locker room was never tighter czw truly had a family atmosphere from the wrestlers to ring crew to the security guys and even the fans the reception that lord everett devore got showed that czw fans had developed their own unique personality
8428328 every time we had a show at that firehouse they got nervous and didnt realize what a czw show was
8428329 i have no idea why they kept having us back
8428330 we were setting the pace for all the other companies to do what they do

8428353 and i was told not to ask questions they threw me out of sunday school

8428355 you know how we know that the bush administration did not orchestrate 9 11 because it worked

8428381 my exam for sbi clerical staff post was on july 6 2008 but the letter sent by the authorities reached me on july 8 2008 because of the slow service of the post department which resulted in me not being able to give the exam

8428392 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8428393 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8428394 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8428395 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8428396 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8428400 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8428401 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8428402 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8428403 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8428404 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8428405 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8428406 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

8428410 whether or not people have any insurance coverage at all is just the tip of the iceberg
8428411 many people have health insurance that doesnt protect them from high bills or even assure them of care its a serious problem 25 million u s adults are underinsured up from 16 million two years ago
8428412 as that continues to erode one worries we are headed for even lower numbers
8428413 this means we need a comprehensive solution to deal with our fragmented health care delivery system and some guarantee that everyone can get coverage that is it supportable
8428414 in fighting climate change we must look beyond the emissions from our own operations and look closely into the products and services we use and the suppliers we work with i am very pleased that defra is one of the first organisations to participate in this really important pilot project
8428415 i am pleased that the fco through its collaboration with the carbon disclosure project is leading government in the area of gaining a better understanding of the impacts of its expenditure decisions on carbon emissions throughout the supply chain understanding the carbon emissions and policies of our suppliers will help to embed the sustainability agenda within our procurement decision making
8428416 gloucestershire county council is committed to both minimising our own carbon emissions and working with our partners to reduce emissions from the whole county we are pleased to be part if this pioneering initiative to understand the carbon impact of council purchasing we are working with 2 000 of our suppliers to help them understand the impacts of their products and services and so reduce our contribution to further climate change
8428417 the public sector has enormous power to shape new markets through its procurement practices and these organisations are showing the way in the development of a low carbon economy by joining this project the public sector has positioned itself at the cutting edge of this issue and will be learning with the private sector rather than from it

8428426 personally i think dawkins in his written arguments and public utterances incorrectly conflates three phenomena religion as cultural identity supernaturalism and deism theism preaching to the choir is one thing but if youre trying to reach people who arent atheists this conflation is off putting and weakens the development of a convincing argument for non atheists i also think dawkins at some basic level does not grasp the dimensions of the u s political landscape nor does he realize or perhaps he does and he just doesnt care to what extent the creationist controversy is a political battle
8428427 we need to put creationists on the defensive by arguing part of the time on behalf of the utility of evolutionary biology force creationists to defend the morality of their position

8428446 just let me live til voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8428447 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8428448 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8428449 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8428450 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months
8428451 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8428452 i think its a fair reflection that i dropped about 20 spots by missing the cut
8428453 i think it should be very volatile thats what a playoff system should be like youve got to go produce
8428454 its got more players out here playing more players interested at this time of the year its creating a bit of a buzz if players arent exactly happy with the system at the moment no press is bad press something like that people are talking about it and thats the main thing
8428455 i was thinking of going home to scotland probably for 10 days or so over those first two tournaments seeing the family taking a break recharging and coming back
8428456 and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but you know its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
8428457 is it possible that janzen could qualify for the tour championship but still not earn enough money at the end of the year to finish in the top 125 and keep his card
8428458 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8428459 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8428460 in exchange for cooperating with a massive fbi corruption probe
8428461 im called a goblin shark i cant really see myself how do i look
8428462 yeah and when you bite stuff its even worse try to keep that to a minimum
8428463 this shark can only be found in two regions in the world the northern and southern hemispheres
8428464 sadly the specimen in the video died shortly after it was caught and placed in a pressure chamber
8428465 okay thats trippy but why do they call it a goblin shark
8428466 it is still a dumb policy but if its posted and ignored do so at your own risk
8428467 it would not matter if it was posted its an unenforceable policy and in violation of the constitution they so dearly think they are protecting
8428468 using uniformed nypd cops to enforce those same policies changes everything the strong arm tactics employed by the police here constitutes state action
8428469 i have been a yankees fan since mickey mantle was in his prime
8428470 although the yankees are not the government and therefore have the right to restrict free speech on their private property
8428471 while the city originally funded its construction the yankees have since paid back the city
8428472 okay so maybe i did spit on the officer and tell him to go himself and i might have shoved him a little too
8428473 to be here with one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all time
8428474 i dont believe that anybody feels the way i do about you now
8428475 your clothes are cool my clothes are cool lets mix it up
8428476 snake in my ass literally right now theres a snake in my ass
8428477 phalanx2 is installed us cert told in a land on its current activity site
8428478 yes i think they excel in packing people like sardines into crowded trains for more profits
8428479 money flows to me in abundance money flows to me in abundance money flows to me in abundance
8428480 part two how far will the following people go you want to guess which number obstacle the person will fail on stage 1 1 8 the tarzan swing and net climb will count as one stage 2 9 14 stage 3 15 22 final 23 whole stage will count as an obstacle if a person fails in between obstacles the obstacle he she is approaching will be the obstacle they failed on only if they completely clear the obstacle beforehand before falling timing out
8428481 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8428482 we zijn er het hart van in want we waren dicht bij een stunt
8428483 we speelden erg goed en onze organisatie was vlekkeloos helaas heeft de beste ploeg niet gewonnen
8428484 maar ik ben trots op mijn ploeg we zijn naar hier gekomen om te winnen te leren en beter te worden
8428485 we hebben n fout gemaakt en daar kon liverpool van profiteren de ref was ook niet op onze hand maar ik wens liverpool wel nog succes voor het verloop van de champions league
8428486 dit standard verdiende om in de champions league te zitten
8428487 we spelen twee perfecte matchen we spelen ook de perfecte verlengingen tot dat ene gaatje en de bal erin gaat
8428488 dit standard was de evenknie van liverpool over de twee duels bekeken hadden wij zelfs de beste kansen
8428489 dat liverpool niet goed uit de verf kwam was ook onze verdienste
8428490 maar dit is ook een waarschuwing voor de andere belgische teams als we op dit elan doorgaan zal niemand ons kunnen volgen
8428491 standard heeft heel goed gespeeld zoals ze ook in de heenmatch al hadden gedaan ze hebben ons laten werken voor ons champions league ticket
8428492 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8428493 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready to start camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8428494 having him return is great for our franchise and community but also for the game of hockey
8428495 we are excited to be working with rec solar in providing clean energy during the convention
8428496 rec solars vision is to make solar electricity part of the mainstream energy supply to make that shift in paradigm a reality we recognize that we must reach out to the next generation of energy consumers in their preferred online medium
8428497 with the assistance of myspace the solar recharging stations are designed to not only raise awareness of alternative energy sources that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels but also to encourage a sense of community both online and offline
8428498 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8428499 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8428500 with livecommunity six groups has solved the problem of producer consumer interaction
8428501 next08 ha just saw me on a huge monitor twittering along way cool they are showing the next08 hashtag hope it will be on all rooms
8428502 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
8428503 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
8428504 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8428505 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8428506 my dad used to come home and throw baseballs at trespassers
8428507 my son ryan 7 said dad way to tackle that guy
8428508 i wouldve he was going to have to come over me to score that run
8428509 we can get into this funk where were like what are we doing
8428510 thats the biggest part of my job really to make sure everybody is ready to play the next day
8428511 we needed that win hopefully this is a catapult for us in oakland
8428512 huge for him huge for his confidence huge for us
8428513 it didnt matter though i was going to go with him anyway
8428514 i told myself make sure you catch the ball first
8428515 you try to prepare for a short hop or a ball in the dirt but it was in the air the whole way
8428516 i knew it was going to be close hulett ended up trying to go around me which was even better
8428517 if youre talking about maintaining the viability of and prosperity of regional communities you need to have diverse economies and that includes agriculture mining tourism
8428518 councils made a decision based on planning merits and now its up to the court to determine as to whether or not council has made the correct decision in their mind
8428519 i firmly believe council made the right decision now what happens is when theres a challenge to a council decision in the land and environment court council becomes the respondent and has a legal obligation to defend the decision
8428520 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this
8428521 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
8428522 whats not smart is having underperforming schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not even doing anything about it
8428523 what you should measure is if youve got like student populations and you can see one school thats rocketing up the attainment level and the other school thats falling behind then you can go into this school and say whats happening here what are the teachers doing whats the principal doing what are the parents doing thats making a difference
8428524 you can take that best practice to the school thats falling behind
8428525 the real challenge for mr rudd is will he now withhold funding from those state government and non government schools that do not comply
8428526 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8428527 a lot of the women who dropped off the list this year were for job related reasons
8428528 in some cases its simply a matter of the woman still has a powerful position but other women are relatively more powerful and pushed her down and off the list
8428529 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8428530 shes still an incredibly powerful force shes way more powerful than any other female senator
8428531 kevin roberts is one of the worlds most innovative and influential thinkers about corporate branding marketing and customer satisfaction
8428532 telecom is one of new zealands most important companies and its transformation story is a compelling one
8428533 it will be a privilege to contribute to the companys governance
8428534 how can we clamp a ban on listening to music in cars music is kind of a lifeline for the men behind the wheels
8428535 but if the driver puts music at this high volume it will be actually be difficult for him to listen to it moreover our traffic policemen do not stand with decibel metres its difficult to keep a watch on cars with very loud music
8428536 radio channels are an important means for us to give out traffic updates
8428537 any person who drives or causes or allows to be driven in any public place or a motor vehicle which violates the standards prescribed in relation to road safety control of noise and air pollution shall be punishable for the first offence with a fine of rs1 000 and for any second or subsequent offence with a fine of rs2 000
8428538 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8428539 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8428540 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8428541 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8428542 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8428543 we will leave denver united my goal is that we win in november
8428544 in kontakt k nstler und k nstlerinnen aus israel und bielefeld
8428545 you wont be laughing when youre falling to the ground
8428546 put on the lord jesus christ he will give you love joy peace and fulfillment
8428547 i would not have known sin except throught the law
8428548 tempestade pode se transformar em um furac o amanh ou na sexta feira
8428549 um l der da oposi o disse que talvez haja muitos poderes por parte do fundo uma abertura para fazer aplica es diversas ent o n s concordamos que poderemos delimitar mais aquilo que o fundo pode fazer
8428550 as d vidas s o mais de natureza de como ser a gest o quais ser o os limites a garantia de que o fundo n o correr riscos acho que s o pondera es razo veis balizadas que devem ser levadas em considera o vamos incorporar aquelas que forem consideradas leg timas
8428551 ele poder comprar deb ntures do bndes pap is emitidos pela institui o para captar dinheiro a sim o banco poder apoiar empresas mas a responsabilidade do bndes
8428552 nesse fundo soberano a for a do ministro da fazenda maior do que do pr prio deus ele o deus da aplica o no fundo portanto n o h como o congresso aprovar uma coisa t o vaga
8428553 a oposi o n o est partindo da posi o de se fazer obstru o ela est partindo de negociar propostas e sugest es portanto eu vejo a possibilidade de que a gente consiga construir uma proposta
8428554 ele foi muito r gido nas suas coloca es ultrapassando o lado jur dico parecia uma quest o quem sabe ideol gica mas respeito o julgamento apenas come ou s o 11 magistrados e n s tivemos apenas um voto
8428555 j disse 500 vezes isso caso o supremo mande n s temos que sair somos obrigados cumprir a lei
8428556 o que n s vimos e que s uma etnia estava representada e a realidade n o essa ainda tenho certeza de que n s podemos fazer uma demarca o que possa representar a maioria das etnias
8428557 ao que tudo indica os produtores mais avantajados economicamente t m isen o fiscal
8428558 sempre que n s temos decis es judiciais n s temos cr ticas normal que haja cr ticas porque sempre h expectativas muitas vezes frustradas
8428559 well if if that it doesnt work out and youre in the mood to be tied up and used for a while i could go for that
8428560 net smart is unique because it combines the strengths of two leading nursing programs with a medical schools department of neurology that is one of the strongest in the nation
8428561 net smart also provides participants with on site validation in the heart of the nations stroke belt where there are more cases of stroke and stroke deaths per year than anywhere else in the united states
8428562 we believe that net smart will be a valuable adjunct to learning that will recruit many advanced practice nurses into key acute stroke leadership roles
8428563 our ongoing commitment to apns places us in a unique position to offer this program and it is our desire to see apn value and visibility increase significantly within the health care community and lay public as a result of our efforts
8428564 the feedback weve received on the program from our current fellows has been incredibly positive
8428565 our fellows have rapidly expanded their knowledge and skills far beyond that of most apns providing care to acute stroke patients it is exciting and rewarding to work with these remarkable new nursing leaders and i am optimistic that each will make significant contributions that dramatically improve the care of our nations acute stroke patients in the coming years
8428566 we wont ever run out of oil just like we never ran out of whales
8428567 when we had to move away from whale oil in the mid 1800s we had no idea what a substitute would be
8428568 but as demand and tight supply drove prices up people became more enterprising and found alternatives and obviously we never ran out of whales
8428569 im very confident well develop substitutes for oil and gas on the supply side and demand will significantly fall but the government has to resist calls for price ceilings for this to work
8428570 if we all paid the real price of using oil then the transition to other energy sources would happen ever faster
8428571 that means market prices should reflect all costs and benefits of using fossil fuel including the environmental costs and some could make a case that there are national security costs as well if oil prices reflected some of these costs then some alternative energy sources would be able to compete with petroleum today
8428572 changing the language of industry setting standards for the protection of indigenous languages in the workplace
8428573 research suggests that absent revitalization efforts 155 of the approximately 175 extant native american languages in the united states will die by the year 2060
8428574 the prognosis for the remaining indigenous languages in other parts of the world is for the most part equally grim
8428575 whats not smart is having under performing schools year after year decade after decade not even measuring it not even recognising its happening and not doing anything about it
8428576 our whole plan is to analyse student population and to compare like schools with like schools
8428577 if you saw differences with outcomes then that is to do with the quality of what is happening with that school
8428578 and youd get the best practice from the highest achieving schools and take it to the schools that were falling behind to make sure every kid got the best education
8428579 we are standing here ready to make extra resources available to the schools that are falling behind but we want to make sure we understand exactly whats going on
8428580 how do you compare two schools to come up with a sort of ranking
8428581 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8428582 men are more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road
8428583 men are more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8428584 insurance premiums usually take gender into account for these very reasons
8428585 men are more likely to be involved in an accident due to overconfident or risky driving and women are more likely to have had difficulty judging distances but are generally more courteous on the road
8428586 lol theres to much sh t going on in your sig
8428587 our association with five submarine cable systems is already in the public domain we cannot confirm anything other than those at this point
8428588 join in the effort to take america back from the republicans
8428589 rocked the house and added that bill clinton who blessed obamas candidacy last night reminded americans of a time when a president actually put people first
8428590 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama clinton said
8428591 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8428592 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world clinton said
8428593 he is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8428594 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8428595 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home he said
8428596 generations from now we will be able to look back
8428597 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
8428598 not just to change america but to change the world
8428599 a girl from the south side of chicago and the son of a single mother from hawaii
8428600 when i was doing shows nobody ever fed me i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny
8428601 i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8428602 i felt like absolute shit as a teenager when i was modelling and all i had around me was people telling me i was right
8428603 habr dos estancias infantiles adicionales que se abrir n una en el instituto de arquitectura y arte y otra para servicio de los trabajadores de la universidad
8428604 tenemos una capacidad para atender a 500 ni os en cada una de los centros ya que aqu los horarios no son permanentes habr ni os que est n una hora dos horas y eso hace que podamos ampliar la oferta de los espacios aqu en el centro
8428605 creo que hab a una gran necesidad de una estancia infantil para que pueda haber un cambio de rol de mujeres cuidadoras de ni os a mujeres que estudian y se realizan y que al mismo tiempo nuestros ni os puedan ser atendidos
8428606 no va ser un centro donde los ni os est n inactivos hay un programa de trabajo para ellos un programa de desarrollo de habilidad es psicomotrices juegos de actividad f sica que les permitir mantenerse activos sin aburrirse
8428607 our quarterback battle is a lot closer than i expected
8428608 well go into the ballgame with a starter the other two guys whoever is not starting jimbo will have a package for them
8428609 i know this hes going to want to see them
8428610 a lot of it will be how these games go along
8428611 we havent been able to practice three out of the last four days because of tropical storm fay were a couple of days behind right now
8428612 crash proof how to profit from the coming economic collapse
8428613 a reforma pol tica a m e de todas as reformas o congresso chegou a discut la o legislativo participava com a sociedade desse di logo mas um personagem estava ausente nessa discuss o o governo a minuta apresentada pelo ministro da justi a a demonstra o de que o governo quer se engajar no projeto de reforma pol tica o que bem vindo
8428614 democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word equality but notice the difference while democracy seeks equality in liberty socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude
8428615 for those democrats who are too young to have a proper appreciation of their partys history
8428616 which likely includes most of senator obamas supporters we direct your attention to a memorable moment in dnc history that shows how the current nominee really is connected to the partys past as much as its future
8428617 we looked very hard at how people really browse the web
8428618 we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8428619 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully
8428620 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running in order to oversee the production process in order to validate that the controls are indeed in place
8428621 its tantamount to if you had a haystack with a needle in it
8428622 you can walk out and take 10 samples of that haystack you likely wont find the needle what adds value is address what caused the needle getting in there in the first place
8428623 with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future
8428624 in the spirit of unity with the goal of unity with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8428625 weve introduced a unique program that will help future business leaders use some of the best practices in sustainability
8428626 weve also created new opportunities for students to learn about how to apply business know how to other exciting fields such as communication and tourism management those students will get great interdisciplinary experience from top experts in other areas of the university as well as from the business school
8428627 we are battening down the hatches it could be six 12 maybe 18 months
8428628 i think the single most important lesson is the speed of reaction slowing land purchases attacking costs hard
8428629 marginal projects will be put on hold as financial pressure on housebuilders intensifies and transaction volumes remain low pushing government housebuilding targets further into the wilderness a rapid policy rethink is vital if 2m homes are to be built by 2016 to achieve government targets
8428630 housebuilding is set to fall below 100 000 over the next year with housing starts already down 25 to reduce the excesses of this boom and bust cycle a more sustainable approach to housebuilding needs to be enacted sooner rather than later
8428631 one of our main goals is to establish traditions in the school of materials
8428632 we want to strengthen our student community to encourage retention and to build bonds that last beyond our years at asu
8428633 he has been a mentor on so many levels and its an honor to serve on the board with him
8428634 has been very instructive and enjoyable election to the status of fellow of asm is one of the highlights of my career it is an honor to be included among such a distinguished group of individuals in the field of materials science and engineering
8428635 while waiting for class one day i mentioned to some graduate students that i was listening to a frightening narrative involving mass disappearances earthquakes firestorms and the general collapse of civilization
8428636 the students recognized the tale immediately one picked up its thread while others joined in and they recited the entire narrative of the apocalypse from the rapture when christians who are saved will be taken bodily into heaven through the great tribulation and on to the glorious appearing when christ will return to establish his thousand year reign on earth
8428637 i want to make rhetoric useful and alive for my colleagues across the country
8428638 a postmillennialist and the driving intellectual force in this movement aims to bring about apocalypse by transforming america into gods earthly kingdom as prophesied in revelation
8428639 families would be expected to take care of their own
8428640 reconstruction also requires that the u s constitution and its attendant body of law be rewritten to conform to biblical law particularly that found in the old testament
8428641 i end with the hope that my readers will find or open many more paths of invention than i have been able to name here
8428642 to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
8428643 i get a feeling that people are trying to become more individual at the moment and buying secondhand clothes is a way to do that
8428644 there has been exposure of certain high street retailers who have not been clean as they should be in their supply base so if you want cheap clothes and a clean conscience then a charity shop is an obvious route
8428645 for shoppers who love the dig and delve experience of shops like tk maxx there is really not much difference in going to a charity shop it is all about enjoying the experience of finding a bargain
8428646 a certain section of consumers are turning their back on fast fashion and like the idea of recycling
8428647 we are not in that place where charity shops used to be where people come to us because they have no money and nowhere else to go we think we are much more attractive as somewhere where you can find unusual interesting and one off pieces of clothing sales are driven by that and we have put a lot of work into getting better quality and interesting donations
8428648 you can get clothing as cheap or cheaper at supermarkets and value shops
8428649 this end of the market should do well when householders are hard up
8428650 but there is a problem in whether we can find enough quality donations
8428651 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8428652 this piqued my interest in molecular biology and after completing two semesters at asu i knew that i had made the right decision
8428653 he helps me learn the procedures that i am not familiar with
8428654 and is teaching me how to analyze the data which is being generated by this project
8428655 currently i am working to determine where on a protein a peptide binds and how this binding location changes with mutations
8428656 we then use a mass spectroscopy device to discover the weight of the bound portion
8428657 this allows us to discover the biding site of a given peptide on a given protein and allows us to examine how the mutations which allow a peptide to bind better chemically improve that binding
8428658 if we can design a peptide that only binds to one protein or even one spot on the protein nearly anything in the body can be targeted by it
8428659 if it can be targeted it can hopefully be destroyed or changed which will aide is fighting disease infection and the like
8428660 conor is a talented student with the ability to analyze and explain unexpected results from complex experiments
8428661 his rapid success in research is providing him an opportunity to be a key part of scientific publications related to the work which will make conor a very strong candidate for graduate school im sure conor has a very successful scientific career ahead of him
8428662 i am interested in anything that involves society and the nature of human interaction
8428663 i really like complex things that grow and adapt to the conditions placed on them and manage to work around those conditions to form unique behaviors
8428664 the goal of each book is to provide law students practitioners paralegals college students and laypeople with the essential elements of legal research in each state
8428665 unlike more bibliographic texts the legal research series books seek to explain concisely both the sources of state law research and the process for conducting legal research effectively
8428666 for their support of all my writing projects from the first book review i wrote at the age of twelve that they lovingly tucked in the pages of a scrapbook to all of my current work

8428674 we assume after threats were made on the weekend that this complaint originates from jenna delich or her supporters though we have not yet seen the complaint submitted we assume it runs along the lines that pointing out that ms delich linked to the website of a known neo nazi figure and former ku klux klan leader is defamatory

8428690 basically there is a transition period where you know that things are going to be a little touch and go and there probably should have been more resources put into the program at least until there had been enough time to see how it worked
8428691 so it means they dont get to go to the place where they know there is the highest risk in plant for instance unless it happens to be on that schedule for the day
8428692 it worries me that inspectors are reporting that they dont have the comfort level they once had

8428728 agribusiness firms are already spending millions to defeat proposition 2 and they hardly needed an illegal infusion of check off funds authorized by the usda to supplement their political campaign
8428729 expending these funds within 90 days of the election is a transparent attempt to influence the vote on proposition 2 the egg industry and usda had 49 other states in which to spend this money but it chose to do so in california right before the election and thats unethical and illegal

8428756 we can have an impact if we can get out there to the ranchers
8428757 we want 10 000 deer a year at each of the plants 5 million meals per year for each plant
8428758 if theyve got a program that will feed the hungry were interested in them

8428775 these constitute strategic systems for the pla and they are investing a great deal of effort in modernizing them
8428776 as the administration is seeking to enter into wider and deeper cooperation in space and missiles with china lets not forget that china has consistently refused to join regimes of civilized behavior in the strategic nuclear arena
8428777 they have produced great big nuclear warheads for those missiles and the only feasible use is to destroy a big city what they have built are city busters that are targeted on major american cities

8428821 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8428822 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8428823 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8428858 my personal belief is that homosexuality has little to do with either the actions or inactions of the opposite gender

8428890 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8428891 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection
8428892 to slip through a rule that may have a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers
8428893 but now they will stop at nothing to rush through significant regulatory changes that are detrimental to average americans
8428894 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services

8428927 gold and currencies backed by gold became the foundation of our international credit
8428928 we can only tell what the true strength of the pound is and other countries can only tell it by knowing the amount of valuta we have behind our currency
8428929 we now have 21 billion worth of refined uranium and plutonium
8428930 this has great future value as a source of power

8428932 the sinister goldfinger ably assisted by pussy galore plotted to steal the american gold supply from fort knox
8428933 the movie of 1964 added an interesting twist to the books improbable scenario goldfinger tells agent 007 that he does not have to remove the gold physically instead he only needs to get inside fort knox and install a timed nuclear device supplied by the peoples republic of china
8428934 the bomb would irradiate all the gold inside the building and make it unusable international liquidity would seize up and the western trade and monetary systems would collapse
8428935 only when the tide goes out do you discover whos been swimming naked
8428936 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8428937 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
8428938 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
8428939 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

8428941 playing in a little recession on average troughs go down 25
8428942 are you talking about the possibility that we can actually test the 2002 lows
8428943 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8428944 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8428945 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8428946 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8428947 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8428948 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8428949 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8428950 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8428951 no matter whwere we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8428952 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8428956 we believe the grievance is entirely without merit the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8428957 arbitrators you dont have standing to review this claim but even if you did boras is a known prevaricator of the first water and hes just trying to save face cause huntington smoked him and he has a conflict of interest since his kc client would also be affected by any ruling you give so his testimony is twice problematic
8428958 we look forward to working together with both osc and iiroc to ensure that alpha atss operations will provide new and innovative execution options which will provide additional efficiencies to canadas investment industry and will be of benefit to the industry the investors and the issuers
8428959 i think the view is that it seems less likely cibc is going to have to issue equity
8428960 where i disagree is the notion that the subprime charges are declining
8428961 the reason theyre not taking subprime charges this quarter is because credit spreads declined as in these monolines are a little bit better
8428962 these monolines are in process of coming to agreements with them on ending the coverage when cibc comes to that agreement they will be taking charges
8428963 this is troubling and could indicate additional pressure in future quarters
8428964 we are terminating or reducing activities that are inconsistent with our mission and goals or where the rewards do not justify the risk
8428965 it is critical we complete the rebuilding work quickly so were in the best possible position once industry conditions improve
8428966 its another quarter of cibc focusing on the current risk putting out these fires on their balance sheets and not a lot of talk about the longer term growth strategy

8428972 back in my early days everything consisted of what i like to call tuxedo magicians where everyone wore a tuxedo and a nice button up shirt with a vest everybody looked the same
8428973 so when criss angel came out it showed everybody that not all magicians are the same there are different styles different qualities to magicians
8428974 dealing with a deck of cards and looking at peoples faces when i could find their card blindfolded made me enjoy what i do
8428975 i have an illusion right now that im setting up that involves the band journey and their song faithfully its a whole romance piece
8428976 if everything goes according to plan i hope to release it to the public in the next year or so
8428977 im always interested in what other magicians are doing im always seeing whos raising the bar and seeing if there are ways i can create my own bar
8428978 i tried leaving magic for about a year or so when i was 16
8428979 theres a rule that once you do magic youll never leave it its stuck with you forever ill do it until the day i die
8428980 i mean its ridiculous that here we are in tucson the town that gets more sun than any other place in the country and were not exploiting solar energy
8428981 the fashion show is going to show how current fashion reflects vintage

8428984 if nothing else bring them to buffalo sell them get cash or trade or donate them to thrift stores so that it can be reused
8428985 we went to el paso together we found a place where some crazy old woman had 30 000 records stashed in a warehouse so we went and looked through every one of them
8428986 i got those albums on vinyl because it seemed more interesting to me
8428987 its just the original format and it appealed to me because its going out of date and seemed archaic
8428988 the recording is analog to analog on vinyls as opposed to analog to digital transfer which destroys the sound quality
8428989 yeah i think its a deeper richer sound on vinyl
8428990 i think most people who really are into it would know and agree
8428991 its just perseverance and sticking to it because there are lots of places to find records and there is no guarantee that youre ever going to find a good one
8428992 but if you look look look look and never stop youll probably find something
8428993 there are ways to do things that are a little more than luck of the draw but im not about to divulge my secrets
8428994 i was totally surprised it was a really good show
8428995 i was shocked because i go to shows all over the country and it was really really good great crowd i sold a whole bunch of trents stuff i was really pleasantly surprised
8428996 basically its just for that curious person you just never know whos going to come out of the woodwork and become a fan
8428997 ive seen a few people get that little itch they were kind of curious then next thing you know weve created a monster
8428998 i dont know if i could go to a place and not go looking for records i would say until im physically not able to and i dont see that happening

8429083 good quality fish thats caught on their doorstep they dont want something landed by a super trawler thats four weeks old
8429084 ive had a few close calls with the tankers you basically just give way
8429085 tell people youve caught this so close to london and they wont believe you
8429086 but theyve cleaned up the thames so much now that on a sunny day it can be impossible to trawl because the waters so clear the fish see the nets coming over the last 20 years canveys water has gone from category c which is the lowest you can get to category b whitstable is now category a which means you can eat oysters straight from the sea without having to purify them
8429087 i think theres a massive market for this type of fishing the problem is tapping into it as its a lot of work to go trawling in the morning then take the fish to market yourself but its nice to see both sides of things fishing is quite a solitary job and i now get to meet all different sorts of people most customers like the thought that its caught locally and that they know where it comes from there have only been a few whove been concerned about the water quality but once theyve tasted the fish theyve always come back again and again after all its only hours old sometimes so the quality is second to none
8429088 i caught a load of black sea urchins a couple of months ago and we were going down to a market so i thought id put them on the side of the stall for some decoration

8429090 anything that has red cloudy or sunken eyes is not fresh no matter what the fishmonger tells you the eye should look like a healthy dome on the fishs face
8429091 rub your hands down the skin of a freshly landed fish and you should find a layer of clear slime on your hands it should never feel dry or scaly
8429092 open the gill cover and take a look inside the fleshy part should be a healthy red so avoid anything thats either grey or brown
8429093 only old fish has a fishy smell when its fresh a fish will smell of the salty sea even after it has been thoroughly washed
8429094 when a fish comes out of the sea its strong and packed full of energy so should feel hard the longer it stays out of the sea the softer it gets so you can generally tell how old a fish is simply by how it feels
8429095 hold the fish up to the light and see if the skin has an iridescent shine along its side if it does then its fresh

8429098 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8429099 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8429100 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8429101 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8429102 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8429103 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8429104 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8429105 you cant tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued nsls to at amp t and verizon
8429106 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8429107 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8429108 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8429109 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8429110 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8429111 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8429112 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8429113 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8429114 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8429115 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8429116 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8429117 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8429118 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8429119 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8429120 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8429121 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8429122 hun sens plan is to develop roads throughout the northwest and to provide for soldiers and their families serving in the region
8429123 he was a solider so he understands the needs of soldiers and their family members
8429124 the land is ready and were working out the details
8429125 the prime ministers policy will be good for our soldiers and will encourage them to defend the border and our nation against thailand
8429126 its an important step toward improving border security and the safety of the whole kingdom
8429127 its a good idea but commanders will take the best land for themselves while our troops will be left with smaller plots
8429128 i am in contact with provincial authorities regarding the concessions but it is their responsibility to apportion land to military families
8429129 we are working to provide land for landless people in kratie and kampong cham provinces as well as other provinces
8429130 we want to make sure its given to the right people not just military families
8429131 kenenisa and tirunesh were absolutely fantastic in beijing they really deserve such welcoming
8429132 our athletes have placed the country among the elite of countries that excel in athletics
8429133 we as a country and government are very proud of the achievements
8429134 it was a special moment the fans have repaid our success with their enthusiastic welcome
8429135 lets not forget that he had opted out of the marathon due to reasonable reasons and kenenisa had also benefitted from hailes tactics

8429147 now theres a complete five volume set of the medical guide at both the evergreen and conifer libraries as it was included in the last rotary club cipa elf donation to conifer high school jefferson county public library in march
8429148 having current accurate and balanced information in print on our shelves is vital to our collection were grateful for the community partnerships weve developed with groups like the rotary club of conifer and the cipa education and literacy foundation which help strengthen the community as a whole as the economy turns downward the trend is that libraries become busier and therefore its even more important to receive support like this from our local and state beneficent organizations
8429149 as a resident of this community im very appreciative of these donations to our schools and libraries as they help to defray the increasing costs of books allowing our available funds to go further though many believe the internet has reduced demand on libraries the fact is that library usage continues to increase dramatically

8429183 titan prisons would be a huge waste of public money doing nothing to reduce crime or tackle sky high reoffending rates
8429184 the money could be much better spent elsewhere making improvements to the existing prison system and investing in measures to reduce the prison population
8429185 cement this countrys position as the prison capital of western europe
8429186 the proposals ignore evidence that smaller local prisons work better than large ones raise serious concerns about the wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff and would put at risk relationships between prisoners and their families
8429187 no titan prison will be made up of a single vast block holding thousands of prisoners

8429193 just another sign that obama is an iconic figure to the black community
8429194 now paying for tv ads tying obama to violent radical group
8429195 this election needs to become a referendum on mccain and his ties to bush rather than on obamas ability to lead
8429196 if you focus on obama it feeds the obama referendum vibe thats been occurring for a month if you focus only on bush it ignores that bush is not on the ballot this fall if you focus solely on mccains national security credentials well thats a lot tougher than tying bush to mccain
8429197 he should focus on how the bush administration has failed failed and failed again and mccain will take us down the same road
8429198 mccain should be disqualified for wanting the next four years to look like the last eight years
8429199 biden with his knowledge and oratory skills can successfully make americans notice the mccain presidency just means more failed bush policies
8429200 assuming obama does the positive vision on thursday wilmingtons joltin joe biden needs to come out swinging like phillys smoking joe frazier and make clear that the election is about moving forward with obama or a bush third term
8429201 he needs to make clear to the chattering class that he is indeed the happy warrior ready to mix it up and help set the negative johnny mac narrative for the fall
8429202 after the weenie vice presidential candidacies of joe lieberman and john edwards democrats need a vice presidential nominee that takes the fight to the republicans
8429203 the past future contrast makes the case for the younger obama and a fresh way of looking at the emerging challenges of the future and rejecting the failed policies of the past
8429204 globalization especially the increasing connections of our economy with others around the world
8429205 these findings run counter to the widespread assumption that people in the muslim world are anxious and hostile about the prospect of integration into the global economy

8429212 i oppose this proposal on all counts cook is clearly not a football man he is working for a removed by my lawyers with seemingly no remorse and football needs to get back to basics not continue on this tragic path to global obsolescence sooner or later most of us will ditch our premier league clubs out of frustration but not because of the beliefs of the likes of garry cook
8429213 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8429214 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8429215 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8429216 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8429217 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8429218 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8429219 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8429220 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8429226 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8429227 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8429228 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8429229 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

8429233 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8429234 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8429235 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8429236 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8429239 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8429240 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8429241 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

8429326 when we received the draft in 2007 it had no meaning and no real standards for fighting corruption
8429327 the government was planning to set up a supreme council with representatives from across the government but if you have representatives from all sections of government how can you deal with government corruption
8429328 the law has been completed and the opinions of civil society and other stakeholders have been included in the final draft
8429329 we are pleased to hear that the government has announced plans to proceed with the passage of this important law
8429330 we have not had recent conversations with the government on the substance of the draft law but we look forward to seeing a draft of the new law and working with the government in order to pass a version that meets international standards
8429331 its going to save it from going to the landfill its a win win
8429332 i didnt want to get into giving it to employees
8429333 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8429334 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8429335 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of
8429336 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8429337 making mental ill health in prisons an even bigger problem
8429338 it is inevitable that prisoners in huge jails far from home will lose touch with their families and friends and end up leaving prison rootless and unskilled
8429339 the more prisoners there are the more ex convicts you will end up managing this countrys very high reconviction rate shows that prisons are currently failing to rehabilitate convicts while often destroying families and jobs
8429340 titan jails are a bad idea but it would be equally wrong to ignore the state of prison overcrowding we must address this problem and we cannot simply empty our jails of serious or repeat offenders
8429341 the right way forward is to build smaller local prisons with a new focus on reducing re offending and in this way arrest the growth in prisoner numbers
8429342 titan prisons will be a titan nightmare for those communities unfortunate enough to have these massive complexes built on their doorstep
8429343 over the course of the year the communities near titan jails will see thousands of prisoners spat out of the gate with no prospect of sensible and safe resettlement
8429344 quite frankly these are perfect market conditions for the drug trade and will inevitably result in local
8429345 the government is on the verge of making a massive costly and hugely damaging mistake that will destabilise the criminal justice system for years to come said juliet lyon the trusts director
8429346 giant us style prisons may be easier to build but all the evidence here and abroad says the price we would pay in running them and in higher re offending rates is far too high
8429347 we believe that investment in community sentences and in smaller units for those who need to be in custody especially for women and children are better ways of solving the prison crowding problem than building titan prisons
8429348 another day brings another gloomy prediction about the british economy economic incompetence nothing was put aside for a rainy day to help british families cope
8429349 the upshot is that after growth of about 1 2 per cent this year we now expect the uk economy to contract by about 0 2 per cent in 2009 we previously forecast growth of 0 5 per cent
8429350 this projection is well below the latest consensus forecast of 0 9 per cent
8429351 but these developments wont prevent the economy from slowing further over the next year or so
8429352 it is quite plausible that they fall even further than this
8429353 as a result of this new negative data consumer and business surveys consistently show that the fear of an actual recession dominates
8429354 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8429355 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8429356 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8429357 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8429358 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8429359 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8429360 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone

8429362 from an early age i have had the luxury of being able to travel and make music for a living this has always been such an important part of my life so naturally i wanted to give my listeners a peek into the events that have impacted both my life and my career

8429374 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea
8429375 one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has already made on the premier league
8429376 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8429377 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8429378 about a week ago we noticed we had a problem with some of the cats and our vet tech regina she checked over the cats and determined yes they did have ringworm
8429379 weve had to thoroughly clean every room scrub it from top to bottom
8429380 all the bedding all the towels all the cans of food bags of food have to be wiped down individually
8429381 they havent had their usual romps and walks and training sessions and theyre exhibiting signs of stress they know something is different
8429382 we cant take in any animals because of it and its just really stressful for everybody
8429383 once we have a good air filtration system and were able to have a real isolation unit where we can isolate animals that have problems like this then that will certainly solve our problem
8429384 what it really shows to us is a real need for foster homes and thats what we desperately need now
8429385 they graduate and then what happens they cant find a job and end up moving either south or west or wherever to find a better job and thats just really tragic and something we really need to change here in central new york
8429386 and i loved reading new music on the page i read it as i read novels all my pocket money went on scores first it was beethovens string quartets then boulezs second sonata then increasingly complex works
8429387 they decided to make me their adoptive son i toured with them and turned pages for them his musical language became my mother tongue even more than that of bach and mozart but unlike beethoven who welds all his elements into a coherent musical argument messiaen piles his elements on top of each other and leaves us to make what sense we can
8429388 i want to share my love of it and let it shine
8429389 they say he lives within us they say for me he died and now i hear his footsteps almost every night

8429416 jesus proclaimed the sacredness of human life throughout his teaching and ministry in a roman world where abortion was commonplace the church proclaimed its intrinsic moral evil the didache perhaps the earliest known christian manual of moral teaching dating from the first century rejected abortion early church councils considered it one of the most serious crimes that teaching has remained constant and unaltered for two millennia
8429417 all other rights are useless if one is denied the right to live
8429418 formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense the church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life
8429419 those who are excommunicated and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion

8429426 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
8429427 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it here from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here we have what appears to be knowingly committed mortgage fraud
8429428 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done ruins lives destroys neighborhoods and is calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8429429 people generally do not commit real estate or mortgage fraud for the sheer joy of ripping off the system although in lindsey hunters case with all the benefits he receives by virtue of playing in the nba if he did it then that would appear to be the primary motivation
8429430 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8429431 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8429432 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells
8429433 the turnout at the events continues to grow and the number of messages streaming in has been incredible
8429434 wiffiti allows the audience to stay actively involved in the discussion throughout the forums which puts our social media message into practice in a timely engaging way
8429435 the face of politics has changed dramatically throughout this election and emerging media technologies have clearly taken center stage
8429436 the outburst forum at the dnc gave us a chance to showcase wiffitis capabilities for sparking intense debates that extend far beyond the venue itself the forum panelists did an amazing job at propelling the digital conversation forward while still giving the audience control of the dialogue its so rewarding for us to see wiffiti used in this way
8429437 were fortunate to be involved in both the dnc and the rnc the democrats have gotten the majority of the buzz for employing emerging media in their campaigns so were proud to be opening up the social media dialogue to both parties

8429448 he has a groin problem so he will have an operation and could be out for 10 to 15 days it is not serious but we need to do it now
8429449 he has been playing some games in pain not being 100 fit and we decided that this was the best moment for the operation
8429450 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8429451 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved
8429452 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8429453 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8429454 i was delighted that dirk kuyt scored the goal his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8429455 we are very sad after that result over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8429456 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup
8429457 i sometimes wondered whether the referee was effected by the fact that we were playing a big team i felt we should have had a couple of penalties
8429458 its exactly the sort of thing we want to be doing
8429459 i think that if we take this step other universities might be encouraged because they have to keep up with the pack
8429460 they had taken the cars and placed them in an area with the intentions of coming back and getting them at a later time for whatever use we dont know
8429461 they dont need to hot wire people are too accommodating as far as having the keys left in the vehicle or in the ignition where they could see them and then take the vehicle
8429462 id already been looking into licensing records from abroad and id put out a few singles for local bands in the past

8429464 having started with kris and joan reveal to me was about being open to any genre of music
8429465 but as i signed more acts people started telling me how much they liked my new folk label my original distribution was much more geared towards the indie rock market so i approached folk distributor proper last summer and we set up navigator as a separate entity to focus on the folk and acoustic side
8429466 folk wasnt a genre i knew in real depth before meeting kris but ive really thrown myself into it over the last couple of years
8429467 ive always liked learning about different types of music and besides the quality of artists the folk scenes great fun to be around the people are great everythings really relaxed its perhaps more enjoyable than the indie rock business on a day to day basis
8429468 tom used to run a very successful record shop he knows how to sell records
8429469 a lot of people who start record companies have all sorts of big ideas but no real clue about actually making it work hes equally good with the artistic and the pragmatic stuff
8429470 we try and make it as easy as possible for people to cover our stuff
8429471 im pretty disciplined about making sure things happen on time and being up to speed with what different parts of the media need magazine lead times and so on
8429472 we like to think this is how motown felt back in the day only with more fiddle players and without stevie wonder playing at the christmas parties
8429473 the scottish english trio are unique in the folk scene for their self written jigs reels and complex instrumental work and for the way they can repeatedly switch mood and direction within a song

8429496 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8429497 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8429498 we see somebody down and out we care for them
8429499 to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest
8429500 barack obama is the only person in this race who understands that that before we can work on the problems we have to fix our souls our souls are broken in this nation
8429501 america needs positive optimistic leadership to kind of turn this country around to see a revival of our national soul
8429502 polities that attempt to shape the souls of their citizenry and foster certain excellences or moral qualities by penetrating deeply into the private sphere the founders wanted their government to be limited to establishing and securing such a sphere
8429503 the essence is to lead people design is the embodiment of the right information at the right time
8429504 how do we make money is the obvious common language between business and design
8429505 it took me quite a while to understand i learned the hard way
8429506 they narrow the solutions for us and can translate between business and design articulating benefits
8429507 at this point their egos could be through the roof
8429508 but they wanted to understand who we are and work according to that

8429549 why is your teacher eating with the tax collectors and sinners
8429550 it is not those who are healthy who need a physician but those who are sick but go and learn what this means i desire compassion and not sacrifice for i did not come to call the righteous but sinners

8429552 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8429553 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8429554 theres always information coming forth regarding escapes and they told me that they monitor the situation they do due diligence they investigate the actual tips that come in and the intelligence and then they digest it and go from there
8429555 in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8429556 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8429557 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard

8429567 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8429568 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8429569 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8429570 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8429571 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points

8429634 i was like oh somebody is playing on my phone again i hit him back with a bunch of question marks and he hit me back with this is game still i wasnt convinced yet then i started checking my messages and apparently he was on a new york radio morning show and asking if anybody had my phone number and said he was trying to reach out to me so i eventually called him we had a great conversation talked about a lot of things he invited me to come to his show come kick it i took him up on it
8429635 it was more so a joe budden vs g unit thing which at the time game happened to be a part of so i mean it wasnt anything personal between myself and him and it was so many years ago and i think we both grown and gotten past all of that verbal bashing i thought tuesday nights show was great for hip hop
8429636 the picture was more so to say well dead the beef but we dont necessarily need to care for one another the situation last night was totally different he showed me a whole lot of love him and his people it was altogether a great experience i was standing there during the show like a fan dude brought out dana dane kool herc maino who is like family to me rae and ghost i think all these people who i am all cool with were shocked to see me but the energy in the building was great

8429724 it spiralled out of control to the ground where there was an enormous bang it was horrifying to watch a few seconds later a big plume of smoke went up
8429725 its a high residential area and there is a school opposite the address so its very fortunate that no other parties have been affected by this
8429726 we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving this must change
8429727 greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming we should not tolerate underperformance
8429728 the dogs are used elsewhere and we certainly want to be in that space
8429729 we consider the use of a dog just another technique once reasonable suspicion has been established by an officer
8429730 we have been researching worldwide different breeds of dog for that
8429731 we dont have passive sniffing dogs which means when the current dogs react they scratch

8429735 the dogs could help where somebody is on ice in particular and it is very hard to detect if they are on those kinds of substances and when they go off the deep end they do so with such force it is quite frightening
8429736 there are concerns in terms of the rights of individuals

8429740 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8429741 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8429742 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8429743 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8429744 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8429745 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8429751 rev martin luther king jr never settled for a common ground approach to fight racism he sought to win similarly gov casey did not seek to fight abortion by looking for common ground he knew that the common good could only be achieved by protecting the lives of innocent human beings
8429752 moreover when it comes to human trafficking the democratic party platform does not seek common ground it wants strong legislation and enforcement but when it comes to abortion the party jettisons a legal strategy offering instead the tired mantra about achieving common ground
8429753 the casey collapse can only be understood against the forces he must deal with on a constant basis for example the democratic national convention has already been host to the presidents of naral and planned parenthood and yesterday featured an emilys list event
8429754 emilys list is the nations richest pac and it only gives money to abortion rights women candidates for office at its special gathering on tuesday it was able to attract the most radical pro abortion women in america not surprisingly hillary and michelle were there that this is the only venue where those two could ever find common ground speaks volumes it also explains why casey settled for clich s
8429755 he colored on the walls with crayons markers paints rollers and finally an industrial airbrush his mother made him wash off every bit of color if it takes all day if it takes the rest of your life leading murky to his hatred of color as an adult
8429756 the faith community is leading the way with or without government funding
8429757 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8429758 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8429759 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8429760 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8429761 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8429762 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8429763 i propose that we the pro life movement adopt as our next goal the banning of sex selective abortion
8429764 when a son is born let him sleep on the bed clothe him with fine clothes and give him jade to play with when a daughter is born let her sleep on the ground wrap her in common wrappings and give her broken tiles for playthings
8429765 the machines may be intended by the australian government to improve prenatal health care
8429766 but on the ground in china they will be used on search and destroy missions for unborn baby girls
8429767 a vote for obama and biden is a vote to sustain legalized child killing
8429768 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8429769 we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8429770 the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8429771 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8429772 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8429773 the most visible and vocal protestors demonstrating at the democratic national convention are the advocates for the unborn virtually ignored by the media they are everywhere and in the faces of delegates undaunted by the heat the ridicule and the tight restrictions placed on them by the city and ignored by the main stream media these soldiers for life battle on
8429774 theyre out to try and usurp my authority its a war and ive got to win or theyll wind up sociopath killers and itll be all my fault
8429775 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained

8429784 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8429785 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8429786 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8429793 se nota que hay premura en la redacci n de la ley hubo un desconocimiento pleno entre quienes redactaron esta ley la primera observaci n que se tiene es que esta ley en su dise o carece mucho de t cnica legislativa hay disposiciones que son transitorias y la ley no las establece como tal pero lo peor es que esta ley contradice el art culo 61 de la ley tambi n org nica de hidrocarburos
8429794 hay entonces una contradicci n entre dos leyes de un mismo car cter
8429795 aqu lamentablemente pareciera que lo que se quiere es convocar a un paro de transporte de hidrocarburos l quidos nosotros tenemos que tener cuidado con eso tenemos que ser responsables por el pa s no podemos promover un conflicto que paralice el suministro de combustible y colapse el mercado nacional
8429796 el problema no era la deficiencia de transporte de combustible en los tiempos del paro petrolero el transporte de combustible no se par fueron controlados por la guardia nacional

8429800 o ur party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
8429801 the draft of the democratic party platform principally written by obamas senate policy director the estimable karen kornbluh is a remarkably feminist document one befitting of a political party that this year came exceedingly close to nominating a woman
8429802 we know that when america extends its promise to women the result is increased opportunity for families communities and aspiring people everywhere
8429803 women still earn 76 cents for every dollar that a man earns
8429804 t he democratic party has revealed that it thinks people of goodwill cannot believe abortion is wrong it has effectively stated pro life americans need not apply to the democratic party
8429805 could it be that the democratic partys abortion position has become even more extreme than that of the most pro abortion presidential candidate ever
8429806 pro choice a nuance reflected in the language of the platform
8429807 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay
8429808 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programmes for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programmes
8429809 the democratic platform shows that we need to reduce the need for abortion this has always been part of the pro choice movement
8429810 the antiabortion movement is not interested in giving women rights theyre interested in taking them away
8429811 whats important is that women have more choices but keeping abortion safe and legal is as important today as it was in the past
8429812 i simply dont see this as a modification of the partys pro choice stance rather its a strengthening of that position
8429813 the language in this platform reaffirms in the strongest of terms the democratic partys solid commitment to a womans right to choose as defined by roe v wade
8429814 joe biden is a good example of the type of catholic voters that are out there

8429825 jazz has been the active ingredient in every kind of joyful gathering
8429826 the big news isnt that daily newspapers arent hiring women as critics its that many of them have ceased caring whether they have a full time movie critic at all
8429827 dont trouble me as much as the pervasiveness of the idea that critics the last line of defense between moviegoers and studio generated hype no longer matter
8429828 was so laughably low the editor who interviewed me made no secret that the paper wanted to hire a female critic but clearly what the joint really wanted was a cheap date
8429829 we knew we wanted the drums to be a bigger drum sound and a real drum sound
8429830 we wanted the guitars to be bigger than they had in the past
8429831 we knew we had alex skolnick and greg christian on the record and we wanted to do it right
8429832 we went back to our old style of writing when those guys were in the band it has the old feeling and sense of the other albums

8429836 this is probably as close to a spiritual show as well ever do
8429837 it is very uplifting but its certainly not fluff its got a lot of meat in it a lot of hope
8429838 but it wont feel like youve been hit over the head by up with people
8429839 this is a fully staged and choreographed production although all the characters are not completely fleshed out
8429840 their stories are left open to personal interpretation and a lot of that interpretation is left in the hands of the actors
8429841 so we wanted to give the audience its own set of crayons so they can add their own colors anybody in the audience can believe what they want or what they need to believe
8429842 a series of songs all connected by theme rather than narrative
8429843 the first song in the show is set in 1492 but then in the next scene the year is 1996
8429844 another sequence begins in 1775 it includes three women representing different periods from history talking about their desperation with always trying to mend things back together
8429845 the common thread for each song is that it will begin one way then take the audience for a loop

8429852 it was a whole new approach with this record because the songs are shaped more so you have to hear the entire album before making conclusions
8429853 i think america has such bad add these days when it comes to art and entertainment and attention spans have gone down to zero this record was an attempt to give the feeling i had growing up listening to an album until the music rubbed off the disc making an honest connection with it
8429854 m lange of content old and new living and supernatural holy and profane
8429855 an important part is to just be open to whatever happens
8429856 to me its a lot like working with found art id never be happy with just an ordinary jam session
8429857 it has to have a certain aesthetic standard right away i knew the playing had to be consistently high so the music wouldnt become just a random thing
8429858 but with a jam session you never know when its natural life will end i always feel honored that people still keep showing up
8429859 theres a strong circle of friends who show up every sunday
8429860 it was because of pete and the jam sessions that weve all become such great friends
8429861 among the musicians i always want to be aware of their unofficial rank in the community
8429862 those who have paid their dues always get my respect especially the older players its like a boxer who has been a great boxer it is important for us to honor what they achieved in the past
8429863 the hardest to deal with are the ones who cant play as well as they think they can explaining that to them can be very tough

8429874 i cannot wait to see barack obama sign into law a healthcare plan that covers every single american
8429875 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team
8429876 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
8429877 but right now i feel like theres so many aspects of our great nation which could use a little bit of help or a lotta bit of help that its hard to pick just one
8429878 i think the most important thing is the economy we need to figure out the housing crisis we need to build up our middle class again right now the disparity between the uber rich and the uber poor its worrying and its not getting better we need to focus on a way to just get our economy back to get it back on track

8429887 ugh i hate it and i hate you for foisting this on me
8429888 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8429889 acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is
8429890 it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that binds us all into one human family
8429891 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community
8429892 the connection between abortion and racism is that certain people are somehow not fully human like racism abortion allows us to treat people inhumanely if it makes our lives easier and like racism abortion provides a sense of justification for actions we know in our hearts are wrong
8429893 the unborn are obviously easier to discriminate against than any group of born humans they cannot march they cannot protest they are invisible
8429894 we want to commend those men and women and say that life is a civil right life is precious and that it transcends politics
8429895 democracy cannot last long when we deem some people unworthy of life
8429896 what is the proportionate evil being prevented by voting for obama that can possibly outweigh abortion
8429897 in the name of what justice is the most unjust of discriminations practiced some individuals are held to be deserving of defense and others are denied that dignity when this happens the process leading to the breakdown of a genuinely human co existence and the disintegration of the state itself has already begun
8429898 n ot all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia for example if a catholic were to be at odds with the holy father on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive holy communion there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
8429899 we cannot solve all the problems in the world but let us never bring in the worst problem of all and that is to destroy love this is what happens when we tell people to practice contraception and abortion
8429900 the inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

8429904 somehow gotten into the container which caused it to have an exothermic reaction or self heat and emit gas
8429905 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8429906 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8429907 i have been asked to inform you that senator obama accepts the nomination
8429908 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8429909 that makes two of us barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8429910 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8429911 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8429912 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8429913 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8429914 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8429915 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8429916 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8429917 in the five days since being unveiled as barack obamas running mate delaware senator joe biden has been somewhat of a forgotten man in all the hoopla surrounding the democratic convention
8429918 that changed tonight as biden took his turn in the spotlight formally accepting his partys vice presidential nomination and serving notice that hes ready and willing to take the fight to the republican ticket this fall
8429919 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8429920 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8429921 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8429922 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8429923 the clinton and obama camps orchestrated a roll call that pleased most everyone upset almost no one and provided an historic moment for the nightly newscasts
8429924 it was another attempt by the party to show a united front coming out of this convention something that looks more possible by the day
8429925 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8429926 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
