6890064 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6890065 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6890066 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6890067 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6890068 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6890069 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6890070 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6890071 the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event

6890239 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
6890240 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
6890241 christmas of 1971 was centered around scripture that john had gotten from the first bible we had been able to get from the vietnamese
6890242 john composed an extremely compelling sermon that night about the importance of christmas i think it was certainly a shot to everyones morale to hear those christian words in that very un christianlike place

6890251 that took me to the other side the guy with the beard the director who would sacrifice everything to make the movie
6890252 i knew that i wasnt having lunch with limp bizkit fred durst
6890253 but i was a first time director and it was too big of a budget
6890254 when everyone else around me was telling me to milk the music thing fincher gave me an ultimatum
6890255 its not a coincidence that cube vision works with a lot of first time directors instead of with guys set in their ways who dont want to compromise
6890256 we still want to make the kind of movies we want to make
6890257 i trusted that we wanted to make the same movie

6890364 o2 have been renowned for innovation over the years with the creation and development of the xda series of machines twelve months or so ago o2 launched what was arguably the best xda machine the xda orbit this developed a massive following despite it having a few shortcomings such as too fast a trackball and a relatively slow operational speed o2 have now launched the replacement for the orbit which has been imaginatively named the xda orbit 2 this is again based on a generic htc design the polaris but has been fitted out with an o2 designed housing as was the original orbit this resultant blend of htc technology and o2 style serves to produce a modern looking and attractive machine the orbit 2 serves to bring to the user a high level of features 3mpixel camera fast processor large ram rom gps quad band phone touch interface etc o2 are back with another revolutionary orbit design but will it follow through and gain on the success of the original orbit or will it be found lacking well look at its features as we move through the review and see if the orbit 2 does carry on the traditions of the original orbit once more we extend our thanks to the generous folks at o2 for allowing us to review the xda orbit 2
6890365 at first glance this is nothing special the face on shots on the o2 website depict what looks like a bog standard windows mobile pda phone theres a large 2 8in screen above which sits a small lens for making video calls below which is a familiar looking cluster of control buttons you can see the usual pick up and hang up buttons plus a couple of shortcut keys for activating the start menu and ok commands and these flank what looks like a standard five way navigation key a superb touchscreen with accompanying software enhancements and the inclusion of the excellent copilot sat nav software and kit all elevate the o2 xda orbit 2 from potential also ran to viable choice if you dont need the keyboard of the tytn ii its a competent and reasonably priced alternative even if it isnt quite as compact as one might desire

6890375 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
6890376 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
6890377 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
6890378 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
6890379 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
6890380 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life

6890384 el asesinato fue cometido en el marco de un ataque sistem tico a la poblaci n civil llevado a cabo por las organizaciones terroristas
6890385 el poder legislativo nacional resultar a responsable por cuanto el 26 de junio de 1973 amnisti a los guerrilleros sin desarmarlos suprimi la c mara federal en lo penal y la legislaci n antiterrorista dejando en libertad a algunos de los que secuestraron al militar
6890386 la estrategia de los ex guerrilleros estaba centrada en considerar prescriptos sus asesinatos secuestros y torturas por tratarse de delitos comunes realizados sin participaci n estatal
6890387 las cr nicas parlamentarias prueban que la clase pol tica contribuy a la tragedia sobreviniente calificando a quienes hab an sido condenados por hechos terroristas como perseguidos pol ticos que lucharon por la liberaci n y contra la dependencia
6890388 el desarrollo de las organizaciones guerrilleras en la argentina escapa a tipificaciones simplistas el erp prt no era una fuerza progresista sino una organizaci n revolucionaria que pretend a instaurar una sociedad marxista inspirada por el faro de la revoluci n cubana desde sus or genes consider que la v a pac fica al socialismo era una imposibilidad por lo que el cambio social s lo podr a llegar a trav s de una guerra revolucionaria
6890389 la violaci n de los derechos humanos de larrabure tuvo lugar en ocasi n de un conflicto armado conforme los lineamientos de la jurisprudencia internacional que en la causa milosevic ha explicado que el concepto de conflicto armado requiere nicamente que existan grupos armados organizados que sean capaces de librar combate y que de hecho lo hagan
6890390 sus ataques fueron sistem ticos pues estuvieron organizados de acuerdo con una pol tica y un plan n tidamente delineados
6890391 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6890392 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6890393 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6890394 just getting caught up in something so long as i dont make any mistakes have lapses in judgment and we dont get caught up in something i think we should be pretty good
6890395 youve got to be sharp youve got to be on your game theres no time to take a breath around this place it is very very fast and thats what makes it fun and exciting
6890396 i think it creates excitement burton said and the chance that a driver whose team has done well all year could fade with a difficult three week run is all a part of it

6890403 were going to come out and throw it a lot
6890404 itll be good to see i know we can run the football thats no secret we were good last year i think well be better this year to come out and run the ball again and do it this game really isnt important because im not worried about that i want to see how much we can do with our first unit throwing the ball
6890405 hopefully we get a two minute drill at the end of the first half
6890406 if not we may manufacture that at some point so jamarcus will have a two minute drill there with our number one offense live it wont happen in the last game
6890407 its better than the deep ball sometimes letting the back breaks a few tackles get a first down or a big run
6890408 we kind of forced that in my head and im just kind of living by that right now
6890409 the last couple games we havent started especially well on both sides of the ball
6890410 my dad was at an sc practice the other day and he was talking to pete carroll
6890411 lane had told pete to tell me that hes coming after me this weekend well see
6890412 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
6890413 well come after him every snap and put a bounty in the locker room on him
6890414 well see some things that were not ready for because oakland is a team that likes to put pressure on you their defense on our offense
6890415 but its good for us its a good test for our receivers our quarterbacks and our line as far as picking things up and trying to operate efficiently

6890422 in the spring of 2009 we plan to have two international events outside of the united kingdom
6890423 were looking at italy sweden australia and the philippines we want to go to germany in 2009 but we havent launched television
6890424 i think lorenzo fertitta says it best were we going to launch with a standard marketing plan or did we want to reach as dana white said every sheepherder in the country
6890425 he decided lets just spend to be sure what we realized after two events is that we didnt have to spend as much once we got to london for the third u k show sept 8 2007 show we realized the ufc was bigger than we anticipated
6890426 you used to say ufc and people would say huh
6890427 now say ufc and every cab driver knows exactly what youre talking about
6890428 a big reason was to get all the shows airing live
6890429 our diehard fans will stay up until 4 a m to watch it live there may only be 10 000 to 15 000 of them but we have to present it as a sport where people see the events live
6890430 we do believe in the matriculation of wwe fans to ufc
6890431 we look at places where wwe has had five years of success after three to five years of following wwe many fans are ready to graduate to the ufc
6890432 bisping has made it a bit easier but the people want to see the ufc fighters theyve seen on television
6890433 we saw that in belfast with the reactions to rich franklin and forrest griffin bisping is great but they want to see the television stars if bisping doesnt win ultimate fighter 3 wed still be successful
6890434 it didnt really look like fernando wanted to be out there i dont think thats any secret
6890435 theyre kind of going for broke and they dont have much to lose they kind of have an excuse that was tough
6890436 at the beginning he played really good and i played horrible
6890437 in the second i played better and he started to miss much more and in the third set he served really good and i didnt have too many chances to break him
6890438 i need to forget about today about all the mistakes i made and try to see everything positively for the open
6890439 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time

6890522 el sionismo quiere crear un hogar para los jud os en palestina al amparo de la ley p blica
6890523 el control jud o en los medios de comunicaci n del mundo
6890524 en todo pa s en el cual se han establecido los jud os han sido sujeto de odio y desprecio por el monopolio que imponen sobre la mayor a de los recursos econ micos con los cuales vive el resto de la gente en la obra
6890525 uno puede llegar a pensar que el xito de los jud os no ha sido pura coincidencia es resultado de muchos a os de continua plantaci n rigurosa la cual inclu a y sirvi de precedente para tener el control total de los medios de comunicaci n
6890526 el primer congreso sionista llevado a cabo en basilea en 1897 fue el momento decisivo porque los participantes expresaron su deseo de implementar un complot criminal para establecer el estado de israel
6890527 sin embargo el pueblo jud o no pudo alterar su imagen obscena hasta a principios del nuevo siglo ya que muchas naciones occidentales lucharon en contra de actividades sionistas especialmente los estadounidense quienes estaban ocupados consolidando su federaci n
6890528 cuando comenz la persecuci n nazi el viento inicio a soplar en su favor hitler expuso el complot jud o la opini n p blica global manipulada por los jud os se aprovecho de esta persecuci n diseminando cuentos sobre una masacre colectiva inventaron cuentos horribles de c maras de gas las cuales utilizaban los nazis para quemar vivos a los jud os la prensa estaba llena de fotograf as de jud os asesinados bajo rdenes de hitler la prensa se enfoc en el sufrimiento de las mujeres ni os y ancianos para despertar compasi n y tener motivo para solicitar donativos reparaciones y ayuda de todo el mundo
6890529 la verdad es que dicha persecuci n fue una fabricaci n maliciosa elaborada por los jud os
6890530 un vistazo al n mero de agencias peri dicos revistas y cadenas de televisi n bajo control jud o demuestra la influencia que tienen en los medios de comunicaci n ellos controlan varios diarios franceses e en otros pa ses occidentales como australia son due os e varios medios de comunicaci n incluyendo las poderosas cadenas de televisi n cbs
6890531 es evidente que el control jud o sobre los medios de comunicaci n tiene el objetivo de cambiar la imagen de los jud os al mismo tiempo exponiendo a los rabes como los villanos del cuento submitted by cristof on thu 08 07 2008 21 43 es un hecho patente que el cine la televisi n y la prensa influyen en la manera de pensar y actuar de la gente los judios dominan hoy hollywood como han hecho desde el nacimiento de esta industria los judios dominan como actores directores y productores

6890537 how likely is it that you would recommend company x to a friend as a place to work
6890538 the response from option traders has been interesting especially in the october options where a trader appears to have played against the easy fix rumors
6890539 they may be betting on a low ball takeover they may betting on no takeover or they may be betting on more bad news
6890540 weve noticed the problem its true that users may fail to log in to itunes store right now
6890541 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6890542 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6890543 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6890544 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6890545 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6890546 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6890547 violated certain banking laws and regulations which are primarily related to the origination administration and monitoring of construction and mortgage loans
6890548 the examiners advised that they intend to recommend that the fdic and dfi take regulatory action against the bank with respect to such lending practices and activities which may include a cease and desist order monetary penalties further increases in allowances for loan losses reserves and or charge offs additionally the company has been cooperating in an investigation by the regulators pertaining to certain past activities involving former employees and third parties including possible fraud misconduct and other violations with respect to the application processing and approval of certain loans previously made the company is also conducting its own internal investigation into the issues surrounding the past activities of mortgage and construction loan origination and plans to retain an independent auditor to analyze these loans particularly construction loans and assist the company and its management in determining the appropriate level of loan loss allowances reserves or charge offs with respect to such loans
6890549 together they had overcome the daily incomprehension the instantaneous hatred the reciprocal nastiness and fabulous flashes of glory in the conjugal conspiracy it was time when they both loved each other best without hurry or excess when both were most conscious of and grateful for their incredible victories over adversity life would still present them with other moral trials of course but that no longer mattered they were on the other shore
6890550 wells notice nor the underlying investigation had anything to do with toms leaving the company
6890551 the fact that only individuals are being charged make it more likely that its the improper payment and not back office record keeping violations that the sec is investigating
6890552 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6890553 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6890554 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
6890555 i love you i am listening on my radio i love you
6890556 better yet put me in office make me your vice president hilary hated on you so that b tch is irrelevant

6890558 the long term goal of the studio is to take advantage of what has become a very global market by focusing on bigger films that require a bigger commitment
6890559 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6890560 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6890561 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6890562 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6890563 infact when we walked down towards the morris lighthouse there was water lapping underneath some of the houses and below it was the water retreats you can see just plain sand that was once dunes actually
6890564 we are responsible of the security of the transportation of oil from cambodia to other countries
6890565 so we have asked for international cooperation to fight terrorism
6890566 what we tried to do is help them understand what the legal challenges are how they can assist in collecting evidence and how they can assist in covering terrorism and fighting terrorists and bringing them to justice
6890567 the three confessed that they were hired to bring heroin from cambodia to taiwan
6890568 it was important for me to get here because for my family in to know they are a part of the gullah geechee nation i need them to know how proud they should be of our culture and our heritage

6890570 what is the reason that the co prosecutors did not include this case in the closing order of duch
6890571 then we thought we will do historical research and we want to know further why 177 prisoners were released
6890572 in the closing order co investigating judges did not mention this and it seems that in the closing order all people who were detained have been killed
6890573 this is their affair i cannot give further comment before the plenary trial
6890574 we think that all the work of ngos that provides interest in the tribunal will provide interest to our citizens
6890575 does not charge duch for his responsibility as co perpetrator for a significant number of crimes that occurred as part of a joint criminal enterprise inside s 21

6890577 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6890578 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6890579 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6890580 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6890581 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6890582 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6890583 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6890584 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6890585 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6890586 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6890587 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6890588 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could
6890589 you cant be in a bad mood i do make mistakes and i cant hide that basically i own up to it and know that theyre not going to go away im not perfect but i will try my hardest to be close
6890590 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6890591 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6890592 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6890593 the day when the world is prophesized to come to an end
6890594 all point to this specific date as the end of civilization
6890595 are predicting the end of the world as december 21 2012 besides the mayan i ching merlin book of revelation etc is it just a coincidence or a meaningless pattern of random events
6890596 our path is well charted now i think we have a good chance of raising our profile
6890597 it should simplify things and help us find a stronger identity which i think we need
6890598 there are fall releases that arent ready for venice and those are the movies that will go to rome
6890599 the issue is whether we can convince our detractors that we are not useless and also that the fest is not against them
6890600 because in a country where love for movies has always had a leftist connotation the center right is basically afraid of cinema
6890601 u s news has collected data from more than 1 400 colleges to bring you this years rankings
6890602 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050

6890606 coming off of his rookie season and his selection to the us olympic and national teams maurice has garnered a great deal of attention from other clubs around the world
6890607 lyon wanted me more than manchester united and immediately put their faith in me
6890608 with manchester talks dragged along whereas with lyon everything happened very quickly
6890609 it is a sporting decision even though i have spent 10 fantastic years at lens
6890610 it is a great moment for me but i am staying calm about it all i know i have to work hard now
6890611 one of my aims for the season is to make some appearances in the team
6890612 i am not worried about that i know nothing about it only that klaas feels very good at ajax
6890613 we have already said earlier that we dont want to see a repeat of what happened last season when a player left ajax at a very late stage
6890614 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6890615 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6890616 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6890617 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6890618 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6890619 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6890620 robinho has a contract with madrid but i think it would be harmful if he stayed at the club and wasnt happy about it because it would be bad for his career
6890621 he also has world cup qualification to play with his national team and i think this would be very bad for robinho
6890622 its robinhos opinion hes made known his interest in leaving madrid but its something the directors have to decide together with the player to find the best option for both
6890623 for me the best solution is for madrid to be okay
6890624 i think that there are top drawer substitutes for robinho who could occupy both the left and the right wing
6890625 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6890626 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6890627 today kaka underwent a check up by professor martens who had already checked up on him over the past few months
6890628 were going to release multi skus so pc ps3 360 q1 next year
6890629 they are stronger and also the match with argentina will be very difficult we need to have a positive mentality to win
6890630 it looks as if we have 11 fit players and if that is the case we will have to make a team from that
6890631 the match for the johan cruyff schaal shield comes at a bad time because we now have to play with a makeshift team
6890632 psv are favourites to win but if amateur side barendrecht can beat feyenoord then feyenoord can beat psv
6890633 it is the last test before the season begins and to see how far on we are at this moment
6890634 pre season could have been much better but there are reasons for this we have players at the olympics some players had injuries and some were playing for their national teams
6890635 he is a very good player a fantastic player who all the coaches in the world like and would want him in their squad
6890636 i want to leave ive told the president the directors and the coach i want to play in the premier league
6890637 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team
6890638 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6890639 ive played three seasons at real madrid and have given everything
6890640 i think my period at real madrid has come to an end i hope the directors reach an agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as quickly as possible
6890641 it needs to be understood that at that time he was at milan with different players with different characteristics
6890642 the champions there are different to the champions here we need to think about this balance
6890643 maybe he needs more confidence to train normally and to be given more time now i have nicolas anelka in a good situation and playing well
6890644 sheva needs time and i need time time to put him in the game in a situation better for chelsea and shevchenko because chelsea needs three points
6890645 at that time the federation had some problems taking me because i was with portugal and it is impossible to sign two contracts
6890646 we tried but it is impossible then i followed my life and the national team of england followed its own life
6890647 i am surprised by the news this week ive said before and will again i like brian he is a good man i met him three or four times and like his style and personality
6890648 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6890649 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
6890650 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems
6890651 the intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages
6890652 i started great i played well i was aggressive i had a chance early in the second set to put him away but it didnt happen
6890653 in the final set i got back to my fundamentals
6890654 ive never been higher than the number three american ive spent my entire career being that next guy
6890655 ive known caroline since i was eleven i knew that you have to be 100 percent in order to beat her it was just not the case today
6890656 i feel really confident its been a really good month for me
6890657 i won my first wta tournament in stockholm i would love to become number one in the world and win grand slams

6890661 oh no dude my mom just sent me a request to be my friend on facebook what should i do
6890662 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6890663 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6890664 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6890665 growing up bar coding was dinner conversation so i was familiar with it
6890666 and then one night while out to dinner i asked could we barcode sushi louisa and i love sushi and we thought why not apply the bar coding technology to see what food were eating
6890667 its not the fishermen and it might not even be the restaurants
6890668 most likely the mislabeling is occurring somewhere at the distribution level
6890669 many people are working on miniaturizing it bring the cost down and the speed to process up
6890670 sequencing is a chemical process there is no reason why we cant check the food on our plate and send the signal out to a database electronically gps used to be as big as refrigerators and only used by the government now its a common application in a phone
6890671 it didnt feel like a chore it wasnt time consuming at all
6890672 im hoping to get more public interest so it can become cheaper and more common
6890673 ive eaten it like 50 times since so i dont think so
6890674 oh no dude my mom just sent me a request to be my friend on facebook what should i do

6890679 i cannot read so why would he send this to me
6890680 we do see certain members of cells attempting to persuade women specifically in many cases wives of those who have been killed as terrorists conduct suicide operations
6890681 we received intelligence that this family was dealing with al qaeda and other criminals this letter is from abu dawood he is the one in charge of recruiting female suicide bombers
6890682 the psychological pressures of the security situation that we used to have in diyala the systematic killing especially in some parts of baquba where the governments forces presence was weak allowed the insurgents to use religion to exploit women
6890683 this is a red line so they take advantage of this weakness in iraqi society
6890684 is it possible to break out in hives after shaving
6890685 the one laptop per child programme has lived up to its name in the tiny south pacific nation of niue where 100 of children now have one 500 of the programmes xo laptops were distributed this week to primary and high school students
6890686 we are adding three charges resisting arrest creating a public disturbance and battery on a police officer and since this involved a religion we are treating it as a hate crime
6890687 they were kind enough to give me a few of the playboy bunny necklaces that i wear in the film i mean theyre not that expensive but it means a lot
6890688 it was my first nude scene and it wasnt supposed to be me

6890692 im sorry youre as big of a loser as i am but now we can be together forever
6890693 hello sanjaya in a strange way i sort of miss you
6890694 e disse dio ecco il segno del patto che io fo tra voi e me e con tutti gli animali viventi che sono con voi per generazioni eterne

6890696 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing this is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously whether human or nonhuman its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
6890697 i was delighted to see the humane society of the united states offer a 2 500 reward for information leading to the conviction of the arsonists
6890698 while pretending to be part of the solution the group continues to be a significant part of the problem an over zealous social movement bent on extending legal rights to animals whether or not thinking people like the consequences the entire community of santa cruz is learning this week what can happen when human beings resist the sort of evolution the animal rights community has planned for them and its not pretty
6890699 in many ways feedstuffs and ccf are absolutely right this is a turning point in history not just for the animal rights movement but for a country showing frightening parallels to the worst eras of government repression the question then is this should we all like hsus try to buy ourselves a little time or should we step up and fight the new mccarthyists head on
6890700 this should come as no surprise to anyone the humane society is concerned with the stewardship of animals as resources and or property whether lab animals or potential pets and not with animal liberation they are a thoroughly bourgeois law abiding outfit with government funding
6890701 this reward underscores the fact that the core of the animal protection movement regards tactics like this as immoral and counterproductive
6890702 if i had any idea who perpetrated this act i would be on the phone with the fbi in a heartbeat
6890703 as you might expect we are appalled by this action
6890704 our movements principles involve love compassion and peace unfortunately in any large movement there is always the possibility that one or more people might violate such principles
6890705 thanks to this incident its now harder than ever to hold the university publicly accountable for its support of factory farming
6890706 if you want to eliminate obscene amounts of needless animal cruelty the logical place to begin is not at the universitys research labs but at its dining halls ive been working for the past 18 months to try to get uc santa cruz to abandon serving factory farmed eggs how am i supposed to put pressure on the university to stop sourcing eggs from factory farms when these lunatic arsonists are grabbing headlines
6890707 its quite typical of authorities to drive a wedge between other left wing groups and so called fringe groups with heated rhetoric
6890708 this is bullshit either the government did this or these activists were out of line
6890709 where is the outrage and where are the wars to protect scientists like feldheim the citizens of santa cruz and the citys elected officials need to step up and condemn this sort of violence
6890710 why didnt the santa cruz coffee shop remove the threatening animal rights pamphlet that listed the names and addresses of 13 researchers and call the police
6890711 my impression is that the media coverage has been appallingly inept and the reason for that is very simple unlike many important political issues that emerge this is one that does not attract beat reporters
6890712 i think the problem is that the people reporting on this story have no background in any of these issues and as a result i think the coverage is appallingly simple minded i dont think this is a case of reporters seeking to mislead its just not part of their beat
6890713 the sort of activism i do is based on making good relationships with people
6890714 they are distracting focus from indefensible animal abuses that uc santa cruz perpetuates on an ongoing basis
6890715 theyve made the work of legitimate animal protection advocates unimaginably harder

6890720 the protestors were chanting for the independence of tibet which has been part of china for centuries
6890721 there is no doubt that such activities violate chinese law
6890722 demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people
6890723 these rights are protected by chinas own constitution and by international human rights standards to which china has agreed

6890748 in fact a lot of them turn out to have more european roots than they thought
6890749 my baby is black and blacker so get out my damn face
6890750 ninasimone in reality a lot of latinos dont think pr cuban amp dominican etc black

6890753 we are descended from kings queens and all that bullshit
6890754 lol more like our ancestors were sold by kings and queens
6890755 my personal pet peeves are caribbean trying to pretend that they are better than african americans
6890756 in fact most latinos i know are super racist towards african americans

6890761 the non partisan national research council found that when the taxes paid by the children of low skilled immigrant families most of whom are illegal are factored in they contribute on average 80 000 more to federal coffers than they consume
6890762 the immigrants have been able to file since 1996 when the irs started issuing special tax numbers for people living and working illegally in this country experts say the 8 million to 11 million illegal immigrants in the united states contribute untold billions each year in payroll taxes
6890763 these days most immigrants working unlawfully buy a document combo for 100 to 200 that includes a fake green card and fake social security card with a nine digit number plucked out of thin air
6890764 theyll make it for you right there at the flea market
6890765 which is why they are never leaving and will soon be much more successful than us prestigious af
6890766 i just dont understand how people can think so negatively about people who are struggling in this country with poverty and racism in much the same way that black people are and who are by and large honestly just doing the best they can for themselves and their families
6890767 second all of these separate businesses that you refer to already existed in the black american community during segregation during that time we provided most of needed services to ourselves
6890768 a lot of the immigrant struggle does build on the backs of the black struggle
6890769 i want to experience the same kind of community leadership and financial stability without having to go en mass to a foreign country
6890770 its like feeling sorry for someone who takes a shit in your backyard
6890771 if you were to go to a country where you know full and damn well you were going to be poor and experience racism would you still go and then whine about it

6890788 the redistributionist rhetoric of the obama camp demands financial and standard of living guarantees disconnected from an individuals hard work productivity or moral worth
6890789 a society becomes rich only if its members create wealth
6890790 liberals want economic intervention not to protect or reward virtue but to restrain the natural consequences of virtuous behavior such as disciplined work patient saving stable family formation and entrepreneurial risk taking
6890791 instead of glorifying the business people who sustain communities and provide jobs liberals try to show their compassion by sanctifying the homeless a population overwhelmingly categorized by substance abuse criminality and untreated mental illness
6890792 every war in american history involved an economic motivation at least in part and nearly all of our great leaders saw nothing disgraceful in going to battle to defend the commercial vitality of the country
6890793 a non christian like joe lieberman could easily preside over state occasions because even though his faith differs significantly from that of the christian majority his obvious attachment to faith in god and old testament principles shows sympathy not hostility to the generalized value of faith

6890799 it doesnt take a lot youre not going to see it

6890813 it appears richardson is making a mockery of the court
6890814 it appears that he has re offended in an extremely short period of time

6890818 what this shows is that these immune responses can last pretty much the entire human lifetime
6890819 i thought this is so good an idea why dont we do this in real life
6890820 when dr basler first chatted with me about doing the 1918 flu rather than new flu s i thought it was crazy i really thought it couldnt be done
6890821 was a combination of art and luck weve developed techniques that are good yet we feel we were lucky in some ways
6890822 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever known
6890823 its kind of counterintuitive because people think of the elderly as having a weak immune system
6890824 because it tells us that human beings can make fantastic antibodies to one avian influenza
6890825 conventional wisdom today is that everyone who died then died of viral infection but thats just not true and that was known back then
6890826 its hard to argue with the data per se theres some bacterial co infection
6890827 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
6890828 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
6890829 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
6890830 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials

6890835 discovery was wrong to continue to rotate the new promos long after the debacle besides perpetuating a lie it showed a lack of professionalism so to say they didnt do anything wrong is in itself wrong

6890857 understand this instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn english you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
6890858 you should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual its embarrassing when europeans come over here they all speak english and then we go over to europe and all we can say is merci beaucoup
6890859 it was a setback but i believe i will be a better person and a better congressman because of it

6890864 were seeing significant progress in iraq through the surge and while there are still significant problems i think this helps me in his quest to retake his lost seat
6890865 there needs to be an increased nato presence in afghanistan
6890866 well probably need a surge of troops there but it shouldnt just be our troops
6890867 that would amount to the largest tax increase in the history of this country
6890868 doing these things would help bring down costs without going to a government run system
6890869 i also got an earmarked passed for night vision goggles for our troops in iraq
6890870 90 percent of teen girls say they have been harassed at least once

6890912 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes

6890916 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6890917 they seem to think our community is their open job site

6890919 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
6890920 we asked them to move certain locations and they voluntarily did
6890921 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6890922 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6890923 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6890924 i told them just go out and tell bad jokes be a hero in the field
6890925 the younger you are and the closer you are in age to your failed humorist the more likely you are to attack
6890926 i may have been nancy funny but i was not french speaking nancy funny
6890927 i want to know what makes my little nephew tick
6890928 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
6890929 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
6890930 you can think about it as control by the director
6890931 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
6890932 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
6890933 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
6890934 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
6890935 you can go to the area that processes the soundtrack see any correlations and then go to the lighting and then the plot and so forth

6890938 signing an ad revenue deal early would give verizon an advantage over its competitors
6890939 i think this is a competitive response by verizon to the google iphone deal which has shown the right partnerships can push cell phone adaptation by the consumer

6890942 when you look at deals like clearwire or even new 3g and 4g services its easy to see why theyd be interested in getting a foothold in the mobile data market
6890943 if at some point verizon decides not to deal with google anymore there is no reason for google to have access to data related to verizons customers
6890944 i think its a good idea for google to insist that verizon be open to android
6890945 they want to make the user experience better for the customer but they also know that having an install base on its operating system much like

6890963 se la nota musicale dicesse non la nota che fa la musica
6890964 we did a hell of a job keeping our composure im glad it could have gotten ugly
6890965 if you try to play showtime the way the u s plays you try to throw the ball up theyre going to be better they jump higher they run faster theyre stronger youve got make them feel uncomfortable thats the only way
6890966 because you play solid defense you stay in between your man and the ball you rebound the basketball now that turns into transition points and then when they see the physical stuff is not working they get a little frantic they get worried
6890967 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
6890968 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

6890978 we are just glad to be able to help and let the ia take the lead with the combined medical engagement
6890979 hopefully every clinic in thawra 1 will get repeated visits from the ia as they are operating with more independence every day

6890994 i have so much more of a kumbaya approach to it than you do its not a game you know

6890996 maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat wij het daarover nog wel eens zullen worden
6890997 this race course starts off at over 40 miles per hour and then disappears into some of the best naturally challenging downhill single track anywhere
6890998 with no race conflicts in ontario we are expecting a large contingent of canadian riders which we havent had the previous two years the size of this years field should be much bigger
6890999 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6891000 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6891001 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6891002 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case

6891010 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6891011 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6891012 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6891013 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6891014 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6891015 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6891016 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6891017 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6891018 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6891019 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6891020 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude
6891021 but if there is a specific individual who is dead set on perpetrating a crime an act of violence on another individual which was the case in this situation theyre likely to find a way to do it
6891022 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here

6891034 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die

6891037 the only moment of conciliation at that convention was the tribute to bob
6891038 i dont think many republicans would want their kids to get in the car with senator kennedy
6891039 there is a resonance with the kennedys that motivates people to act on the basis of compassion
6891040 for others its laziness youre too lazy to work and support your children im talking about men you call yourself mr mom god calls you a bum st paul says you are worse than an infidel let me look you right in the eye and tell you that hell is your future home if all you do is sit on your backside and let your wife support you in your life
6891041 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
6891042 without a sponsor these children dont have hope when they have a sponsor you can see a difference in their whole face because now they have hope for a future
6891043 theres definitely been an increase in new bike sales and also in repairs
6891044 people bringing in bikes that have been in the garage for years to be fixed up
6891045 we are looking at expanding our recreational and bike trails
6891046 right now the bikes are concentrated to that trail but were also trying to consider connections and connection hubs in the commercial areas
6891047 i honestly think its due and i hope its a successful attempt at creating another option for these people
6891048 i think if it was a separate path or a bike lane something like that i think it would really encourage people to ride more
6891049 fifty five years of em they are the sports car of the united states

6891108 the cost of power resulting from luminants inability to consistently operate has forced us to make this decision
6891109 we have been forced to seek damages and other relief from them through ongoing litigation
6891110 for the past two months luminant has offered alcoa additional price protections along with a stable predictable and economically viable power supply
6891111 alcoa has refused taking an inflexible stance seeking power at unrealistically advantageous terms and demanding a price far below the prevailing commercial market price

6891150 a remarkably accurate adaptation of thackerays novel about the rise and fall of a duplicitous irishman in eighteenth century england but by simply changing the point of view turning the heros firstperson narration into a seemingly omniscient though subtly fallible third person voice over kubrick transformed a picaresque into a heartbreakingly ironic meditation on destiny

6891192 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6891193 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6891194 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6891195 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6891196 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6891197 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them

6891201 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
6891202 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
6891203 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
6891204 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
6891205 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
6891206 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
6891207 theres a maximum occupancy here of 302 and we have 240 people from our delegation staying here

6891215 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
6891216 whos he gonna raise taxes on if he keeps the status quo id rather see us manage our economy keep taxes lower and focus on the spending
6891217 we need to stop lying to the american people that all of a sudden gas prices are going to go back to what they were 10 years ago

6891230 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos

6891282 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies

6891390 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6891391 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6891392 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6891393 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6891394 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6891395 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6891396 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6891397 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6891398 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6891399 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6891400 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude

6891408 several senators have formally complained that citizens could be investigated without any basis for suspicion
6891409 we really dont have much of a reaction because we do not have many alcohol related incidents on campus
6891410 we were contacted to sign and decided we wouldnt sign even though we were sympathetic to some of the motivations that prompted it
6891411 were going to have a meeting of the vice presidents council next thursday and were going to talk about it
6891412 were going to pull in some of the people on campus who really are familiar with the issues
6891413 that is the extent of the statement we wish to say about it
6891414 i am not encouraging teenagers to drink that is not why i signed it
6891415 we have a drinking problem in the nation on college campuses the current law does not resolve it
6891416 you can sign up to die for our country but you cant drink
6891417 it doesnt make sense if you can make that choice you should be able to do both
6891418 the tendency to go overboard is because you dont know your limits
6891419 if its not forbidden you dont feel the need to go overboard
6891420 the issue is not going to go away or change with the age
6891421 and if college presidents believe it will they are just putting their heads in the sand
6891422 we are saddled with a very difficult enforcement problem and disabled to some extent to carrying on the education function the best way possible
6891423 once you go to college the expectation is that youre going to drink
6891424 rather than hide it these college presidents acknowledge the situation its definitely something we should think about

6891431 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6891432 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6891433 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6891434 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6891435 would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6891436 i feel like even around the circle this afternoon there was some profiling going on of black people today we want you guys to come up with a work plan i have to live with the fact that im profiled every day the things you are doing are wonderful but why cant we come up with a written work plan so that we can check off each of the things on the list

6891591 also the people on the board are volunteering all of their time obviously they care about the community
6891592 thank you for allowing us to take advantage of you in the form of your absentee votes
6891593 way to give a little something back to the community
6891594 we can center in on very particular things and be much more specific
6891595 when we were going against ourselves offensively on defense the priority was the installation of our systems maybe the other side had a pass pattern on offense or a pressure on defense that was going to give us a little bit of trouble but we wouldnt necessarily deviate from our installation plan in order to game plan that or to try to deal with that we just kind of handle it as it came now we deal specifically with all the different issues that the opponent presents us
6891596 we lost one of the all time great players here in chris long
6891597 certainly thats not the type of player that you even attempt to replace for us they come along few and far between so we kind of have to do that in an aggregate way but some of those players on last years team really kind of helped us solidify the culture of our team and there were many of the current players who were part of that effort from an attitude standpoint we see very a positive carryover
6891598 we certainly recognize were playing a team that has earned the right to be in a league of their own

6891605 it is the intent to increase staff hours and library services in the future with the new community library facility
6891606 furthermore the library board is taking proactive measures to be fiscally responsible in this time of uncertainty regarding property taxes
6891607 q what will be the fate of the old building at third and morgan streets a nothing has been decided as to the use of the current building
6891608 however the current building served the public well during the 20th century our board and architect want to honor the building by incorporating architectural features of the old building into the new building which will serve the community through the 21st century
6891609 the library is more than a building its programs information entertainment and more

6891629 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009

6891657 the festival grounds are very small and sandwiched in amongst the houses of the town the foot and road traffic noise trash and number of people are difficult for the citizens to cope with under normal circumstances
6891658 the town does not need a parade through the streets right now or a civil war encampment or helicopter tours or dance recitals or concerts or a flea market or trolley rides or any of those things that are part of the festival the festival committee owns the small plot of land where the festival is held each year but they do not live in moscow and have not had to endure daily the suffering and devastation that has befallen the citizens of the town the money that will be generated from the moscow covered bridge festival will not and never has gone back to the actual residents of the town
6891659 many are beginning to show classic signs of post traumatic stress disorder from all they have endured over the past two weeks

6891662 i know that our board has been focused on the construction of restrooms in the park but the board felt that it would be only appropriate to take a weekend away from that goal and focus on those in our community that are in more immediate need
6891663 the goal of the concert series has always been to provide a place and events to revive and unite our local community and at the same time show visitors what a great place rushville and rush county is to live work or visit i think this is the time when we need to show our greatest asset community spirit

6891669 this will only enhance the community and when you improve something in your town or city it makes it more appealing to outsiders its easy to see theres not enough of a lot in this library
6891670 theres not a lot of room not a lot of accessibility making it insufficient in several areas and maybe if the library is able to improve their building and make it nicer the rest of downtown will follow in its footsteps

6891678 its a pity the current administration doesnt show as much concern now for the health of its citizens as it did for the non existent problems with the police department when they were all hot to get elected is this the level of neglect and in competence we can expect for the next 3 1 2 years
6891679 rushville city utilities has all our names and addresses and the latest bill just recently arrived so it would have been no trouble at all for the city to inform its residents ahead of time at little expense all that would have been required would be to use envelopes for the bill this one time with a notice enclosed
6891680 he has made it clear to all who read it that he is a true supporter of the former administration thus it is no surprise that his criticism of me takes precedence over his concern for water quality
6891681 this was a poor judgment call and i didnt make it
6891682 and to you mr huston if you find this administration so intolerable then maybe you should remove yourself from its shadow lest you be tainted by it i call for your resignation from the rushville historic board
6891683 hes exactly lived up to the absolutely zero expectations i had for him
6891684 if you find this administration so intolerable maybe you should remove yourself from its shadow lest you be tainted from it

6891800 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6891801 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6891802 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6891803 i had grandparents down in florida and i had an uncle in massachusetts
6891804 my daughter asked me didnt they know a hurricane was coming but no one said anything to me about it
6891805 it was a large steamer we got on it and we had dinner it was beautiful going down the bay
6891806 we got i dont know how far down when the hurricane hit we bounced all over the place the ship rocked from side to side when the bow went up and down the propellers came out of the water and made the whole ship vibrate
6891807 my mother got so sick she wanted to get off the ship
6891808 my father and i were the only two who went down to dinner that night most everybody else was sick i think i was too young to know what was going on
6891809 the water kept leaking in through the portholes and we had about a foot of water the boat would tip and the water would run to one side then it would tip and run the other way
6891810 they built up planks for us to walk on in the dock area
6891811 it seemed like the building was swaying all night long
6891812 he gives it his all on every second of every play you see that and youre like youve got to do the same thing
6891813 you see a guy playing that hard youll do anything not to let him down
6891814 you hear a lot of things about kobe but i had no idea he was such a basketball junkie
6891815 he studies all the film talks basketball all the time knows everything
6891816 were good friends so none of what he does surprises me
6891817 i would like to thank all the people who carried this petition
6891818 we have a lot of work to do and i look forward to your support in september and in november
6891819 when working men and women go to the polls this november they will be able to vote for me on the save jobs and farms party line
6891820 in this district you need two lines a major party line and a minor party line to win ive wanted to do the save jobs party since 04 when i first started running thats really my line and i know this will draw a lot of people to the line
6891821 dave mays and benzino recently opened a new multi million dollar facility with offices and state of the art recording studios in miami

6891823 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6891824 i like the fact that for the most part my poems are pretty accessible
6891825 i watched the first half and then stopped watching because i felt the game was over
6891826 chelsea will be one of the super candidates to fight for the title but i feel we have enough to fight with them
6891827 there was not one factor why we fell away last season it was a conjunction of a few things like injuries some bad luck as well as a bit of inexperience and nervousness
6891828 we have a short squad yes and we cannot afford 10 injuries like other teams with big numbers
6891829 but i think we have the right number of players who can compete at the top level when everyone is fit
6891830 that is not the case at the moment but through the season we should get guys like diaby rosicky and eduardo back
6891831 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6891832 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year
6891833 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6891834 the risks imposed on the system as a whole if common exposures significantly increased the correlation of returns across institutions

6891836 lehman has left neuberger managers alone and let them do their thing
6891837 one would hope that any buyer would see that and not meddle with them
6891838 deals in the 1990s didnt pay attention to this and they all fell apart as a result
6891839 these arent coming from dividends or interest from holdings or even short term capital gains these funds just havent been making money
6891840 theyve launched in a challenging market where all funds have gone down
6891841 the market is exposing one of the big risks of these types of funds its a rational strategy but the danger is markets can stay irrational for longer than the fund can remain solvent
6891842 the market is exposing one of the big risks of these types of funds
6891843 its a rational strategy but the danger is markets can stay irrational for longer than the fund can remain solvent
6891844 its going to be difficult not to eat into principal
6891845 theres a significant risk in assuming that you if you put x dollars in a payout fund youre going to get enough income from it to pay your mortgage each month
6891846 a potential willing suitor for a company that recently has been all about headline risk is providing solid footing for the financial sector
6891847 were getting more constructive on the stock market and we would say the next big move up for financials would be when you have more willing merger and acquisition activity
6891848 we had a confluence of positive comments that have lifted stocks lifted the dollar and caused commodity prices to come in
6891849 we are committed to growing our presence in derivatives markets globally

6891862 the imposition of a premium increase at this time could have de stabilized our health care delivery system to the serious detriment of our patients and of all new yorkers
6891863 every time hes played in a game hes made plays ive just got my fingers crossed that he can stay healthy thats been his only problem
6891864 its been hard i wanted this tournament to be big for me and in the middle of it my hamstring went
6891865 it seems to be more neural from my back and its just impact which makes it tighten up every now and then it was pretty frustrating through that middle patch because thats where we really need to get some wins
6891866 i just think for the whole tournament individuals havent stepped up and at tournaments like this everyone has to step up
6891867 its a big tournament and youve got to turn up to play every single game and unfortunately we didnt
6891868 our game is to play short and work it through the midfield then get it up to the strikers i dont think we created enough opportunities going goalwards and thats what wins you the games overall its pretty frustrating
6891869 were going to have to do a lot of basics back home we did a lot of mis traps in this tournament which is unusual i dont know if it was the pressure that got to us or what it was but individually we need to take responsibility and work out why we didnt perform and then build from there
6891870 if you get into a few of our senior teams people cant reverse or overhead and theres little kids overseas doing it
6891871 we have no reason to believe that air new zealand was in any way remiss they did everything they could
6891872 some women do get on flights and dont tell airlines
6891873 the geographic areas covered by rural neighbourhood policing officers will tend to be fairly large due to the wider spread of population and may encompass a number of villages or smaller settlements the officers role will be to identify the priorities that are important to the people living in the area they cover and to work with local people and other partners on solving those problems in addition to resources that other partners may be able to offer to support the officer they will be able to call on other neighbourhood officers sergeants pcs and police community support officers from surrounding neighbourhoods police response teams and other specialized police resources to help them when necessary in many areas there are also special constables other community volunteers and neighbourhood watch working with neighbourhood teams so although i can understand your concern at the apparent coverage the real picture is far more positive

6891897 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6891898 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6891899 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6891900 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6891901 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6891902 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6891903 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6891904 his two options were to have the knee fixed immediately or to brace it and try to play

6891910 the music creator thing were a company of musicians right i have a band and a song in the game we have over 40 bands in the company 85 of us play an instrument we really get music weve talked about doing a music creator weve actually done them before in other games that weve done like in amplitude and frequency weve done the whole midi creation thing
6891911 we think we can do something really ambitious and really great thats going to speak across all the users of the game not just hardcore users and that will result in some awesome stuff and not just final fantasy covers i mean i like them ff covers too
6891912 so harmonix is going to do something great with it music creation down the road we didnt want to rush it out and do it half assed this is definitely a full on project for us youll hear more about it soon
6891913 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
6891914 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
6891915 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
6891916 real madrid have become aware of the declarations by the player and deeply regret their content
6891917 real madrid would never want to retain a player against his wishes and as a result they have no alternative but to accept his unilateral decision to rescind his contract if that is what the player wants

6891921 the gold medal was so exciting because for a sportsman this is what they want
6891922 i always try to improve my tennis try to be a better player than before every month every year
6891923 for sure i am very happy to be the no1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because i was very happy being the no2 as well finally im no1 it is satisfying but i dont have time to celebrate too much i play new york these next two weeks probably after new york after davis cup spain have a world group semi final against the united states in madrid im going to have a good time
6891924 he is probably my favourite tennis player to watch and i actually walked up to him and i was like i just want to meet you
6891925 i told him i watch you all the time when you play tennis and i love watching you play tennis i told him good luck he is probably the only person i wanted to meet
6891926 what is important is that i keep up my good work to keep the good people around you that give you that good work
6891927 so for that reason i think i am here right now the percentage of how it is going to be different from no2 to no1 is impossible to calculate i say for me things havent changed too much between four weeks ago two weeks ago and right now
6891928 i guess you call it the cell then were going to go to eddie vedders show hes playing at the auditorium which is kind of cool were pretty good friends obviously he was here today and then who knows well just do a milk run all over the city i know im bringing it with the wrong team but at least i brought it back home

6891940 thats the problem with the anti sweatshop movement youre not going to get customers walking into stores by asking for mercy and gratitude
6891941 actually go out of their way to purchase environmentally sound products
6891942 the opportunity to appear altruistic by committing to a charitable act in a prior task
6891943 the lessons are clear companies should segment their market and make a particular effort to reach out to buyers with high ethical standards because those are the customers who can deliver the biggest potential profits on ethically produced goods

6891956 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
6891957 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6891958 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6891959 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with
6891960 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
6891961 the government needs to do something it doesnt have to have a meeting with me
6891962 we understand that ac ghaffur has initiated proceedings in an
6891963 going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6891964 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6891965 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
6891966 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization

6891970 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him but how are things going for you

6891986 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
6891987 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6891988 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6891989 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6891990 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6891991 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6891992 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6891993 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6891994 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6891995 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6891996 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6891997 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6891998 he is a father even though it was a crime for him to be a father his life is changed forever
6891999 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6892000 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6892001 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6892002 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6892003 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6892004 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6892005 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6892006 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6892007 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6892008 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6892009 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6892010 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6892011 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6892012 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6892013 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6892014 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6892015 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6892016 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6892017 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6892018 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6892019 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6892020 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6892021 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6892022 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6892023 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6892024 agencies incur a significant legal risk if they continue to call unauthorized cell phones
6892025 but removing cell phone numbers from all dialing pools creates a likely drop in productivity and collections without this solution from ontario systems collection agencies are in a very difficult position
6892026 this product is far superior to any other solution for this potentially damaging ruling
6892027 it allows our clients to remain 100 percent in compliance while still maintaining their productivity levels
6892028 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6892029 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6892030 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6892031 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6892032 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6892033 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6892034 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6892035 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6892036 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6892037 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6892038 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6892039 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6892040 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6892041 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6892042 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6892043 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6892044 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6892045 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6892046 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6892047 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6892048 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6892049 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6892050 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6892051 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6892052 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6892053 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6892054 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6892055 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6892056 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6892057 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6892058 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6892059 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6892060 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6892061 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6892062 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6892063 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6892064 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6892065 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6892066 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6892067 turkey in cold storage is the largest since 2003 and chicken in cold storage is the largest since 2002
6892068 these cold storage stocks really reflect some struggling in the white meat marketplace both on the turkey breast side and on the chicken breast side
6892069 it is mostly because of a lack of demand in the deli and lunch type of businesses
6892070 la oposici n ecuatoriana est siguiendo la misma estrategia que en venezuela y bolivia l deres universitarios venezolanos estuvieron en ecuador ense ando t cticas a la oposici n para generar violencia antes del referendo constitucional del 28 de setiembre
6892071 uno de los representantes de la violencia juvenil venezolana vino ac a organizar eso vino a ense arle a la gente c mo se usa la violencia
6892072 la misma t ctica le hicieron a el presidente venezolano hugo ch vez empujar a l deres juveniles universitarios para crear confrontaci n y echarle la culpa al gobierno
6892073 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6892074 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6892075 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6892076 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6892077 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6892078 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6892079 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6892080 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6892081 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6892082 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6892083 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6892084 exactly the main question is where there is nothing left anymore
6892085 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6892086 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants
6892087 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6892088 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6892089 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6892090 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6892091 a loose ligament and im waiting to get more info on what i need to do
6892092 i think he can be close to 100 percent and get back with some real good rehab work
6892093 hes been doing a great job with it and i think he just needs some more time right now
6892094 these arent coming from dividends or interest from holdings or even short term capital gains these funds just havent been making money
6892095 theyve launched in a challenging market where all funds have gone down
6892096 the market is exposing one of the big risks of these types of funds its a rational strategy but the danger is markets can stay irrational for longer than the fund can remain solvent
6892097 the market is exposing one of the big risks of these types of funds
6892098 its a rational strategy but the danger is markets can stay irrational for longer than the fund can remain solvent
6892099 its going to be difficult not to eat into principal
6892100 theres a significant risk in assuming that you if you put x dollars in a payout fund youre going to get enough income from it to pay your mortgage each month
6892101 you cant tell me if a young quarterback proves himself as the starter this year that his agent wont be working off the ryan contract in his next negotiations

6892136 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6892137 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6892138 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6892139 so youre going to be out all day tomorrow the whole day
6892140 oh dear that doesnt sound good you should really be more careful
6892141 die lehman geschichte k nnte mittelzufl sse in den sicheren hafen der staatsanleihen etwas bremsen
6892142 mothers that are having their first child need it so they know what to do
6892143 when you think about the six seven cars that are still battling that out eight cars maybe those eight cars are in a position where finishing 12th is way better than finishing 38th
6892144 you dont want to go out there and risk running out of fuel or anything but theres not a lot you can do here
6892145 a lot of the wrecks that you end up finding yourselves in here are because of something that happened two or three cars ahead of you
6892146 just getting caught up in something so long as i dont make any mistakes have lapses in judgment and we dont get caught up in something i think we should be pretty good
6892147 youve got to be sharp youve got to be on your game theres no time to take a breath around this place it is very very fast and thats what makes it fun and exciting
6892148 i think it creates excitement burton said and the chance that a driver whose team has done well all year could fade with a difficult three week run is all a part of it
6892149 or they ask me if im related to mayor bloomberg
6892150 when they ask me if im related to mayor bloomberg i say hes my uncle
6892151 i jumped in the hall of fame through the back door rather than the front door and im just fine with that
6892152 because this is something they can never take away from me the dh whether you like or dont like it its always going to be there
6892153 who ever thought in 73 that 35 years later the dh would still be in existence everybody said it was a gimmick nobody thought it would stick
6892154 for so many years people thought a relief pitcher would never be in the hall of fame
6892155 bruce sutter and then goose getting in this year thats a good sign i think edgar martinez will get in
6892156 every time i go there i wonder how in the world are they going to tear down yankee stadium
6892157 there were always three parks i thought would never get torn down wrigley field
6892158 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6892159 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6892160 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6892161 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6892162 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6892163 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6892164 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6892165 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6892166 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6892167 if you trust every web site but not a government
6892168 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6892169 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6892170 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6892171 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6892172 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates

6892179 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood

6892183 americas heroes at work really focuses on the employment challenges of our returning veterans from the war on terror if they are living with a brain injury or living with a stress disorder
6892184 we know that a number of our servicemembers are coming back with some level of brain injury as a result of blast injuries or successive blast injuries or may be coming back with stress
6892185 we know its a significant enough issue that we want to pay some serious attention to it
6892186 every school year parents work to keep their children out of certain teachers classes because those teachers are bullies
6892187 it is often the parents who are least involved in their childrens lives whose children get the abusive teachers
6892188 you are looking for fear of the school yard anxiety about who will be in their class talk of having no friends worry about their teachers treatment of them and in general a focus on feeling safe rather than excited to be able to learn and grow
6892189 children who are bullied need to know they are not the problem
6892190 bullying is about the bully needing to feel powerful they believe their wants are more important than anyone elses
6892191 there are lifelong repercussions of bullying that effect the way a person functions in their home and in society said barnicke belleghem
6892192 bullying causes a loss in self confidence hinders achievement disrupts routines brings fear into the lives of parents and children
6892193 an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of patients
6892194 i find it somewhat amazing brian was transferred to a room where the lady hung herself
6892195 saddened embarrassed and concerned reading the surveyors observations about our psychiatric unit
6892196 no change in policy implemented no form changes and no formal time plan for the increased observation to take place
6892197 i dont understand how two people in a psychiatric unit managed to hang themselves
6892198 he was in a psychiatric unit he was not supposed to be able to do stuff like that the hospital is responsible for neglect
6892199 people pay closer attention to the merchandise at target than they did to these two people someone needs to be charged criminally for this
6892200 all of the employees physicians and volunteers understand that the community must have absolute trust in the operation of our psychiatric unit
6892201 we werent that good when we unloaded but the guys worked on it its a great starting position and well take it

6892218 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6892219 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6892230 with a little cooperation we might find that craigslist can help to turn around newspapers

6892242 its the absolute honor to coach your countrys team and to coach this level of talent its been an amazing experience and with my background being a west point graduate to the opportunity to serve again is too great of an opportunity to pass up

6892247 we are going to see the baltic pippen versus the spanish pistol
6892248 any time you go to the rim and they have a chance to lay some wood on you they will
6892249 they have made some unforced errors here that have allowed spain to hang in the ball game
6892250 it came down to spains will and style of play and in the end it was the finesse ball and player movement that prevailed against the heavy physical play of lithuania
6892251 alberto cisolla and italy all over brazil to start three hitting errors by giba theyve been aced they have looked ill at ease and italy just rolling right along but it is awfully awfully early
6892252 italy has typically played a very technical very pure form of volleyball
6892253 italy shocks brazil in the opening set taking it easily 25 19 well see how brazil responds
6892254 andrea anastasi realizes that the momentum and the emotion of this match is quickly slipping away and calls a very smart time out
6892255 this is a terrible sign for an already depleted italian side
6892256 thats just awful to see luigi mastrangelo in his 3rd olympic games
6892257 italy came in with injury problems and theyve just gotten a bit worse
6892258 they team usa can expect another knock down drag out match
6892259 brazil looking to repeat as olympic champions the united states will be looking to win their first gold medal in 20 years

6892265 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
6892266 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes

6892337 a lot of times a person does not know exactly what he or she is searching for and needs to continually tweak the query
6892338 this is becoming a real pain point for large companies today with a decade or more of content in legacy knowledge bases new information from best of breed knowledge bases and now exploding libraries of customer created content in discussion forums
6892339 older search tools use text matching so customers who use different terminology than the company standard may never find a solution in the knowledge base concept analysis understands what customers or agents are searching for at a concept level regardless of wording terminology or spelling

6892377 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6892378 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6892379 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6892380 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6892381 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling

6892383 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6892384 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6892385 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6892386 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site

6892388 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6892389 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6892390 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic

6892399 this means spokane is getting a brand new seminary which is generally unheard of
6892400 its odd to drive by sharp and see it in a different spot
6892401 i got a hat and gloves last year and i love them i still use them
6892402 i thought it was things that students left behind when they went home
6892403 this is one of the greatest opportunities i have ever had and i hope that i can use my experiences to further the world of science
6892404 it has been a powerful transformation to see these kids go from being students to scientists
6892405 it really hasnt had a comprehensive renovation in 40 years
6892406 were going to have a new ornate ceiling pendant lights a renovated ticket booth and new molding
6892407 the theme is a water based theme meant to show incoming students the connectivity of our area namely the spokane river with the rest of the northwest and also the ability for students to jump into school and immediately feel part of the gonzaga community
6892408 we hope the water theme will encourage students to think about their environmental impact while enjoying wonderful activities that orientation the gonzaga community and spokane have to offer
6892409 orientation made me see that there were so many other people not just myself who were also feeling excitement and fear about the transition to college
6892410 in that realization i felt connected to the gonzaga community
6892411 one goal of the freshman summer reading program is the experience of reading it then interacting in the environment of the book and sharing a common experience with your peers

6892420 you watch gu games during the season and then you are here
6892421 gonzaga was one of the best teams and he only wanted to play for the best
6892422 he felt strongly about being a first round pick because thats where the guaranteed money is which is a wise choice
6892423 in the second round youre not guaranteed money and you have to make a team
6892424 his brother was instrumental because he had been through the process i told him to be patient and get the right people around him to look for the truth and disregard the people on the edges who dont know as much
6892425 he did great he talked to all the right people got the information straight from the source the nba coaches and made an educated decision
6892426 i told him to do whats right for him because when its all said and done his decision impacts him the most
6892427 i had a coach tell me once the worst day in baseball is better than any other day for anybody else i just try to keep that mentality and play like i am kid again

6892447 vamos a suspender eso porque lleg gente a provocar incidentes y queremos evitar problemas el objetivo era dar a conocer la placa y darle a conocer a nicaragua quienes fueron esos muchachos h roes
6892448 hoy por la noche parece que les van a dar un reconocimiento lo cual nos alegra much simo de forma que damos por concluida nuestra tarea sobre el reconocimiento de esos hombres que integraron el comando rigoberto l pez p rez
6892449 parece ser que hay algunas personas que tienen una mentalidad obtusa y no comprenden que los hechos de la historia no se pueden borrar a las personas que participaron en esa acci n no se pueden borrar
6892450 si te caen mal o bien las personas que parciparon en el operativo que llev a la toma del congreso nacional pues necesariamente ten s que ver esa fotograf a tal a como ocurrieron los hechos
6892451 se nos qued uno que no pudo participar porque era muy chiquito se qued en mi casa porque no le qued el uniforme ra demasiado grande para l
6892452 nadie sab a que los bamos a sacar de las c rceles somocistas y desde la c rcel nos escrib an que no nos junt ramos con fulano y zutano hab an muchos recelos lo que a nosotros nos daba risa
6892453 lo que fue el acto hist rico m s un nime que ha tenido esta naci n en toda su historia y la nica vez que todo el mundo estuvo de acuerdo en algo como bueno como positivo y sembr las bases para seguir venciendo la ignorancia
6892454 nos sentimos orgullosos en la alcald a de managua de haber podido ser coadyuvantes para que managua llegara a obtener la calificaci n de cero en analfabetismo menos del 3 por ciento que es el ndice de la unesco logro que puede parecer simple pero tiene un gran valor porque se hizo con miles de personas voluntarias que prestaron sus casas su tiempo para poderles ense ar a leer a otras personas
6892455 no podemos quedarnos con cero analfabetismo porque ahora las autoridades del ministerio de educaci n tienen programas para darle seguimiento a esto y poder continuar avanzando
6892456 as logramos ir terminando con el analfabetismo en los seis distritos de la capital
6892457 managua es la primera capital de toda centroam rica libre de analfabetismo
6892458 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6892459 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6892460 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6892461 tem que ser grande o suficiente para caber todos os amigos dela e para assustar os outros carros ao redor
6892462 sou uma boa motorista mas com os outros que me preocupo
6892463 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6892464 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6892465 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6892466 what whyd you put it down in the first place
6892467 in wireless gaming and wireless apps panoramic software inc has put together the worlds top smartphone games and applications and have made them easily accessible to everyone our search technology displays an entire category of mobile software in an easy to view flow menu with each product description listed instantly combined these innovations allow for a first rate shopping experience
6892468 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6892469 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6892470 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6892471 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6892472 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6892473 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6892474 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6892475 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6892476 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6892477 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6892478 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6892479 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6892480 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6892481 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6892482 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6892483 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6892484 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6892485 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6892486 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6892487 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6892488 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6892489 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6892490 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6892491 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6892492 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6892493 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6892494 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6892495 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6892496 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6892497 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6892498 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6892499 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6892500 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6892501 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6892502 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6892503 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6892504 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6892505 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6892506 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6892507 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6892508 the narcotics checkpoints main objective was to get the narcotics off of the street
6892509 anything off of the streets is not in the hands of kids or anyone else
6892510 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6892511 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6892512 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6892513 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6892514 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6892515 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6892516 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6892517 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6892518 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6892519 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6892520 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6892521 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6892522 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6892523 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6892524 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6892525 the initial impression of this circus was somewhat promising until the marquee lit up the farcical exhibit was nothing more than a marketing vehicle in brand recognition for peterson walker and novelli all of whom are fully involved in the servicenation national servitude movement and their upcoming summit in nyc on sept 11 12 as expected mcbama will be headlining and any reference to the memory hole will be obliterated
6892526 in one fordham university study 122 students in fifth sixth and seventh grades were asked to think out loud for 20 minutes while playing a game they had never seen before researchers studied the childrens statements to see if playing the game improved cognitive and perceptual skills
6892527 serious video games can aid training for real world emergencies
6892528 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6892529 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6892530 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6892531 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6892532 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6892533 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6892534 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6892535 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6892536 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6892537 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6892538 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6892539 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6892540 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6892541 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6892542 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6892543 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6892544 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6892545 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6892546 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6892547 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6892548 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6892549 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6892550 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6892551 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6892552 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6892553 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6892554 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6892555 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6892556 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6892557 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6892558 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6892559 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6892560 this is a planning took where all things are going
6892561 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6892562 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6892563 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6892564 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6892565 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6892566 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6892567 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6892568 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6892569 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6892570 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6892571 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6892572 i just read the posts about iousa i am quite familiar with bonner and wiggins work and went to see the film because they were involved i was quite disappointed not so much surprised but disappointed
6892573 it started out ok with an amusing clip with steve martin
6892574 there was also an unintentionally amusing part later they portrayed bill clinton as an heroic paragon of fiscal responsibility which caused a significant portion of the theater to literally laugh out loud
6892575 the theme for the movie can be summed up in one section
6892576 i know ricky will be as good a papi as he is a dancer
6892577 ricky is a very giving person and will make a wonderful parent
6892578 i would love to have children of my own because i know i can offer them a good life
6892579 il y a deux ans s gol ne royal avait fait le voyage rome avec la m me ferveur

6892582 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6892583 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6892584 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6892585 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6892586 my wife is going with me and weve never been to anything like this
6892587 we got a sneak peak in the pepsi center the other day
6892588 that stage they got set up is a video technophile dream
6892589 we need to energize the glbt community behind jeff merkley for senate
6892590 gordon did some good things like the hate crimes bill but he supported the marriage amendment that defined marriage as well so theres no comparison between the two candidates if we can galvanize support from the glbt community this is absolutely critical
6892591 i have less responsibility but all the access thats the way i look at it
6892592 obama has so much to offer and the alternative is unthinkable
6892593 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6892594 we have found him of whom moses in the law and also the prophets wrote
6892595 behold an israelite indeed in whom there is no deceit
6892596 rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel
6892597 truly truly i say to you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending on the son of man
6892598 just you wait mr nathanael youll see me reunite heaven and earth that is god and sinners
6892599 t he history of the saints may be set before us so that we may follow the example of their faith and good works according to our calling
6892600 they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death although he had done no violence and there was no deceit in his mouth
6892601 was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed
6892602 grant that your church may love what bartholomew believed and preach what he taught
6892603 this product is important in that it offers a new approach to the treatment of patients with an uncommon blood disorder who are often very ill
6892604 until now there have been limited fda approved treatments available to patients suffering from chronic adult itp and the treatment options were often unsuccessful for long term use
6892605 less than or comparable to the total costs of care with standard treatment regimens
6892606 it doesnt take a lot youre not going to see it
6892607 its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances

6892623 general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease
6892624 were asked to report about their feelings prior to diagnosis
6892625 experiencing more than one meaningful life event severe and or mild to moderate is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6892626 repeated retrieval of already stored events may add new information as facts and thus events are re stored in the brain in an altered fashion
6892627 people with a disease tend to think harder about their prior exposures than disease free people
6892628 the presence of disease is presumed to act as a stimulus that affects both the patients perception of the causes and his search for possible exposure to a hypothesized risk factor
6892629 research including reported data about past experiences will always be threatened by the limitations of the individuals memory and the influence of disease exposure status on the recalling process in humans
6892630 no support for the hypothesis that negative emotional well being predicts poorer survival
6892631 ive read all about this if you got cancer you must have wanted it
6892632 ive been told that my personality must have caused my cancer and i guess i just didnt handle stress right in my life
6892633 i know i have to be positive all the time and that is the only way to cope with cancer but its so hard to do i know that if i get sad or scared or upset i am making my tumor grow faster and i will have shortened my life
6892634 it is important that people know that research simply does not back up these ideas
6892635 well it couldnt happen to me it was his own fault
6892636 dont believe that you have to have a positive attitude all the time and that sadness or worry will shorten your survival

6892640 the reason teams from utpa are successful time and time again in national competitions is due to our secret weapon our students they possess what the judges in this competition describe as the key factor to success heart
6892641 i was very happy and satisfied that all our hard work paid off
6892642 he gave us a lot of feedback but he was also our toughest critic and that prepared us for any question any comment

6892644 it gives you tools for your future career it exposes you to the real world of corporate accountants and shows you what you need to have to succeed
6892645 the teams success also raises the awareness of the university of texas pan american and its talented students among thousands of business professionals and educators from across the country
6892646 and its a really good first step in having staff listen to developers concerns and restructure financial agreements without overburdening the village
6892647 they trump everything we were paying for a yugo under the old agreement now were getting a cadillac
6892648 this will go a long way in changing the bad reputation that sugar grove has in working with developers
6892649 its what christopher shays has always stood for he goes where the truth takes him
6892650 its not what is republican or democrat its whats right for america
6892651 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house
6892652 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington

6892744 we believe that raids on the immigrant community are unjust unnecessary and counterproductive
6892745 would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6892746 i thought for sure it would pass and then someone on the metrolink campaign made the decision to advertise that the train would connect mid rivers mall with east st louis
6892747 i know it s not politically correct but how else do you explain it
6892748 anyone can see all these people crossing brentwood boulevard from the metrolink station
6892749 most of them aren t here to shop they re here to hang out and cause trouble
6892750 it s not as bad as it used to be on the weekends
6892751 but come here any weekday while school is in session
6892752 what we do for the galleria is take them their employees and shoppers
6892753 with the loop incidents we and our passengers were the victims these kids aren t traveling there by metro they re coming by car or walking they re not coming by metro
6892754 we used to hang out in the galleria but when metrolink opened it got too crazy there
6892755 then more and more people started coming now it s a lot of the same people from the galleria who hang out in the loop it s like you have two groups there are people like us and then there are the dropouts i don t know where or if they go school but they re ruining it for all of us
6892756 we definitely noticed an upswing but to us it really doesn t matter why they re here
6892757 our concern is that they behave themselves which for teenagers is sometimes hard to do
6892758 they streamed by our windows for fifteen minutes the university city police had a k 9 unit out pushing the kids along and it s a good thing in my opinion these kids are ruining the neighborhood you can t walk the loop without getting hassled by them they clog the sidewalks and won t get out of the way i ve heard numerous reports of them jumping innocent people
6892759 i can tell you that when we arrived the crowd just scattered
6892760 i don t know if they ran to metrolink or what but i do know that several people were assaulted and that bothers me we re not going to take it
6892761 i don t care what color you are you need to behave
6892762 i don t want this blown out of proportion but it needs to be addressed
6892763 i think that s a bit of a knee jerk reaction
6892764 the connotation with that theory is that metrolink brings urban black youth into richmond heights to commit these crimes that s not what i m seeing in court we re prosecuting blacks and whites
6892765 then their friends follow behind them stuffing merchandise into the bag as they walk through the racks
6892766 he s a repeat offender we ve caught him in here stealing numerous times
6892767 that s the way we re supposed to do it
6892768 how are they going to kick me out of the mall it s racist

6892826 this is a very bad time to sell a newspaper company

6892829 i think there is almost no chance of a major media company buying the ajc
6892830 most acquisition executives in the business now feel that the metropolitan american newspaper is the most vulnerable of all the types of newspapers that we have
6892831 there are very few industries private equity wouldnt look at
6892832 even though newspapers arent a growth industry and they might be shrinking there is still cash flow there private equity might believe they could get a return on newspapers
6892833 there are people who have a true interest in what a major metro newspaper means to a city i think that even non journalists look at the role of the ajc in atlanta as absolutely essential to good government and good business
6892834 a big market newspaper despite the doom and gloom in the industry will always attract other companies or local groups or a local person with a lot of money

6892840 companies cant simply hand off the work of e discovery to their outside counsel they have to oversee it and they have to be involved because theyre going to be on the hook

6892844 but since then its swelled to a flood back then i wouldve said the volume of such evidence was about zero terabytes now we see tens of terabytes of documents in languages other than english
6892845 it means you can recognize unicode in files but thats just a starting point when extracting data your search software has to actually understand those languages and how theyre written
6892846 its more important that an e discovery company can say that it is safe harbor certified than anything
6892847 when american parties start doing e discovery outside of the u s they prefer to do it there because they are often leery of the usa patriot act
6892848 its unclear whether by bringing data into the u s the u s government can subpoena it

6892855 there is now incontrovertible evidence that marketing of tobacco and the depiction of smoking in the movies promote youth smoking and can cause young people to begin smoking
6892856 the role of the media in promoting and reducing tobacco use
6892857 the role of marketing in the success of the tobacco companies is conclusive
6892858 the reports recommendations offer the best approach to employ marketing techniques and the media to help prevent a further increase in youth smoking
6892859 this direct link between marketing and tobacco use is very powerful
6892860 anti tobacco ads before films and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising are two effective strategies found to curb effects of tobacco images on youth now we need to use marketing to steer youth and others away from tobacco

6892885 confronta il tuo cuore con il mio il mio perfetto mentre il tuo un rattoppo di ferite e lacrime
6892886 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai cambio con il mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio affetto ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ne ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi cos ho qualche bitorzolo a cui sono affezionato per ciascuno mi ricorda laffetto che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini amare rischioso certo ma per quante dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che provo anke per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo comprendi adesso che cosa sia la vera bellezza

6892895 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6892896 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6892897 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6892898 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6892899 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6892900 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6892901 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor

6892972 we have these fake queues in front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6892973 the aim was to warm up the atmosphere around the launch of the iphone
6892974 if youre as antique as i am you may recall that when the beatles first came to america they premiered on the ed sullivan show

6892977 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood

6892984 a special purpose circuit takes power from a regular wall outlet and uses that to excite electric currents in the source antenna those currents generate electromagnetic fields and the device antenna captures some of the power contained in them and feeds it to the gadget that one is interested in powering
6892985 in order for this scheme to be efficient when the source and device are separated by some distance its necessary that both antennas be resonant at the same frequency and that they be carefully designed so that roughly speaking they transfer power among themselves faster than they dissipate it
6892986 i think portable devices would get a larger boost in convenience from wireless power
6892987 iphone has received different feedback from consumers in different markets the kind of response it has in different economies around the world are related to the marketing strategies used to generate interest in the phone
6892988 it was a good move it is better to have people who can attract people greet them and talk to them about what the iphone is and the cool features of the product to at least grab some attention
6892989 its just a marketing initiative the market in america is so different the need to do that here is unnecessary but there they were aware that not a whole lot of people were going to show up when it comes to marketing it depends on what segment of the market youre dealing with every country has a different setup altogether it may not have been the best strategy but i would not call it silly

6893071 there is a lot more gratitude for each other and for the gifts we have to write and play music
6893072 we have been blessed with the ability to strap guitars on our backs get on a plane and go play a show anywhere in the country
6893073 that is the career i always hoped we would have
6893074 i love the universal theme that is in the lyrics of
6893075 they can tell us a lot about whats happening out in the ocean that we cant physically see here
6893076 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet

6893083 people say that the savage no longer exists in us that we are at the fag end of civilization that everything has been said already and that it is too late to be ambitious but these philosophers have presumably forgotten the movies they have never seen the savages of the twentieth century watching the pictures
6893084 it looks like hes got some decent numbers against left handers and hey were going to run into a few here and there including saturday versus jon lester he can play third he can play second and he can play the outfield
6893085 along with having a little back problem as far as muscle spasms and things like that his arm has been bothering him too
6893086 but the muscle spasm issue is whats keeping him out of the lineup

6893089 when i grow up i want to be a cooker
6893090 what i think about the world in which i find myself
6893091 if there is a shortfall it will affect states that have a larger federal program
6893092 so we are concerned but montanas not alone in this
6893093 for the first time were seeing that revenue flatten out
6893094 what came along in this whole thing which i dont think a lot of people expected was gas running up from 2 50 to 4 00 a gallon
6893095 it doesnt bode well for highway infrastructure or for employment
6893096 we dont think the rural states will be affected in the near term
6893097 come october 1 2009 its going to be a brave new world
6893098 what we have now has worked fine but its not going to take us much farther
6893099 this movement is just like when you are using a sword it confuses your opponent
6893100 okay everybody watch noguchi noguchi teach jungle style laughs this movement is like a big bear
6893101 rossellini had interest creating a series of little films about how different bugs mate and robert redford has continued in the theme of his eco friendly programming for the channel
6893102 inspired by the amazing and often bizarre sexual practices of insects and other creatures these 8 films are both comical and insightful studies of the curious ways a variety of earths tiny critters make love
6893103 so how did the glamour icon get into the insect porn business
6893104 oh itd be great to do a series of little films about how different bugs mate
6893105 if i were a fly id have these eyes id have this id have that
6893106 theres bad ways to lead a discussion and this is one of them
6893107 im not sure if this is what youre driving at but
6893108 it is because you normally train with only one partner that you forget there could be any number against you
6893109 this is not a block use your spirit to immobilize your opponent
6893110 everyone has this spookiness within him you must learn to release it to control the situation
6893111 people who do not care for their children do not have a right to the future those who do not care for their elderly do not have a right to their history
6893112 aqu no se juzga un accidente sino la tragedia evitable m s grande de la historia judicial argentina
6893113 y esperamos con este juicio poder mostrar su causa la corrupci n
6893114 esperamos que se juzgue una l gica la l gica croma n donde se privilegia el negocio por sobre la vida y se cuida m s la propiedad que a las personas
6893115 este es un juicio incompleto nunca va a estar lo suficientemente completo porque el primero que deber a estar an bal ibarra fue sobrese do por razones pol ticas y porque la corporaci n judicial o al menos una parte sigui protegi ndolo
6893116 lo fundamental para nosotros son los funcionarios acusados que son los que permitieron a todos los dem s hacer lo que hicieron un escaloncito debajo est n los polic as y luego el grupo chab n y villarreal
6893117 para nosotros lo central es que se entienda que hay una consigna en las marchas que es literalmente cierta a los pibes no los mat ni la bengala ni el rock los mat la corrupci n el lucro desmedido es corrupci n el sistema que participa de esas ganancias es corrupci n y la coima directa es corrupci n directa
6893118 estuvimos con el fiscal y de pronto nos dice parece que para ustedes fuera m s importante ibarra que chab n ni lo hab amos hablado entre nosotros pero le dijimos que por supuesto porque chab n es un empresario uno puede querer que hubiera otra clase de empresarios pero ibarra era el estado entonces o cuid s a la gente o no me vendas que lo vas a hacer no es que no queremos condena para chab n sino que no somos tontos no queremos que le den 50 a os a chab n y que los funcionarios queden exonerados eso ser a una mentira
6893119 ella por su manejo con los negocios de la noche y hay gente que est procesada y espera el 2 juicio oral como juan carlos l pez ex secretario de seguridad o rafael levy
6893120 nosotros tomamos esto como el primer cap tulo de una novela larga pero existe una corporaci n judicial que pretende que sea el ltimo cap tulo
6893121 croma n es un mal ejemplo que se puede expandir hay una corporaci n judicial e incluyo en lo que digo a la corte suprema que tiene una concepci n aristocr tica del poder judicial ellos son los cortesanos y el pueblo son los s bditos pero resulta que los s bditos andan medio subversivos y hay que cuidarse de ellos que somos todos nosotros
6893122 todos hablan mucho pero en la pr ctica se hace poco aqu la consigna es adaptarse a lo que hay y callarse la boca
6893123 primero los abogados bamos a estar del otro lado del blindex reci n lo pudimos solucionar a ltimo momento
6893124 lo loco es que croma n est planteado como un juicio de alta peligrosidad pero los peligrosos somos nosotros los familiares
6893125 uno de ellos le dijeron a la jueza mar a ang lica crotto que los chicos desde el cielo la iban a castigar entonces ella los denunci a los padres por amenaza agravada yo me qued pensando que yo tendr a que haberla denunciado a ella en su momento
6893126 nos dijo que ten amos que hacer el duelo con nuestros hijos igual que ella lo hizo cuando le extirparon un tumor
6893127 fue de las que entr varias veces a sacar gente y declar haber visto el momento de pago de coimas por parte de chab n a la polic a
6893128 entr cuatro veces pero era imposible llegar a los ba os por el humo que no te dejaba respirar pude sacar s lo a algunas personas que estaban a mi alcance
6893129 para mi nunca se pudo recuperar del humo que aspir
6893130 era una testigo clave y lo raro es que no te puedan dar una explicaci n convincente
6893131 la funci n que tiene el derecho penal en las sociedades modernas si es que todav a tiene alguna es que hay normas que cumplir y si no hay un castigo
6893132 a partir de lo ocurrido en rep blica de croma n el 30 12 2004 que dej un saldo de 194 personas muertas la mayor a j venes y miles de sobrevivientes con secuelas de distinta ndole se crearon y alimentaron numerosos mitos
6893133 dont try to do everything yourself you are part of a team so learn to work together to anticipate each others intentions and actions
6893134 if you see a dog follow it it knows the way and will lead you
6893135 lets go through this persons property im sure well end up somewhere
6893136 its what christopher shays has always stood for he goes where the truth takes him
6893137 its not what is republican or democrat its whats right for america
6893138 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house
6893139 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
6893140 not getting anything done because i am taking too long to decide what to use
6893141 ive observed mr long in situations that would be trying to just about anyone
6893142 he seemed to me to be extremely poised and lucid
6893143 i feel the war on terror is a war on peace
6893144 the morality of what he did should lessen the punishment
6893145 i can only think of two or three people who have that kind of money in our community
6893146 the great enterprise the manchu reconstruction of imperial order in seventeenth century china
6893147 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
6893148 if you re in the navy and you re on a ship and you have access to the internet you can see how your child is doing in school
6893149 it will make it easier for students to understand and make sure teachers are providing the best means of learning to students
6893150 we want to put interventions in place to improve their scores
6893151 it s a three tier project to get to the strongest readers to those with difficulties and get them to a reading level above what they re currently at
6893152 i think that parents should be confident in the fact that our schools are going to provide their children with a quality education
6893153 it s always a challenge to get them back not only at the games but at the pta meetings and most importantly at the school improvement leadership meetings so they can have a voice in what s happening in the schools
6893154 now when school kicks in on aug 25 they will be ready and the new people will have a little bit of an edge in terms of orientation
6893155 those companies have raised prices and you have bernanke saying he expects inflation to ease and commodity prices to decline
6893156 if thats the case then companies like procter amp gamble are going to have higher margins they raised prices because of higher commodity costs but that doesnt mean theyre going to lower them when costs go down
6893157 you declined to enter into a customary confidentiality agreement that would enable us to have an orderly evaluation process and ensure that we are able to protect the long term interests of our shareholders
6893158 what this offer does is put the company in play
6893159 it was clearly too low to be attractive and now that its in play the anticipation is that others will step forward with a more attractive offer
6893160 we continue to prefer to work together with you and your board to complete a negotiated transaction and we are prepared to commit all necessary resources to do so if we are unable to negotiate a transaction we are prepared to take this offer directly to your stockholders
6893161 this is a stab to make itself king the dominant player in the pain management business in a hurry
6893162 i think its a very good strategic move for it
6893163 it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business
6893164 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6893165 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6893166 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6893167 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
6893168 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
6893169 there has never been a year where i didn t close at least one school
6893170 we are looking forward to all three of those events
6893171 we ve been used to closing schools i enjoy seeing new schools a lot more than lowering flags for the final time
6893172 i m looking forward to the new school year and all indications are that we are off to a smooth start
6893173 initially registration was going slow but has picked up tremendously dodds e is now registering 400 students a day
6893174 everything we ve implemented in the past two or three years is in place
6893175 if you walk down the bus lines like i do every year on the first day of school you ll mostly see smiles
6893176 i dnt no who the fuk u think u dealin wit u will neva be heard from one phone call is all i gotta make no try me sho me
6893177 an unsolicited vulgar and offensive illustration of a man physically restraining a woman while forcing her to engage in sexual intercourse with him
6893178 it has certainly been the case that the general aim for most airlines is to put fares up in order to recoup high fuel costs any deviation from that general approach raises concerns that demand is softening in the face of slower economic growth
6893179 this reduction in ticket prices will be all the more welcome for consumers for being so unexpected
6893180 ba cannot absorb the increase in oil prices fares are going to have to go up
6893181 to over 90 long and short haul destinations in economy and business classes with upgrades to premium economy
6893182 the airline bosses have been pleading impending poverty for months
6893183 perhaps demand is softening quicker than they expected or maybe they want the security of cash in the bank so that by next april they have a better idea of how much they have to spend on hedging fuel
6893184 if ever there was a time to win back the brits who have been tempted abroad by the budget airlines it is now
6893185 soaring air fares an overpowering euro and the credit crunch are changing holiday habits this summer and maybe for good if we can provide quality accommodation low prices and fantastic attractions we can turn this opportunity into a lasting tourism legacy
6893186 its not mccains wealth per se because we dont resent the rich we want to be them
6893187 the issue becomes out of touch we want presidents who get what the average american is dealing with
6893188 we may have to paddle our canoes on our own
6893189 seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6893190 the pacific island countries will need to be vigilant to protect the forum organisation from becoming a foreign policy tool of these two countries they now seem to have usurped the moral leadership of the region
6893191 i think its plain insulting to say that what happened yesterday is a manipulation by new zealand and australia the truth is fiji has run out of anyone prepared to hold the brief for it because of the contempt in which it had held the forum particularly by not turning up this time
6893192 this year and the years ahead we must grow more vegetable and staple crops such as rice cassava dalo bhindi bhaji and yams the government will also encourage the development of renewable energy sources such as biofuel solar and hydro electric energy
6893193 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years thank you for your service as being an ex marine but that doesnt mean youre not an idiot and he is
6893194 oh hey could you hold on a sec my mum just wants to talk with me
6893195 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6893196 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6893197 somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6893198 the united states and ghana enjoy warm relations and a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity in africa and throughout the world
6893199 the two presidents will discuss efforts to combat malaria and neglected tropical diseases as well as ghanas efforts to promote democratic values peace and stability in africa
6893200 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6893201 if youre doing something like image processing we can demonstrate six to seven times speed ups and we can probably double those
6893202 if youre doing a tight programming loop thats just manipulating bits you can go 20 to 40 times faster
6893203 what were trying to do is extend the capability of the browser
6893204 if browsers are only doing javascript and doing it slowly we worry that content will migrate to closed platforms like silverlight
6893205 those platforms that are not a browser are an increasingly thin value add to what the browser can do
6893206 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow when i got back i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6893207 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so thought i would give it a shot and see if it works

6893209 and after this trip ill have seen just about every stadium of the four major us sports

6893259 investigates the role of the saudi arabian religious establishment in spreading a hard line fundamentalist islamic ideology in the uk the very ideology the government claims to be tackling
6893260 preachers proclaim the supremacy of islam preach hatred for non muslims and for muslims who do not follow their extreme beliefs and predict a coming jihad
6893261 i was appalled by some of the things we saw it must be investigated i want to know what this stuff was and why it took a tv documentary to expose it the mosque must know what is happening inside its building
6893262 its deeply disturbing that this preaching of hate is still going on there should be a further investigation into the bookshop and what these people are preaching

6893265 it is just amazing that while polar bears are fighting for their lives the governor of alaska is spending the states money trying to overturn protection for the species and congress is talking about opening new areas to oil development

6893268 most new vehicle buyers are unaware of phevs in particular and are confused about electric drive terminology commonly used by experts
6893269 we estimate that about a third of the target population has both the infrastructure to recharge a phev and interest in a vehicle with plug in capabilities
6893270 widespread phev use could halve gasoline use impacts to the electricity grid could highly depend on the time of day and location recharge management strategy while unconstrained recharging among phev buyers may exacerbate current peak electricity demand pushing vehicle recharging to off peak hours through charging controls time of day tariffs or other means could reduce overall electricity used by vehicles

6893278 iphone has received different feedback from consumers in different markets the kind of response it has in different economies around the world are related to the marketing strategies used to generate interest in the phone
6893279 it was a good move it is better to have people who can attract people greet them and talk to them about what the iphone is and the cool features of the product to at least grab some attention
6893280 its just a marketing initiative the market in america is so different the need to do that here is unnecessary but there they were aware that not a whole lot of people were going to show up when it comes to marketing it depends on what segment of the market youre dealing with every country has a different setup altogether it may not have been the best strategy but i would not call it silly

6893298 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6893299 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century from countries like iran or from north korea
6893300 theres a large labor force very close to us in east timor and in the region and we need to find ways where we can have a win for east timor provide some support there as well as fill a need here
6893301 however we must never reduce our effort to bridge that gap from welfare to work here
6893302 fruit picking is one of the very few jobs for which they can qualify because in the northern territory particularly youve got 10 000 young men and women who cannot read write or count because of the northern territory aboriginal education
6893303 its something that they could do in the northern territory but they dont have the backbone or the will to do it in other parts of the country
6893304 its true that the education system has not served our remote indigenous australian well but turning people into unskilled labourers is not the answer

6893309 if there is a view that for various political reasons we should not be there or what we are trying to do should be altered which cannot be then we would necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we need to move
6893310 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore we will not move then they are wrong we would move whatever the cost to protect our people what has concerned us is the violence and the disruption that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and of the viability of the entire process
6893311 compound walls are being broken materials stolen you cannot open and operate a plant with police protection
6893312 please understand that i am making a very genuine statement and i do not have a motive
6893313 great loss to the company its shareholders and west bengal
6893314 we came at a time when there was very little investment coming to west bengal and the tata motors decided to locate one of their prime and most unique factory in west bengal we wanted to showcase the new industrialisation of west bengal
6893315 we leased property which was offered to us that had been acquired and as we were looking for a unique product with low cost we wanted an integrated location as logistics and transportation are major components of cost for any project we are trying to produce a car that has never been tried anywhere in the world at that kind of price
6893316 we do not want anyone to go away from bengal
6893317 india is not a member of the nsg so any such statement of principle by us would clearly not be binding on them
6893318 i think this is one issue the nsg is likely to back away from if the u s comes back in september and says india will simply not agree to this
6893319 what needs to be looked at is how to deal with the new situation which would be created were india to test again
6893320 we have been discussing this for years even before the india issue came along so some countries have suggested our india decision postpone a waiver on enr pending a final revision of the nsgs guidelines on this
6893321 some countries are suggesting having some kind of monitoring mechanism to assess the extent to which india is abiding by its non proliferation commitments
6893322 i think it also needs to be emphasised that none of the countries which raised these objections were saying no we should not be doing this for india
6893323 we hope to impress upon our high command that the samiti has the unconditional support of all sections of the people of jammu
6893324 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure

6893326 mr tata are you listening to me land at singur has been forcibly acquired please accept the advice of the people of the area and return the 400 acres to the farmers we are pleading for both industry and agriculture so that people in industry and agriculture can smile
6893327 there is still a solution to the stalemate we have a one point programme let there be agriculture as well as industry
6893328 whatever benefits have been given to the tatas should be given to other industrialists there are so many industrialists why just one
6893329 did they not know then that the congress had seen electoral reverses in some states was the defeat of the congress in some states the real reason for the marxists to withdraw their support was the nuclear deal issue a manufactured reason
6893330 place the matter inflation and base year effect in perspective
6893331 headline inflation continues to be a matter of concern the point to be stressed is that the inflation rate for each group in the wpi is measured on an annual point to point basis hence it is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6893332 this trend of a declining wpi continued up to november 24 2007
6893333 it is the movement of prices of these items that are impacting the prices of primary articles

6893508 if i say to myself its unbearable then the outcome will be unhealthy anger but if i accept and observe my feelings by saying yes of course i would prefer not to wait so long but this isnt as bad as some things that could happen to me then it will be a healthier frustration that will enable me to use the time more productively

6893511 i live in the smallest house ive ever had i have a tiny garden but within a few minutes is a playground and a park if you get trapped in earning a lot of money just so you can buy things you are not going to be spending much time with the people you love the secret is about embracing living with less

6893518 my children walk to school and i walk to work i hardly ever use the car and although i am working full time i feel so much more relaxed because i am not permanently rushing and stuck in traffic my health and my stress levels are so much better

6893565 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6893566 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time

6893590 not a single house will remain on the face of the earth unpenetrated by islam
6893591 iran is oppressed in the nuclear case the bullying powers use the issue as an excuse to settle their accounts with the islamic revolution of iran
6893592 nuclear energy is absolute right of iranian people they the bullying powers too believe that iran can master peaceful nuclear technology the world big powers tough approach towards iran which has by reliance on its power and technology been able to reach a position to have peaceful nuclear industry under conditions of sanctions is an injustice to both the country and mankind
6893593 the problem has gone to the extent that today most states have made recourse to use of coal energy
6893594 despite restoration of calm it the case is not yet over under such cases one should act more rationally and prudently
6893595 globalization will only be realized when the days of the mahdi come the world of arrogance will take its dream of globalization to the grave but in the days of the mahdi real globalization will definitely come to pass
6893596 god sent his messenger in order to spread the just religion so that his religion islam would overcome all other religions
6893597 by overcome i am not referring to the superiority of the logic of islam because in this sense it is already superior
6893598 not a single house will remain on the face of the earth
6893599 the claim that the time has passed when one religion ruled the world runs counter to the koran and the islamic tradition not only has the time not passed but the islamic revival that we are witnessing today is moving in this direction and allah willing
6893600 is it appropriate for some government officials to say that we are friends of the people of israel and that the people in america are the best in mass communications this wording is absolutely wrong
6893601 the israeli people are the ones who ignite the fire of battle of their country
6893602 the person who made this statement should retract it quickly and should ask the great iranian nation to forgive him for taking such an inappropriate position and not say that he would repeat it 1 000 times
6893603 during the 33 day war in lebanon the israelis told their people that if they experience psychological problems because of hizbullahs rockets they could visit certain doctors people did go to see these doctors but they found that the doctors were much worse off psychologically now you want to confront iran rest assured that if you are stupid and take action against iran the response of iran will drive you utterly insane
6893604 one of the trustworthy comrades a prominent and well known figure whose name need not be disclosed told me that about four years ago i
6893605 at the hospital he waited for an hour while the woman fetched her daughter and the baby and then they all got into the car whereupon the baby spoke saying may peace allahs mercy and his blessing be upon you they replied to the baby peace be upon you
6893606 as the comrade told us and as we allah be thanked relayed to sheikh nizar and other scholars and great sheikhs the newborn infant enunciated i am the man whom the anti christ will kill whereupon no one will rule either over or after me
6893607 at this point the tv host asked the comrade is the child being watched over
6893608 with this utterance quoted here verbatim his eminence sheikh issa badwan ended the interview with al aqsa tv and whoever wishes to hear or see it for himself must follow the link below to ascertain that i am not twisting facts or maligning either the al aqsa satellite channel or sheikh issa badwan
6893609 you should not find it difficult to bear the suffering for another 16 years especially since this period of waiting for the mahdi to appear will be followed by great jubilation and incredible victories
6893610 sheikh issa badwan vouched for the veracity of this story which was conveyed to him by a well known prominent and trustworthy figure
6893611 the anti christ will kill him when he is between 18 and 20 years old as is stated in the
6893612 accordingly insofar as the palestinians the arabs and the muslims have suffered greatly during the 60 years since the palestinian nakba or during the 532 years from the time of the liberation of granada from the arab occupiers
6893613 sheikh issa there are several points that require clarification firstly how will constantinople be conquered you said that the appearance of the long awaited mahdi and as you have declared he did indeed appear four years ago will be preceded by the conquest of rome italy and constantinople the city of constantinople was conquered in 1453 ce by the muslim ottoman empire whereupon its name was changed to istanbul and its greatest church aya sophia became a mosque how will constantinople be actually conquered if for 555 years it has already been under the muslim turkish rule
6893614 wake up stay up do your work or pay the piper
6893615 ms flower could you stop by my office during your planning period a parent is requesting a conference etc etc
6893616 well i wont write those exact words but ill make the point

6893619 editorial decisions are a regular part of the process this wasnt for us we had no problem with rachel posting it elsewhere
6893620 we have issues and we are trying to deal with them
6893621 we are still working on achieving our mutual objectives whatever hurdles are there we will try to get over them
6893622 study details how u s could cut 28 of greenhouse gases
6893623 what makes you think your mom sleeps all day long
6893624 because shes still up at 2 or 3 in the morning and then shes banging on my door at a quarter to six that would mean she only gets a couple hours of sleep a night nobody can do that and stay alive
6893625 so she must be sleeping during the day while were all at school
6893626 yeah but that just started this week and besides she doesnt teach all day just part of it she only has to show up at like eleven
6893627 actually my classes start at 9 on mwf and 9 30 on tr it takes me about 15 minutes to get from the parking deck to my office and another fifteen to gather my materials and head down to the classroom so i leave the house at about 8 15
6893628 yeah eight fifteen and the last kid gets on the bus at 7 30 so theres 45 minutes for a nap right there
6893629 you could get dressed before we all get on the bus though
6893630 i imagine theres a lot of work involved in getting that many kids onto the bus in the morning
6893631 nah not really she just stands at the bottom of the stairs and shouts then goes back to bed except to drive the baby to the bus stop the rest of us have to walk its like a mile across a minor mountain range but oh well i guess we can handle it
6893632 ive offered to drive you but you always wave me off
6893633 yeah well i figure i can let you go get back in bed a little earlier im just being a nice kid
6893634 but i usually end up driving your sister down to catch the same bus in the same place driving right past you as a matter of fact
6893635 why dont you ask your mom what she does in the morning
6893636 why i know what she does she yells at us to get up and then she goes back to bed
6893637 let me just pretend you asked me i get up at 5 44 a m and wake up daddy then b twin then anime girl then g twin then cuteness i go upstairs and knock on beasties door because she needs a long time to straighten her hair then i go back downstairs to fold a load of laundry and start another then i work the wake up roll call backwards going up for beastie adding tomboy trooper racer and you since it is now 6 a m then applying second stage wake up force to cuteness g twin anime girl and b twin and sometimes daddy shall i go on
6893638 then i get dressed in running clothes make my bed wake up b twin cuteness and anime girl a third time and make breakfast at least two people will come asking me for socks at this point then i pull cuteness from her bed removing her nightgown and dressing her like a floppy life sized american girl doll i prop her up at the table in front of some breakfast food yell a reminder to b twin to put on clean clothes instead of the dirty ones from yesterday and start making lunches to order
6893639 so i always eat school lunch and you could make the lunches the night before
6893640 sure like i did last year so hungry little kids can open their lunchboxes in the cafeteria to discover that one of their piggish big siblings has eaten everything but the sandwich and left the empty wrappers in the lunchbox to rub their faces in it i think not
6893641 by this time its 6 30 so i yell one last wake up call to anime girl beastie tomboy you and trooper racer and help the twins find their backpacks which should always be in their cubbies but are probably instead hidden under heavy furniture or a pile of wet towels then i usher them and cuteness out to the car and we drive down the driveway
6893642 because their bus comes at 6 37 and if we miss it i cant take them to school until 7 15 which is when you high school and junior high school kids need to be at the bus which means yall will miss it and guess who gets to drive all the way out to the high school during which drive tomboy will fail to leave in time to catch her bus and ill have to drive her to school where i will have to get out of the car and check her in at the office because she will be tardy and ill still be in my pajamas because i dont get to shower until everyones gone
6893643 thats your mistake right there if you showered earlier you wouldnt have to drive any kids to school because youd be in the shower when they wanted you to do it so quit complaining
6893644 no id still have to drive them id just have to waste more time going into offices to sign the check in sheet because theyd all be late as was the case yesterday
6893645 but assuming they all make their buses then what do you go back to sleep
6893646 once cuteness is on her bus i run a mile around the block to jumpstart my metabolism then return to the house to get the older kids on their way this is the point at which someone else will ask me for socks and i will admonish him or her as charitably as possible to check the floor on the respective bathroom and bedroom and between the couch cushions and behind the computer desk yes i know all thirteen found pairs will be dirty i rest my case
6893647 nope youre right you leave yours in the yard instead where the cats pee on them
6893648 i dont want to spend my ref money on socks
6893649 okay then you can bring your socks in from the yard every night and put them in the laundry basket an ny wayy oh i usually have to break up a fight between beastie and trooper racer at this point as well then once the four oldest are finally gone i take tomboy down to her bus stop then i come back to the house for the third time put away the breakfast and lunch stuff move the laundry over again make my bed shower and get ready to teach if i have time which i usually dont i throw together a salad or grab a water bottle to take with me then i yell once at the engineer so he doesnt sleep through his 10 00 class which i think he might have done today in fact then i drive to campus and stand on my feet for either two or six solid hours lecturing and writing on the chalkboard when im done i wash the chalk off my hands and clothes and race home to meet the kindergarten bus catching as many errands as i can along the way
6893650 right and what time does the kindergarten bus bring spoiled baby who cant walk to the house carrying a stupid high school musical backpack with nothing in it but a blanket for her nappy time
6893651 two thirty with the elementary bus right behind it and we all go up to the house maybe driving but maybe walking where i make snack and move over one more load of laundry while talking to the little kids and waiting for the bigger ones
6893652 yeah talking over snack im exhausted just thinking about all that hard work
6893653 so after ive at least attempted to spend some time looking at schoolwork and catching up with each of the kids i move yet another load of laundry maybe drive some kids somewhere or pick them up from somewhere check my email and grade some papers until its time to start dinner
6893654 so your mom makes dinner that sounds like something more strenuous than sleeping
6893655 well sometimes she makes dinner sometimes we just have to scrounge for sandwiches or ramen noodles so its not saying much
6893656 she finds one of us kids and makes us clean up the kitchen and then nags us to go to bed while she just goofs around until 2 or 3 in the morning

6893666 youre underperforming in an aggressive bull market but in the sideways down moving market you get better performance relative to the market
6893667 theres been a disappointment with traditional equity funds since last year
6893668 the option premium received acts as a partial cushion to downside movements in the market and helps provide more consistent returns to investors especially in these more volatile times
6893669 the greater the share market volatility the greater the option premium received and hence the greater the buffer to downside movements in the market

6893700 the barack obama of hope and change and new politics is now running his campaign based on who owns the most houses this is the venomous nasty barack obama the country is seeing
6893701 the tribune discourages the use of unnamed sources according to the newspapers stylebook with exceptions made to protect the safety of a source or other extenuating circumstances
6893702 there are plenty of good reasons of course that reporters are willing to trade the truth in exchange for not naming the source of the information some sources may fear criticism others face retaliation and even physical danger for speaking out anonymity is a shield to protect them
6893703 the tribune will not print anonymously sourced material that adds only supplemental or trivial material to stories such as a zippy but unattributed quote that might enliven a prosaic narrative but that also might lead the reader to wonder about the validity of the material
6893704 we will educate the american people about baracks judgment through his association with rev wright it wont be this week it wont be next week
6893705 the barack obama of hope and change and new politics is now running his campaign based on who owns the most houses
6893706 this is the venomous nasty barack obama the country is seeing theyre looking at the polls and theyre just panicking
6893707 i think i did it when i was trying to make a tackle and i landed on it pretty good
6893708 didnt know id hurt it until monday when i came in and i couldnt raise my arm and it was swelling that was a little concern to me
6893709 the big o is close to being back having a healthy orlando in the lineup helps all of us you want to play like he does
6893710 if i have ever been insensitive to you or your clients my door is open
6893711 i have gone out of my way to serve all families
6893712 let me make this clear im not running because i am hispanic i cant change my name it happens to be cuellar
6893713 sometimes judges forget how to treat people its just not how you treat attorneys its how you treat the litigants
6893714 in the past when ive raised my opponents bar poll ratings she has accused me of negative campaigning so i wont
6893715 there are a lot of interesting rumors going around right now all we can say right now is we think this is going to be one of the most exciting positive developments that have happened on the square in a long time
6893716 weve been looking at photographs and things of the building back when it was built in the 1800s by samuel pickler and were with a few modern touches were going to try our best to restore it back to its original historical character here on the outside so that when you drive around the square you get some of that look
6893717 the number one thing they need to do is have a working fire detector smoke detector most of the house fires residential fires we go to do not have a working smoke detector or they do not have a battery in it
6893718 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
6893719 determine your location using nearby cell phone towers or gps for your mobile device or your computers ip address for your laptop google provides this service for free to both developers and users
6893720 working hard to bring gears to more mobile platforms such as android and others
6893721 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6893722 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6893723 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6893724 first you are not to have any contact with the victim at all
6893725 second because you havent been in dickinson county for very long im going to have you sign this waiver of extradition
6893726 you should see the people writing these 33 1 3 books
6893727 we got about 17 million for coffer dams and now its going to the house floor
6893728 that number can move but the point is the first money to actually start the construction if you do the coffer dams the rest of the money will start flowing
6893729 she feels a great deal of remorse for what she did
6893730 she is willing to accept responsibility for what she has done
6893731 this course is designed to continue the rabbi of lubavitchs way to educate the next generation of chabad leadership and to instill the love of israel
6893732 the objective is to send emissaries all over the world so that every jew would have the option of receiving physical and spiritual aid
6893733 the commander who is in charge of a platoon of kids
6893734 to be an emissary for chabad requires some sacrifice and adjustment to a certain reality the fact that some of the children here arrive from emissary families gives them an edge of sorts while their parents need to adjust to the emissary life style for them this life is routine
6893735 hard in training easy in the battle for the soul
6893736 i have friends in the army and i have talked to many soldiers in my life
6893737 we divided the troops into three regiments comprised of nine companies each soldier received a folder with everything they need to know we give the children a sense that we are fighting an enemy the enemy being evil nature each soldier must follow our rules most of them are aimed at the childrens safety no hitting other children no leaving the camp grounds and attendance at camp functions are mandatory
6893738 summer camp is the best way to educate the children because the activities yield an experience
6893739 you have joined hashems army the jewish army is like any other army it is built on discipline and values and as the rabbi said you can rise through the ranks
6893740 my father is an emissary in moscow and so are a few of my relatives
6893741 i really hope that in the future i will be an emissary in israel
6893742 i get asked a lot on whether or not im lonely and i explain that i meet a lot of interesting people and i do a lot of good deeds with my father and i understand the importance of being a chabad emissary
6893743 all of the other children are basically soldiers in hashems army and every soldier after he gets married and approved for the job will go whereever he is told we keep getting told that we are the commandos before i didnt know what that meant but after i was told what it meant and understood its meaning i feel good about myself
6893744 when you bring a jew closer to judaism and he performs a mitzvah you are a part of it and its fun
6893745 sometimes you dont know if you are going to be an emissary so i came here and it renewed my interest in becoming an emissary to be a part of bringing people together
6893746 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6893747 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6893748 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6893749 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6893750 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6893751 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6893752 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6893753 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6893754 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6893755 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6893756 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6893757 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6893758 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6893759 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6893760 i brian cronin i saw nate today waiting for an elevator i would never have guessed it was him had it not been
6893761 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6893762 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6893763 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6893764 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6893765 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6893766 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6893767 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6893768 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6893769 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6893770 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6893771 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6893772 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6893773 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6893774 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6893775 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6893776 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6893777 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6893778 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6893779 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6893780 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6893781 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6893782 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6893783 after they tasered me i told them who i was
6893784 they tasered me again i had fell to the ground and they sustained the taser
6893785 this agreement further solidifies the great relationship we have with major league baseball and together with our television deal allows us to bring the game of baseball to more fans than ever before our goal is always to deliver sports to fans across any platform and this is yet another agreement that fulfills that strategy
6893786 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6893787 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
6893788 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
6893789 be in the vanguard of what the national democratic party is becoming both in its demographics and its policies
6893790 so individual candidates and personalities matter far more than party labels
6893791 simply need to give the electorate an honest signal that they take the concerns of moderate religious voters seriously
6893792 where the demographics are moving in a direction similar to colorados front range
6893793 people think that we overuse the concept of green and it could become trite in its expression
6893794 this idea about green in a lot of peoples minds still conjures up this notion of a fringe or something thats out there it doesnt inspire this notion of a new america it just seems more substantive than a color
6893795 in the republican party theres probably twenty five to thirty per cent of the people who hate my guts
6893796 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6893797 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
6893798 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6893799 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6893800 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6893801 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6893802 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6893803 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6893804 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6893805 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6893806 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6893807 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6893808 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6893809 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6893810 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6893811 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6893812 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6893813 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6893814 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6893815 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6893816 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6893817 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6893818 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6893819 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6893820 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6893821 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6893822 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6893823 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6893824 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6893825 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6893826 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6893827 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6893828 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6893829 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6893830 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6893831 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6893832 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6893833 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6893834 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6893835 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6893836 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6893837 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6893838 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6893839 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6893840 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6893841 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6893842 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6893843 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6893844 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6893845 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6893846 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6893847 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6893848 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6893849 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6893850 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6893851 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6893852 the 4 1 2 year military strategy failed because it was a poorly planned amp poorly executed
6893853 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6893854 the rnc can concoct all of the outlandish conspiracy theories they want but when we saw that our fec report didnt accurately reflect the field work csi was hired to perform we corrected it its pretty bold for the rnc to attack us for a clerical error after john mccains campaign was just forced to return 50 000 raised by a foreign national through a number of contributors who werent even supporting mccain
6893855 its rare that people dont file any amended reports if he has a pattern of lots and lots of amended reports that would be more noteworthy than an occasional one
6893856 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6893857 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6893858 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6893859 that was a very short term contract for one week of work in ohio they asked us to do canvasses in five cities statewide
6893860 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
6893861 i do not know the day to day work of what they do im on the board
6893862 not for profit political and campaign management firm much like any political consulting firm
6893863 we have a wide range of clients we provide political campaign management we provide field services
6893864 our clients are typically considered liberal our clients are labor unions liberal to progressive candidates nonprofit organizations on the liberal side of the political spectrum
6893865 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
6893866 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate

6893871 lots of agencies can help with word of mouth digital advertising or pr strategies
6893872 but when was the last time you actually felt good about a brand interaction people gravitate to experiences that are relevant to their lives and aspirations all terrain has grown because we know how to break through the clutter and speak to people authentically where they live breathe and buy
6893873 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
6893874 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
6893875 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6893876 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6893877 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6893878 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6893879 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6893880 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6893881 it aint just the speed its the heart you want something thats not afraid to compete half these horses are just show ponies you want something thats not gonna run from a fight
6893882 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6893883 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6893884 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6893885 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6893886 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6893887 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6893888 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6893889 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6893890 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for
6893891 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6893892 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6893893 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6893894 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6893895 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

6893908 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6893909 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6893910 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6893911 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6893912 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6893913 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6893914 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday

6893923 the insurgents orcs stole everything out of the pump house a couple of years ago
6893924 they stripped it of all its wires and working parts and used them to make improvised explosive devices to use against us once the areas security improved we requested through our higher headquarters approval to fix it for the local people
6893925 the main road was the last stand for the insurgency in the area
6893926 the local population and marines would bypass the road completely and drive through the fields but now the road is a safe place
6893927 we appreciate the efforts of the marines and the iraqi police
6893928 these farm areas no one could use them because there was no water and people would drive through the fields but the marines now gave life to these farms and this area
6893929 i hired only people from lahib and no workers from outside the area
6893930 i hired them and taught them how to work construction that way they have another job skill they worked really hard to get this project done
6893931 the irrigation system has been broken since the beginning of the war
6893932 now that it is getting safer and safer here we can start piecing back together the area
6893933 these projects are just a taste of what we are able to do to help the iraqi people
6893934 the partnership between the coalition forces and the iraqis is at a level that when we work together we can accomplish anything
6893935 vamos entusiasmar as pessoas a participar de uma cultura de paz
6893936 outras campanhas geraram redu o de homic dios e essa tamb m vai gerar seguramente
6893937 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6893938 they told me there are going to be resources here
6893939 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6893940 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6893941 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6893942 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6893943 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6893944 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6893945 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6893946 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6893947 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6893948 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6893949 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6893950 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6893951 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6893952 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6893953 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6893954 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6893955 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6893956 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6893957 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6893958 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6893959 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6893960 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6893961 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6893962 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6893963 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6893964 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6893965 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6893966 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6893967 my point of view is that we need to be surgical in our approach
6893968 we have to use a scalpel in weighing budget cuts not a machete
6893969 theres going to be a little bit of pain but its been spread real thin across the board
6893970 the one place i am concerned with a little bit is van duyn and whats going to actually happen there that probably took the biggest of the hits but on a whole i think we will get through this
6893971 my god every household is feeling pain because of the high cost of everything and if we cant do the same with government and live with some cuts id be surprised
6893972 i dont think this is a big problem the real issue what will happen in january if revenues dont come in
6893973 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6893974 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6893975 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6893976 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6893977 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6893978 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6893979 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6893980 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6893981 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6893982 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6893983 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6893984 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6893985 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6893986 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6893987 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6893988 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6893989 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6893990 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6893991 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6893992 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6893993 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6893994 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6893995 no est relacionada con el gobierno de venezuela ni el gobierno de uruguay

6894004 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6894005 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6894006 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6894007 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6894008 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

6894014 how many negative listings would you have to see deleted from consumer credit reports before you would believe that bad credit can be deleted ten fifty a hundred one thousand
6894015 how about 50 000 deleted listings would that convince you
6894016 in these pages we have listed the permanent deletion of over 50 000 listings from our clients files in the last two years alone
6894017 theres one deleted bankruptcy and theres another and another and another should i go on
6894018 i have this one listing on my credit report that simply must belong to somebody else
6894019 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6894020 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6894021 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6894022 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6894023 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6894024 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6894025 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6894026 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6894027 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6894028 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6894029 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6894030 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6894031 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
6894032 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
6894033 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6894034 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6894035 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6894036 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6894037 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6894038 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6894039 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6894040 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6894041 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6894042 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6894043 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6894044 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6894045 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6894046 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6894047 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6894048 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6894049 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6894050 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6894051 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6894052 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6894053 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6894054 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6894055 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6894056 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6894057 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6894058 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6894059 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6894060 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6894061 la prima conseguenza che prevediamo una forte riduzione delle programmazioni a partire dagli spettacoli pomeridiani una parte importante della popolazione rester senza cinema infatti 180 000 biglietti staccati nelle sale fiorentine sono quelli degli anziani ultrasessantenni che frequentano il cinema del pomeriggio e non si tratta di spettatori occasionali ma di clienti forti che frequentano assiduamente le sale continua stefani questo costituisce un grave danno non solo per la vita culturale di queste persone ma per lintera citt anche perch gli anziani rappresentano la parte pi consistente della popolazione con un rapporto di 250 ultrasessantacinquenni ogni 100 adolescenti eppure lamministrazione comunale e regionale non sembrano interessate a questi dati
6894062 chiunque pu constatare che le multisale non creano nuovi spettatori ma li spostano e li rubano alle realt pi piccole a firenze il numero di quelli che vanno al cinema fermo dal 1993 anzi leggermente diminuito in secondo luogo continua stefani non ci sar rivitalizzazione ma il contrario interi quartieri come novoli careggi e rifredi rischiano la desolazione con la chiusura non solo dei cinema ma anche dei negozi che non reggeranno la concorrenza con il grande centro commerciale quando il flora chiuder ad esempio che ne sar di piazza dalmazia diventer un deserto lasciato al degrado e alla delinquenza

6894068 it may well be that the parade is tasteless but equally it may be that in a more mature society the vast majority might consider it harmless

6894071 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6894072 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6894073 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6894074 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6894075 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6894076 some thought the presumptive republican nominee didnt do a good enough job making his case to the general electorate after having sown up the republican nomination while his rivals in the opposition party were still slugging it out for the democratic nod
6894077 as people slow start focusing on the presumptive democratic nominee they realize that theres not much substance to his eloquent speeches

6894153 its wonderful if the world would catch up to speed
6894154 while the actual number of transgender representations on tv remains relatively small what were seeing on tv is a move away from the stereotypical marginalized roles weve seen in the past sex workers behind bars being murdered
6894155 these more diverse and accurate representations play a vital role in helping audiences understand transgender lives

6894161 hey lets nail an absorbent hard to clean fabric based material down there
6894162 for a 350 mile web of bike lanes and trails by the year 2030
6894163 the plan says crews dont have to go around town redoing every street it says crews should draw in bike lanes when they repave roads or widen them the cost would be about 2 million per year
6894164 it looks like its out of the 60s like an airport out of the 60s looks like lincoln center i dont like that flat roof especially in orlando where it rains a lot this thing isnt going to look good from the air is that magnolia running through the center of the site thats not very attractive this isnt going to be good enough
6894165 people need to be responsible for themselves and their children
6894166 students trusting their guts reaching out when even they have just a funny feeling and watching out for other students are all part of how we are going to help keep each other safe during these times whether there is a large community concern like there is right now because we are very concerned about that as well
6894167 merrill lynchs conduct harmed tens of thousands of investors who will have the opportunity to get their money back through this agreement
6894168 we will continue to aggressively investigate wrongdoing in the marketing and sale of auction rate securities
6894169 the group of militants opened fire at the surrounding troops resulting in an on the spot death of an army colonel and two soldiers
6894170 did they know that the congress was defeated in some of the state assembly elections only now if congress party is a sinking ship why did the marxists continue on it till the indo us nuclear deal was signed
6894171 is it a possible electoral defeat that is making the left break ties now so is the opposition to the nuclear deal just a reason for this end
6894172 the intention of a pre poll alliance for a broader secular force in uttar pradesh is final it depends on the attitude of the congress hopefully both parties will be realistic in their approach
6894173 in our relationship with the congress it is still not clear where we stand politically there has not been a formal talk on an alliance all discussions have been preliminary in nature
6894174 lakhs of poor patients who sometimes commit suicide as they cannot afford expensive treatment are availing the benefit of this scheme we have identified only those hospitals which are capable of providing treatment for diseases and ailments covered under the scheme
6894175 the corporate hospitals are charging hefty fees from patients for even simple ailments or surgeries as the government is paying on their behalf
6894176 a major portion of the funds are now going to corporate hospitals who are charging hefty fees for even small surgeries
6894177 all you need to do is spend the money of this scheme to supplement facilities or add modern life saving equipment and they can provide treatment as good as any corporate hospital the government hospitals are also more accessible for the poor
6894178 the scheme ignores the immediate health needs of the poor while diseases like cancer and heart ailments can only be treated at hospitals having hi tech facilities which means corporate hospitals patients wanting even appendicitis operations need to go to such hospitals because the scheme provides only for laproscopic surgery which is available in private or corporate hospitals
6894179 i am only waiting for the report of an eight member committee headed by haryana agriculture minister harmohinder singh chatha which has been asked to look into the issue
6894180 since they are coming to our state to demonstrate their hegemony over us we have to show that we are determined to break free of their stranglehold
6894181 yes of course an explosion of extreme feelings is inevitable anything can happen when the atmosphere is charged
6894182 we have received applications from a number of foreign institutions like harvard university cambridge university and others their interest in indian sites is positive for us as this provides us with updated modern technological know how and adequate funds the need for modern technology and digitisation of old records are required for a country like ours which is so hugely endowed with ancient sites for such large scale projects huge amount of funds are also required these foreign universities on the other hand face shortage of such sites and look towards indian heritage sites for an opportunity to conduct excavation processes
6894183 we encourage foreign institutes to take active part in the excavations through tie ups with indian universities certainly these foreign universities have advanced technology and we are always short of adequate infrastructure the tie ups are mutually beneficial
6894184 we have received a sanction of rs 18 lakh this year from cambridge university for funding excavation projects and students and faculty who would go out on the exchange programme
6894185 thanks to the tie up we can now conduct tests like radio carbon dating c 14 more accurately and make useful comparisons of our results with their reports
6894186 everyone who has opposed the nuclear deal will have a space in this national alliance
6894187 it is the relevance of the issue that has brought us together we are against all brands of imperialist forces the indo us nuclear deal is the worst manifestation of american imperialism
6894188 we do have serious differences with the left on several issues but when it comes to opposing imperialism the left has always been in the forefront and we appreciate that
6894189 this is carbon free free energy from the sun and that would be a great thing for our environment so this is really a step in producing energy with the least environmental impact
6894190 you people are from the national media why dont you write about it so that the concerned authorities repair and protect these bunkers
6894191 one bunker is already crumbling and if landslides take away all the remaining ones then nothing would be left of the lone historic battle that baba jaswant fought
6894192 these bunkers do have a lot of sentimental significance for the army while the army has been maintaining them especially at jaswantgarh rains and snow play havoc all over the eastern himalayas
6894193 so far five militants have been killed in the operation
6894194 we also lost three soldiers including commanding officer of 45 rr
6894195 there is every possibility of more militants hiding in the dense forests and the operation is going on to flush them out
6894196 we have to build on this momentum and take the struggle forward
6894197 it is always difficult to manage the crowds of this scale things get out of hand sometimes
6894198 but then you cant ignore the fact that people dutifully follow our programme
6894199 dont you think the message today was unmistakable what we are witnessing is the largest ever gathering of people and with just one chant on their lips azaadi
6894200 we have 11 days left before the transfer deadline and we are working at something but you never know in football
6894201 it may happen it may not if it doesnt we will carry on with what we have got
6894202 wayne does too much around the pitch at the expense of what he does up front
6894203 it is a waste of his energy to chase back to our own penalty area for instance
6894204 but it is not something to worry about too much it is purely down to enthusiasm and natural energy he just loves playing football
6894205 with keane where the ball was he wanted to be there
6894206 dont forget wayne is only 22 we hope to channel what he does
6894207 his natural affection for the game will help him too he has started to identify the fact it is a weakness
6894208 he needs to be more involved around the edge of the box but it is only a small correction
6894209 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6894210 i dont just judge my performance on goals i look at assists and how i have helped the team play that is the way my game is
6894211 there is no doubt chelsea gained a convincing result last weekend
6894212 but it is very difficult to assess the league in early season you have to be patient and wait to see how it is going to shape up
6894213 one thing is for sure they will not give medals out in august and september
6894214 everyones wish is not to get injuries but they happen
6894215 to the person that smashed my car window i feel bad that you only got a 20 adapter after doing 395 of damage to my car if you want the iphone that goes with the charger write your name phone number and address here
6894216 but the question now is was 2007 when he carved up minor league hitters and went 1 0 1 89 in three september starts
6894217 for the future well being of the yankees it is more important for phil hughes to pitch in the majors during september than for pavano to make his starts hughes will be with the team for the next several years and needs the experience pavano will probably be in st louis or on the west coast the fact that brian cashman informed pavano of saturdays start shows that joe girardi has no control whatsoever in regards to who he has on the team and who should play those days of managers dictating what type of team they want are long gone its not out of the question that cashman tells girardi when to take out pitchers and when to put aging players in center field
6894218 it seems the tendonitis resulted from overuse likely from the transition of relieving to starting
6894219 what the proposed rules do is to provide directions towards federal agencies as to which way to make the calls on those very marginal areas youre not sure as to whether its going to have an effect may effect or no effect thats always sort of a gray area
6894220 it would be irresponsible and improper to use an endangered species act as a backdoor way to regulate or address global warming
6894221 yeah thats wrong the changes allow an agency lets say the department of transportation which is proposing an action that may effect an endangered species to make the call about whether that effect will occur without consulting with the wildlife agencies and so the agencies such as the department of transportation have first of all no substantial expertise in deciding whether these effects will occur with respect to endangered species and second of all they like building highways building dams and so forth they are not primarily interested in protecting species and for that reason the statute requires cooperation between the agencies interested in doing things like building highways and the wildlife agencies that are interested in protecting species
6894222 mi informaci n es que no se han retirado completamente de reas consideradas no disputadas y tienen que hacerlo
6894223 rusia no ha cumplido con el acuerdo de paz y que rusia tiene que cumplirlo ahora
6894224 cumplir significa cumplir con el plan de arreglo y todav a no hemos visto eso
6894225 ha habido algunos movimientos de tropas pero si eso es o no una indicaci n de una retirada o simplemente un recolocaci n de las tropas es un poco dif cil de determinar en este momento pero estos movimientos siguen siendo reducidos
6894226 rusia finalmente ha comenzado a sacar a sus fuerzas de georgia pero han fracasado sin duda alguna a la hora de cumplir sus obligaciones bajo el acuerdo de alto el fuego

6894230 me voy del cargo por respeto a las mujeres y mi compromiso al pa s y porque considero el abuso sexual como un delito grave
6894231 el asunto en el que se le involucra al parecer surgi antes que ortega fuese presidente del vecino pa s es posible que eso sea una presunci n
6894232 mientras un tribunal no lo condene l es inocente aunque ese asunto es importante no es posible que el gobierno hondure o rechace su presencia aqu porque no nos toca juzgarlo y hay que recibirlo con todos los honores de un mandatario
6894233 si ortega tiene un poco de vergenza no debe venir porque l ha sido denunciado como un abusador de la hija de su esposa rosario murillo

6894256 he was different i really thought that tebow was going to win it sometime in his career because that guy was productive but was different something the fans would really be lit up by a guy like weinke is sheer numbers and winning he was a little different too because he was an older man he was different too because there was a story to go along with it

6894261 today if youre a ship coming into the arctic for the first time you wont see any difference because during the early season its all covered in ice but it seems like the breakup is coming faster and as we know the freeze up is later
6894262 its a huge job to track all the ships up here
6894263 ninety five per cent of the traffic up here is legitimate commerce the good guys who keep the global economy going its the other five per cent we worry about the drug smugglers and the terrorists and the other bad guys

6894269 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
6894270 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
6894271 moms are more frugal about what they spend and how much they drive
6894272 and thats a treat you get to the point that you get excited about going out even if its to the grocery store
6894273 its amazing what you can learn to do without if you watch your spending and budget
6894274 i want to be there for my children and my family
6894275 i think ok what all do i have to do while im out
6894276 its hard on them if they dont get out much
6894277 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
6894278 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
6894279 we are not staying home with our children by default
6894280 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
6894281 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
6894282 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that

6894301 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted delivery schedules have slipped contractor employees have been laid off
6894302 the end result is a current it system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
6894303 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6894304 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6894305 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science

6894310 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6894311 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6894314 the risks imposed on the system as a whole if common exposures significantly increased the correlation of returns across institutions
6894315 note that in warning against excessive concentrations or common exposures across the banking system regulators need not make a judgment about whether a particular asset class is mispriced although rapid changes in asset prices or risk premiums may increase the level of concern
6894316 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6894317 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6894318 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6894319 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6894320 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6894321 he is going to say finally we are to the place where we are going to do what i have been calling for ever since we got in and that is to get out
6894322 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
6894323 in american movies growing up tends to be a job for either aryan youth types or the oddballs and outsiders who long a staple of both sitcoms and the sundance film festival have migrated to big hollywood in droves but growing up apatow style just means learning to divide your attention between your joystick and the little lady who loves you just the way you are flab and all real life is harder as is real art
6894324 part of the secret sauce that enabled apple to build the system is the small footprint merom processor that intel accelerated into production for the company as shown below the packaging for the merom processor at the heart of the mba is significantly smaller than a standard mobile processor intel also compressed the 965 chipset and in doing so reduced the total cpu chipset footprint by about 60 percent
6894325 i was waiting for the taste you said youd bring to me
6894326 it really matters in the sense that there is much more drama in the 2008 democratic national convention than there has been in a convention for a long time that drama is watching the first three days and wondering what the last night will look like
6894327 i think the great danger is that turning the clintonistas loose for the first three days and then expecting them to come home on the final day in visible support of obama is risky
6894328 there is a chance for things to go wrong and they do involve the clintons
6894329 this roll call vote is a little dicey this business of giving the two lead clintons air time odds are neither of them will be a problem but that roll call vote could be a problem
6894330 there is more to be lost than to be gained from the convention its important enough to avoid the loss that they do what theyre doing in order to avoid defections after the convention
6894331 to look for a camera and they will tell you nasty things about obama and say they will never support him
6894332 you watch the fourth night of the convention and you watch the end of obamas acceptance speech when presumably hillary comes on the stage
6894333 is hillary lifting obamas arm over his head saying we are in this together and he is our champion
6894334 she has to demonstrate real enthusiasm for obama and she has to shake a finger at her supporters who are not yet willing to join him
6894335 its going to go into the last night before we know whether theyve had a successful convention
6894336 truman would not backtrack on his commitment to civil rights but neither would congress give him the civil rights legislation he requested
6894337 his successors as party leaders would show little disposition to push civil rights until the mass protests led by martin luther king jr forced the hands of john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson only then would the ultimate threat of the dixiecrats be realized the movement of the white south into the republican party
6894338 it left the party with scars that last to this day when they meet in a national convention amid evidence of internal divisions unmatched since 1968

6894481 most certainly not god intended it to be man and woman only
6894482 yes its the next civil rights movement the limitation of specific americans rights is unconstitutional and extremely ignorant
6894483 thats gross its wrong god designed marriage 4 man and woman nt man and man or woman and woman
6894484 no immorality should nt be sanctioned just bcause its trendy
6894485 it was adam and eve not adam and steve absolutely no to gay marriage in mo
6894486 i oppose same sex marriage because the bible speaks against it
6894487 no it is not biblical and our country is waning away from god too much
6894488 of course they should its not a matter of morality its a matter of everyone deserving to be happy
6894489 yes it should they should be allowed the same right to marry as we do
6894490 no no and i repeat no one man for one woman is the only marriage that is right
6894491 marriage is between man and woman as god intended from the beginning of time california should gives its citizens a chance to decide in november whats the point of the people deciding if its giong to be overridden by the court anyway same sex marriage is against god and what this country was built on
6894492 unfortunately this is an issue in which people of faith speak out of both sides of their mouths on the one hand they decry the high divorce rate and the crumbling family at the same time that they would deny loving and committed couples to strengthen those very numbers objection on moral grounds is irrelevant as no one is asking that people who believe it to be wrong enter into such arrangements the issue is about the civil rights of all gay and lesbian americans as such the church should have no say in this debate about the legality of the issue
6894493 i feel that we should because they are going to be together anyways amp this could lessen them from person to person

6894497 gay marriages should not be encouraged acknowledged or recognized in missouri just because another state wants to accept deviant behavior doesnt mean it should be honored elsewhere marriage is meant for procreation unity of family and teaching of our young it is not meant to fulfill sexual preference or obtain legal benefits such as insurance or social security benefits
6894498 absoulutely not the word gay and marriage should not be said in the same sentence its morally wrong so why should the states condone it and legalize it it just maims the word marriage in my opinion
6894499 absolutely not the sanctity of marriage should be kept sacred in the eyes of god i dont believe he meant same sex

6894554 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6894555 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6894556 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
6894557 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
6894558 the government needs to do something it doesnt have to have a meeting with me
6894559 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6894560 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6894561 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6894562 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6894563 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6894564 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6894565 the sad thing is we have plenty of other mechanisms for people to use
6894566 im not sure the safe haven law is really going to help in a majority of cases
6894567 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6894568 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6894569 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6894570 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6894571 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6894572 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6894573 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6894574 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6894575 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6894576 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6894577 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6894578 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently

6894599 they would be better served if they were candid and admitted it was a choice they made i think everyone has experienced a moment of extreme excitement like when they watched their child score a goal catch a fish or they won a jackpot but i dont see any soccer moms out there committing crimes saying their rise in endorphins made them do it
6894600 why would a 54 year old married woman with a family and good employees all of a sudden revert to what she did it was a behavior prompted by something until she was caught and it came to light she didnt realize the extent of what she was doing she never consciously knew how long it had gone on and how much money she took

6894611 as some of you might know john mccain is a long time acquaintance of mine that goes way back to our time together at the u s naval academy and as prisoners of war in vietnam he is a man i respect and admire in some ways but there are a number of reasons why i will not vote for him for president of the united states
6894612 im not necessarily religious but i am spiritual and i believe in god
6894613 and what this characters trying to figure out is how do i balance what my duty is to my country versus what my duty is to god versus what my duty is to this woman who i love is in my life and him having to deal with all of that stuff is a very human sort of question

6894621 as soon as the ships obtain the power they need via our shore side power supply system they can switch off their diesel generators while theyre berthed in port these diesel generators not only produce electrical power but also exhaust emissions soot particulate matters and noise so in this way these ships will help to reduce harbor smog which is becoming an increasingly serious environmental problem in many port cities
6894622 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6894623 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6894624 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6894625 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6894626 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal

6894633 you wouldnt think you were going to get hurt but he would hurt you
6894634 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
6894635 he was the kind of guy that i could look to for reassurance or confirmation he was proud to go and he knew what he was doing
6894636 like a child awaiting christmas he even initiated a countdown as he got closer to going overseas
6894637 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
6894638 its tough you talk to everybody talk to the family just make sure that everybody that needs to talk to somebody can talk to somebody
6894639 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan

6894749 on the consoles they want us to charge money for them because thats in their model and our model is very much more to grow the community by giving out free updates
6894750 the largest update to team fortress 2 since it was first released
6894751 we urge you to instruct the canadian embassy in bogota to investigate these threats against the nasa leaders in northern cauca and to offer any assistance and protection required
6894752 once again this latest threat draws attention to the rampant human rights violations in colombia and offers a warning of what could come with a free trade deal if colombia does not stop the systematic terror campaigns and crimes against trade unionists indigenous and afro colombian communities and the victims of displacement
6894753 we believe they are being threatened and repressed because they defend their right to live free of persecution on their ancestral territory
6894754 what if what if someway we were sitting there knocking on the door of that big game and playing it together out here at this that new stadium sitting there with arlington mayor bob cluck tarrant county and really having a big time
6894755 i dont mind telling you ken hamlin you would have come up with a few dollars less if i didnt think we had a shot at doing
6894756 but this is a team youre going to be proud of
6894757 and im already proud of these guys fourteen weeks in the offeseason what theyve done so far to work and be the best they can be weve got a ways to go weve got more preseason games to go to get this season started but im proud of what theyve done were going to do good things were going to do real good things
6894758 i hadnt listened to much jazz but then i heard julius hemphills album dogon a d and that completely turned me around it captured everything i liked in music it had this stax r amp b sensibility and it had this other wildness it was incredible thats when i started playing
6894759 the choice of reagan is also a positive for mccain because he will look young and vigorous compared to reagan and he will look more
6894760 she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
6894761 referred to me as having been descended from john d rockefeller and such whenever it was to her advantage
6894762 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6894763 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
6894764 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
6894765 many of her colleagues believed that it had a lot to do with me and my name
6894766 between the two of us i dont think it ever came up specifically as to like you know lets look up in the family tree but she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
6894767 from what ive heard lately it might not be but as far as i know its my name
6894768 perhaps at some point we can do a dna test to really find out
6894769 im quite sure i grew up in new york city
6894770 i cant predict the future but i do think about my little girl every day every moment im awake the moment i go to sleep i think of her the moment i wake up i think of her
6894771 i miss her unbelievably much i cannot begin to tell you how much i miss her she is the love of my life
6894772 sir we are very happy to have had your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely but we are a little puzzled while you were away we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire what puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow 5 000
6894773 where else in new york city can i park my car for two weeks for only 15 41 and expect it to be there when i return
6894774 after an all night stay i was watching people hang around the lobby sleeping on the chairs and on the floor and i said you know theres got to be something better than this
6894775 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces
6894776 wednesday should not be considered the final word there could be a delay of a day or two but you will see results in a week or so
6894777 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like stricker said
6894778 that ryder cup is there a couple of weeks away when he makes that decision and im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6894779 i feel a little more pressure to tell you the truth coming into this week just because of that reason trying to make the team like i say ive got two things going on at one time and im trying my best to separate them out
6894780 i take nothing but positives from winning that award even though it was two years in a row said stricker who is sitting at 132 after rounds of 68 64
6894781 and tiger said something to me after i won it the second time and he was dead serious and i dont know if ive said this before but he looked at me in the eyes and hes like you know no one ever will do that again and thats the way that guy thinks
6894782 im just thinking great i won it again and hes like no ones ever going to do that again which is pretty cool
6894783 ive been on the bubble like you say throughout he said
6894784 i felt like it puts extra pressure on you each week you have this extra goal out there that you are trying to make and its hard to focus on both things
6894785 so its been difficult to try to shove that in the back of my mind because it keeps coming up
6894786 i talked to ben and he thought i would be mad at him and all that kind of stuff stricker said laughing
6894787 i was rooting for the guy you cant root against him hes a great guy and its not over yet
6894788 thats what i keep telling myself i have got three more weeks to try to play well and show zinger that i deserve to be on that team
6894789 i havent played a round that well in a long time
6894790 my scores have been okay but i really felt like i played some good golf so im very excited
6894791 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6894792 i definitely had a good time out there and definitely my game is improving
6894793 i was in the trees all day yesterday so there wasnt too much aggression i could have in the middle of the trees
6894794 but it was a good day today i hit the ball well and had some chances
6894795 after the british my swing got all screwed up and i was trying to work the ball too much instead of just hitting my normal shot which is a power fade off the tee and a slight cut on my irons
6894796 i was hitting draws and then what happened was i was starting to hit pull hooks and hooks and bring the whole course into play and all the trouble into play
6894797 so now im getting back to playing my normal shot
6894798 when youre in a golf tournament you really dont care because theres 10 million waiting for you at the end of this tunnel
6894799 youre just trying to jockey into position right now to have a shot with nine holes to go on sunday
6894800 so im just trying to focus on my game and hopefully i can do the job
6894801 hello my name is craig and im a air tist
6894802 mi informaci n es que no se han retirado completamente de reas consideradas no disputadas y tienen que hacerlo
6894803 rusia no ha cumplido con el acuerdo de paz y que rusia tiene que cumplirlo ahora
6894804 cumplir significa cumplir con el plan de arreglo y todav a no hemos visto eso
6894805 ha habido algunos movimientos de tropas pero si eso es o no una indicaci n de una retirada o simplemente un recolocaci n de las tropas es un poco dif cil de determinar en este momento pero estos movimientos siguen siendo reducidos
6894806 rusia finalmente ha comenzado a sacar a sus fuerzas de georgia pero han fracasado sin duda alguna a la hora de cumplir sus obligaciones bajo el acuerdo de alto el fuego
6894807 instamos a rusia a que se adhiera por completo al acuerdo
6894808 oh im not used to people keeping up with me like that
6894809 i do not like the tone of voice your pastry chef uses when she tells me to have a nice day
6894810 ill ignore her attitude and try not to quake in my shoes comments rss
6894811 russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6894812 imperial capabilities so much that america will go down the same path as persia rome and the soviet union one of the newer refutations of this comes to us from robert lieber at
6894813 just as the rest of the world is opening up america is closing down
6894814 the magic is over it will never be as it was before
6894815 over the years americas staying power has been regularly and chronically underestimated by condescending french and british statesmen in the nineteenth century by german japanese and soviet militarists in the twentieth and by homegrown prophets of doom today the critiques come and go the object of their contempt never does
6894816 economy would fall off a cliff if energy prices slumped and its population racked by ill health and inequality is shrinking by up to 800 000 a year russia can make mischief but it cannot project military and ideological power all around the world as the soviet union did during the cold war
6894817 no poseo doble moral y asumo posiciones claras y determinantes en mi vida por eso renunci de manera irrevocable a partir de hoy ante el presidente manuel zelaya
6894818 consult con el presidente y sus colaboradores sobre el problema la llegada de ortega y evadieron el tema ante esa situaci n me debo a las mujeres y mi nico anhelo es servirlas
6894819 me voy del cargo por respeto a las mujeres y mi compromiso al pa s y porque considero el abuso sexual como un delito grave
6894820 el asunto en el que se le involucra al parecer surgi antes que ortega fuese presidente del vecino pa s es posible que eso sea una presunci n
6894821 mientras un tribunal no lo condene l es inocente aunque ese asunto es importante no es posible que el gobierno hondure o rechace su presencia aqu porque no nos toca juzgarlo y hay que recibirlo con todos los honores de un mandatario
6894822 si ortega tiene un poco de vergenza no debe venir porque l ha sido denunciado como un abusador de la hija de su esposa rosario murillo

6894863 you have a great idea but we cannot grant funds to a for profit enterprise
6894864 we are trying to avoid working with government they will just politicize the project and screw it up

6894880 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6894881 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6894882 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6894883 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition

6894893 according to crist the key to getting the deal started was a federal lawsuit filed by earthjustice and the florida wildlife federation challenging the practice of backpumping farm runoff containing phosphorous pesticides and other chemicals into the lake
6894894 the suit contended that backpumping triggered massive algae blooms and compromised drinking water quality for small towns such as pahokee and south bay that draw their supply from the lake
6894895 in december 2006 u s district judge cecilia altonaga ruled that backpumping violates the clean water act then in august 2007 the south florida water management district the defendant in the case voted 4 3 to end the practice the four votes came from crist appointees
6894896 sugar executives viewed the decision as devastating so they assigned the lobbyists to ask crist where the industry stood

6894901 we must reject the idea well intentioned but dead wrong that the primary path to greatness in the social sectors is to become more like a business

6894923 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6894924 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6894925 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6894926 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6894927 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6894928 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6894929 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6894930 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6894931 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6894932 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site

6894939 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6894940 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous

6894946 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6894947 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

6894951 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6894952 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed

6894954 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6894955 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6894956 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6894957 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6894958 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6894959 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6894960 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6894961 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6894962 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6894963 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6895068 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations
6895069 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6895070 i think the word renegotiate does not have double meaning
6895071 it is about opening it up and negotiating it again and the fact that hes willing to do that again has to demonstrate in my mind given the context of it a bias for the lower basin states his desire still to renegotiate it was really pretty direct
6895072 this is a reversal of direction but its a reversal that i think colorado voters have to pay clear attention to because on the west slope im not sure there are more important issues than the issue of the scarcity of water
6895073 id like that to be one of those thoughts you leave unexpressed

6895169 check yes juliet are you with me rain is falling down on the sidewalk i wont go until you come outside check yes juliet kill the limbo ill keep tossing rocks at your window theres no turning back for us tonight lace up your shoes a oh a oh oh heres how we do run baby run dont ever look back theyll tear us apart if you give them the chance give them the chance dont sell your heart dont say were not meant to be run baby run forever well be you and me
6895170 i respect the originality of an artist like dr john
6895171 he created a persona to use as an agent of fearlessness
6895172 high tides become an issue if they wash over a nest thats already hatched and are waiting to emerge we had a nest further up the beach and thats exactly what happened
6895173 you start to feel like theyre your babies and you want to make sure they make it to the ocean ok because their probability of survival is so low
6895174 its tough enough for them to swim for two days straight so any other disaster is hard on the population
6895175 we had trouble with charlie and with other storms keep your fingers crossed that weve seen the worst of it
6895176 i think the vietnamese are interested in working with us because we are the oldest polytechnic in singapore
6895177 the fact that our engineering schools make up 40 per cent of our student population its a big part of our entire set up and strength
6895178 we chose vietnam again because sp told us the country is hungry for development it expresses ownership and leadership thats an important component to help us decide
6895179 if we can achieve some level of systems change upgrade the curriculum as well as the technical and vocational education to become of a certain standard thats recognised regionally in the long term thats good
6895180 with this experience iftemasek foundation has other opportunities wed be keen to
6895181 but its not easy for us to go to a government and present these ideas
6895182 people close to a mccain campaign also floated a wild card choice gen david h petraeus a top american comm amp er in iraq
6895183 it looks great neither too feminine nor flashy but classy and well styled the soft top roof leaves more boot space than a folding hard top
6895184 breast pain can be cyclic coming with menstrual periods or it can be more persistent
6895185 one of the best gifts they can give themselves and their babies is to breastfeed for as long as possible
6895186 then when your breasts shrink again you have this loose skin that makes it look saggier than it did before
6895187 theyre fibrous tissue that holds the breast up a bit and those can stretch over time and that leads to some of the sagging too
6895188 wearing a tight fitting bra on a regular basis probably doesnt make a big difference
6895189 but wearing a bra that prevents a lot of bouncing like with jogging probably does minimize stretching of those fibrous bands
6895190 many of these things that cause breast pain in young women are going to turn out to be benign but there are breast cancers that happen in young women
6895191 my advice is just because youre young and youre less likely to have a cancer doesnt mean that you shouldnt get it looked at
6895192 its easy enough and there are certainly women out there who find their breast cancers that way
6895193 i encourage all women to do a breast self exam and get comfortable with what their breasts feel like
6895194 thats when you have the least hormonal effect and youre going to have the most accurate exam
6895195 as we get older sort of in a progressive way but certainly after menopause the breast becomes more fat and has less glandular tissue
6895196 we lose the hormonal effect on our glandular tissue in our breasts and over time that tissue atrophies
6895197 thats a time when women notice their breasts are less firm certainly less tender if theyve had problems with tenderness and theyre less lumpy
6895198 as the fat content increases the sensitivity of the mammogram often increases
6895199 i think the model is broken the line between what is specialty and what is studio blurred
6895200 companies are going under because of hair and makeup they dont do anything within a logical budget for this business
6895201 the marketplace simply could not withstand that overcrowding and many strong films suffered as a result this year i think things have contracted a bit and there are less of these films and theyre being positioned differently
6895202 there used to be two approaches releasing something limited and adding markets or releasing it wide
6895203 today there are scores of different models in which to distribute films the theatrical model still works on some pictures but it works less and you have to be more selective
6895204 just tell me who you are and where i am
6895205 tell you where you are cap youre home this is the cleveland pyramid im sarah shadow you dont recognize me
6895206 i woke up today the first person i saw was you but ive never seen you before in my life i figured as long as i was in the hospital or wherever id start to remember but its a blank where am i what is this place what are you people
6895207 and that whats that are you part of a circus act or something
6895208 sugarstats makes it simple to track monitor and share your blood sugar levels and other key statistics to help you manage your diabetes online
6895209 there has never been an irish band that has done anything like what theyve done i dont even know of a single band in the world that sounds anything like them let alone in ireland
6895210 the strike announced loud and clear that my business model was out of date and that i had to take serious and immediate action
6895211 we cannot go on doing the things we are doing unless not only you but a lot of other people outside know the raison detre the background the reasons the problems
6895212 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
6895213 we havent put ourselves in position to win more thats just the gist of it
6895214 we havent led enough laps we havent knocked off as many top fives we havent done those things as well as we need to do to win more races when you dont do those things youre not going to win a lot of races
6895215 men in singapore still dont know how to use styling products so they prefer to keep their hair short and neat
6895216 asian hair also has a thicker and heavier texture but at the same time mens hair tends to thin easily a good haircut has to take these factors into consideration
6895217 capello loft for men marks the first step of our plans to help set up men only salons hopefully in the future we will have more of such salons all over singapore where hairstylists are trained in cutting mens hair and where men go to get their haircuts in a chic environment
6895218 for the longest time there hasnt been such a salon for men why should we be treated as second grade
6895219 a man whos excessively concerned about his clothes and appearance
6895220 if another violent crackdown happens in myanmar ill channel my emotions through meditation or through online petitions
6895221 we will still continue with our social and political activities
6895222 no objection to members of the myanmarese community in singapore pursuing their political activities so long as they abide by our laws indeed the police has approved and facilitated many such activities conducted through lawful means
6895223 obp has chosen to do so in open and persistent defiance of our laws obp members were investigated by the police for staging a number of illegal protests the authorities have chosen to issue several of them with a warning for their offences instead of prosecution so as to give them a second chance
6895224 regrettably this leniency is not appreciated some of the individuals concerned in the obp continue to maintain a position that suggests they see themselves being above the law which singaporeans observe
6895225 the obp members have ignored repeated advice from the police to act within our laws and also ignored requests by government officials to meet to discuss the groups conduct
6895226 the right of a foreign national to work or stay in singapore is not a matter of entitlement or a right to be secured by political demand and public pressure
6895227 we are recruiting more staff and streamlining operations and have acquired more equipment and trained more personnel
6895228 will be that anything more than a two month waiting list is unacceptable
6895229 the majority of the couples who come to seek help belong to the middle and upper income groups
6895230 there are actually some lower income patients who come for treatment as well but we can see how the financial constraints affect their decision and increase the stress on them when theyre undergoing the treatment
6895231 we say that on average 10 to 15 per cent of the population of married couples have infertility issues
6895232 if you use this calculation there should be maybe 5 000 or 6 000 people doing ivf but now we only have about 2 000 so what happened to the other 3 000 to 4 000 theoretical ones
6895233 the government has no policy to revoke thaksins red passport
6895234 we have a programme to reward athletes for current and future achievements but we do not have a programme that turns back the clock to reward past achievements
6895235 but id strongly urge those whobelieve that he should also be recognised to show holistic support and give himthe due recognition
6895236 many of the respondents also indicated an intention to leave the industry within the next 12 months citing low pay as the main reason
6895237 passion is what draws people to the profession but there needs to be commensurating salaries for better retention
6895238 better quality and recruiting more qualified teachers may give rise to increased childcare cost
6895239 the most crucial thing we feel is still to raise the profits of operators and increase the salary of teachers
6895240 we also need to rebrand this sector to change the perspective of the general public to preschool teachers in the sector
6895241 it would be a great loss to the industry should they leave due to the lack of qualifications
6895242 it was during the discussions with her about granting access to our members i discussed the option of buying over her clubs
6895243 as we are profitable and cash rich we have no urgency to sell unless the valuation and buyers strategy met with our overall exit plan
6895244 in this current market it is challenging to expand by acquisition without appropriate capitalisation we did the acquisition without leverage and thats an important milestone for us
6895245 during economic hardships rents come down and rentals have been the major killer component in our expansion for the last two years
6895246 unless all the journalists there were lying i dont see why this isnt true the spr election commission needs to call arif shah for an investigation
6895247 if they have misquoted me saying i have been paying so much for votes thats wrong
6895248 its the machinery that is paying those workers who are doing their work
6895249 if they want to make a report they have their right but we are not afraid because we did not do it
6895250 its party policy that in any by election the machinery will come from all over
6895251 the government hopes that the reduction in petrol and diesel prices will help to ease consumers burden as well as ease inflationary pressure
6895252 give me two weeks after aug 26 as i have to gather support from barisan nasional mps to join the pakatan government
6895253 with the development of the integrated resorts we expect more requests for gourmet meat so we need to get our systems ready
6895254 we noted there have been a number of significant improvements the management system of rabies and bird flu has been enhanced
6895255 when anwar wants the malay votes he says one thing when he realises that he needs the chinese and indian votes he is singing a different tune
6895256 how can people believe him it is only a matter of time before people know his true colours
6895257 it was previously given to pkr president wan azizah wan ismail she no longer wants it she gives it to her husband anwar ibrahim
6895258 there still might be one more player to come in
6895259 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
6895260 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
6895261 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
6895262 the only person that let them back into the game was the referee
6895263 i cannot believe he did not give obadin a yellow card for the foul on park tae won in the third minute he should have been sent off but instead he comes to score the equaliser questions have to be asked of the referee
6895264 things could have been different if we played against 10 men you take obadin out of the team and i would say you have reduced their threat by 50 per cent the young lions are surely the favourites now especially if the referees continue to perform the same way
6895265 it is easy to blame the referee but this is all part of the game i guess
6895266 we are just at the halfway stage now and if they can come back from a goal down we can come back too it is never over till the last second
6895267 when petrol and erp prices went up it really put a strain on buyers of cheaper cars who are more price sensitive
6895268 they knew they had to cut their upfront costs because the day to day running costs would be higher
6895269 for sure i will miss the convenience of an automatic especially when im stuck in bad jams
6895270 we started out with very little capital but we have been blessed to have a strong following of customers who have stayed with us even through the asian financial crisis and the sars period
6895271 what i did out there i did for myself my fans and my country i was just trying to have fun out there and doing what i do
6895272 its a great feeling i was really excited to go out there and give usain his third world record
6895273 the two week suspension which will take effect from aug 26 to sept 8 is a clear signal that malpractices in the bunker industry are not tolerated by the authority
6895274 you do look like an older sluttier version of the type of girl we would want
6895275 so i have to learn things about things and stuff about topics
6895276 i like the old design of the coffee house and the fact that it still uses the same furniture as it did when i first came here i also find this place peaceful enough for me to hold a good conversation in
6895277 i used to come here with my parents when i was a child so it holds fond childhood memories for me besides it is conveniently located near my office
6895278 i usually order the hainanese chicken rice bak kut teh or steak with salmon but i especially like the curry chicken as it reminds me of the one i enjoy back home
6895279 we try to keep our overheads low so we can keep prices affordable for our customers and give them value for money
6895280 i guess if you think being rich means you have to make us 5 million 7 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong mr obama said while campaigning in chester virginia
6895281 its seven seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into a narrator says as a picture of the white house appears
6895282 we have actually seen an astonishing number of people who want to be part of the solar industry as they see this as the future oriented society
6895283 in the past 10 years singapore has been diversifying from its core manufacturing sector into other new industries like private wealth management and it has been very successful
6895284 this also means more opportunities for people in singapore to gain diverse experience
6895285 you have a lot of competence in a relatively confined area which was one of the reasons why we decided to go to singapore and you have a lot of experience from creating fast growth industries
6895286 you can always check somebodys background you can never predict the future
6895287 im wondering if he had been an employee of wal mart or rexall drugs or working in a pizza shop if those companies would have gotten that big publicity
6895288 isnt it a natural process for people to give birth and have kids
6895289 worried that the government could just be as clueless as the rest of us on how to solve this social issue of finding a partner
6895290 he was obviously pretty excited about it but she was concerned so she followed up with the company and they said they would never do anything like that
6895291 no wonder john mccain keeps voting against funding the home heating assistance program if he doesnt even know how many houses he has how can he relate to new hampshire families struggling to heat theirs
6895292 everyone is entitled to their own opinion but everyone is not entitled to their own facts
6895293 to accuse someone of being under investigation when they are not is slanderous jeb bradleys desperation to revive his floundering campaign is bringing shame to his reputation and undermining his credibility he should pull down this deceptive ad and start talking about why he would make a good congressman
6895294 jeb bradley ought to be ashamed of himself for running such a dishonest television ad i am outraged that that he would suggest that john stephen in under investigation when he simply is not johns character is impeccable this shows why jeb bradley is everything thats wrong with washington and why we need change
6895295 ive known jeb bradley a long time and for him to falsely imply that someone is under investigation is beyond the pale there is no place in new hampshire politics for this type of thing this should be ceased immediately
6895296 jeb bradley should know that john stephen could not raise his budget by one penny only the legislature can do that
6895297 what john could do is manage his budget once he got it and he returned 143 million to the taxpayers that shows clearly that john is the true fiscal conservative in this race for congress jeb bradley needs to start being honest with the voters not hurling untruthful allegations i understand why he wouldnt want people to know about his record however he needs to get rid of this ad and put up something that is based on real facts
6895298 as commissioner john stephen not only was an advocate for the health and safety of seniors in nursing homes but also a champion for their quality of life
6895299 for too long george bush and john sununu have led america in the wrong direction our men and women in uniform have done everything that has been asked of them and our military presence in iraq is no longer moving the country toward the political reconciliation that it must achieve for itself
6895300 while its long overdue im pleased to see the bush administration has finally realized what the majority of americans have that we need to end the war in iraq and withdraw our troops as safely and quickly as possible
6895301 by quickly and responsibly removing our troops from iraq we can also begin the hard work of rebuilding our alliances and restoring americas reputation in the world
6895302 the devastating mismanaged war in iraq has made us less safe removing our troops from iraq as quickly and safely as possible allows us to focus on the real threat of terrorism in afghanistan and pakistan
6895303 the conditions at the fushan bay in qingdao were difficult with flukey winds and choppy seas which had overwhelmed our sailors
6895304 more time should have been spent getting familiarised with the sailing conditions there despite our sailors having made six trips over two years to the venue
6895305 it was an eye opener for our sailors and singaporesailings management needs to review its plans to level up its training and preparations for futureolympic campaigns
6895306 for example multiple world champion wilmot spent a decade sailing the 470 and just won his first medal at his second olympics
6895307 living it up on a budget 23 wines that deliver outstanding quality for 10 00 or less
6895308 im showing not like minnie driver showing but us pregnant women can explode at any moment and in the best interest of me you and your sneakers lets take a couple of steps back and let move on by

6895316 the united states and ghana enjoy warm relations and a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity in africa and throughout the world
6895317 the two presidents will discuss efforts to combat malaria and neglected tropical diseases as well as ghanas efforts to promote democratic values peace and stability in africa
6895318 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6895319 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6895320 in kindergarten i was told by his teacher michael cant sit still michael cant be quiet michael cant focus
6895321 he read on time but didnt like to read she said
6895322 so i gave him the baltimore sun sports pages even if he just looked at the pictures and read the captions
6895323 this woman said to me your son will never be able to focus on anything
6895324 michael used to run around like a little crazy person mooching food off people
6895325 he could get through homework without moving around as much
6895326 out of the blue he said to me i dont want to do this anymore mum my buddies dont do it i can do this on my own
6895327 but from day 1 i included my children as part of the decision process so i listened
6895328 bob said by 2000 i will be looking for him in the olympic trials
6895329 michaels mind is like a clock he can go into the 200m butterfly knowing he needs to do the first 50m in 24 6s to break the record and can put that time in his head and make his body do 24 6s exactly
6895330 in high school theyd send tapes from his international races
6895331 hed say mum i want to have dinner in front of the tv and watch tapes wed sit and hed critique his races hed study the turns see thats where i lifted my head i couldnt even see what he was talking about i was like whoa
6895332 there were so many things going on at the time the divorce michaels maturity we changed school districts
6895333 were meds the right thing i could be on the fence either way that was the decision that was made

6895340 the bass is deeper the treble tighter the overall effect is a noticeably better listening experience particularly if you listen with headphones or hook up your computer to your tv or home sound system
6895341 they told me that if i did not cooperate with them i would not be able to come back to the u s again
6895342 they apparently have carried out that threat for no reason i was denied a visa when i last tried to visit the u s

6895344 if you try to apply that same technique on the actual tennis court you wouldnt do well
6895345 as a high level tennis player you would like to use your normal tennis strokes to play the game but in a lot of ways that would be a detriment to your wii tennis performance

6895347 kids are afraid to take the ball out of the air or come to the net
6895348 there are some great things that can be learned from tennis games

6895350 these spots were an integral part of our campaign that resulted in a hugely successful launch for in plain sight the ratings were our highest for a new series launch since 2006
6895351 janine evangelistas concepts really came to life with the characters
6895352 there were a lot of nuances in each of their takes and hoerner was able to find the right balance to make very charming spots
6895353 when i watched the dailies for the first time i knew exactly what i was going to do to complement the performances of the actors and make the spots the best they could be
6895354 for an editor it doesnt get much better than a comedy spot if you have good comedic timing that is this was definitely one of the most enjoyable projects ive worked on the client was very open to all of my ideas and in the end very happy with the final cut
6895355 chris has a huge level of experience and it shows in every collaboration
6895356 he doesnt have one signature look and always knows what needs to be done specifically for the project having a go to colorist like chris is beneficial to our company and to the overall production our relationship with him and spy post has worked out so well
6895357 roman and i spent a lot of time creating a colorful and diffused dreamy quality to the wedding scene
6895358 we used cinematic and rich colors like youd see in old films and highlights with a deep focused value to them roman wanted the environment to change in the same way seasons do there was lot of sunlight and warm amber kisses to the trees then the forest becomes desaturated and the skin tones become cooler with the funeral transition but we isolated carrie and maintained a nice quality to her skin
6895359 its been a pleasure working with roman on so many different projects these past few years
6895360 we have a shorthand for how we work and we understand each others aesthetic his technical expertise as a flame amp fx artist allows him to put himself in my shoes theres no need to explain or educate he looks to me to add my own contributions to the project which is a nice validation

6895371 its really hard to get a saying that works for you because you dont want to be irreverent because that offends the living people

6895388 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6895389 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6895390 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6895391 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6895392 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6895393 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6895394 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6895395 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6895396 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6895397 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6895398 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more

6895511 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6895512 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6895513 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6895514 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6895515 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6895516 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6895517 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health

6895716 the irish people should not ignore this conflict in the caucasus as it could have implications for ireland if the lisbon treaty is ever forced upon us
6895717 under the lisbon treaty all eu countries including ireland are obliged to come to the aid of other eu states that are attacked georgia has already applied for eu membership so this is a predicament we could face in the future if the lisbon treaty becomes a reality
6895718 russias war in chechnya was genocide but the present conflict is a different story the georgian government started the present war it carried out attacks on south ossetia in which many civilians and some russian peacekeepers lost their lives this present conflict however is not a simple case of the evil russian empire swallowing up little ossetia rather it is georgia making claims on south ossetia that historically dont hold up encycopaedia britannica 11th ed ossetia borders georgia to the north and it was only during the rule of the soviet union by stalin a georgian that south ossetia came under the control of the soviet republic of georgia after the collapse of the soviet union this became an issue with 70 of the population of south ossetia wanting to be reunited with their fellow countrymen and women in northern ossetia and here the conflict lies

6895725 enfrentar las leyes no es un problema legal es un asunto pol tico y el pueblo lo entiende bien no es ir al tsj para solicitar nulidades consultas o pedir interpretaciones quien quiera hacerlo que lo haga y estamos dispuestos a acompa arlo el problema central detr s de esas normas es que el pueblo est siendo despojado del poder que conquist en la constituci n un poder que conquist no s lo en lo legal sino fundamentalmente en la lucha pol tica y social de los ltimos a os
6895726 las elecciones frenar n definitivamente este proyecto personal que se quiere imponer al pueblo

6895733 nosotros haremos las acciones que tengamos que hacer ya sabemos la manera como fueron impuestas estas leyes que son ideologizantes controladoras y centralistas y ya vimos c mo se ha empezado a actuar con base en ellas disparo primero y averiguo despu s es la ley que est aplicando el gobierno

6895843 vorremmo sapere quali sono i membri designati dalla provincia di firenze nella commissione aeroportuale e quali sono i report che sono stati fatti alla giunta affermano luca ragazzo capogruppo dei verdi in consiglio provinciale annalisa pratesi e tommaso grassi portavoce provinciali dei verdi di firenze poich da quando la commissione aeroportuale si insediata presso laeroporto di firenze l8 giugno 2000 e sono stati indicati i rappresentanti del ministero dellambiente di arpat di enav della societ di gestione aeroportuale delle compagnie aeree della regione toscana della provincia di firenze del comune di firenze e del comune di sesto fiorentino nessuna comunicazione in merito giunta al consiglio o ai gruppi della provincia
6895844 ci sorprenderebbe apprendere che in 8 anni alla provincia nessuno abbia riferito riguardo a quanto dibattuto e deciso della commissione aeroportuale dichiarano gli esponenti del partito dei verdi sicuri per che il rapporto tra membri e provincia vi sia stato sospettiamo che le relazioni si siano limitati alla giunta provinciale senza che ne sia stata data diffusione ai consiglieri e ai cittadini per questo chiediamo a chi e in quali occasioni ufficiali e con quali atti i membri hanno rendicontato le attivit della commissione
6895845 sorprendente stata lassenza della provincia di firenze nella riunione del 25 luglio a roma tra enac enav e una delegazione fiorentina rappresentativa degli enti fiorentini che ha affrontato il tema della tutela del territorio e della salute della popolazione nellintorno aeroportuale affermano i rappresentanti del sole che ride a questo proposito reputando indispensabile limpegno di tutti gli enti locali affinch siano rispettati i tempi e gli impegni assunti durante lincontro a roma chiediamo se lamministrazione provinciale era a conoscenza della riunione ed in caso affermativo quali siano le motivazioni per le quali nessun rappresentante vi ha partecipato e infine quale lopinione in merito agli elementi emersi durante lincontro e come viene valutata la proposta di sperimentare a firenze il protocollo internazionale green team
6895846 inoltre interrogheremo lamministrazione per sapere se anche la provincia non ritenga di dover assumere una scelta simile a quella del comune di firenze che ha scelto come membro designato nella commissione aeroportuale lassessore biagi affermano i verdi della provincia di firenze dunque visto che il dibattito che si sta sviluppando sullaeroporto di peretola del tutto politico vorremmo sapere quale stato lindirizzo e lorientamento politico e tecnico dellamministrazione provinciale che i nominati hanno rappresentato allinterno della commissione aeroportuale
6895847 proponiamo che sia promosso dalla provincia un percorso di approfondimento riguardo alla infrastruttura aeroportuale di peretola che veda il coinvolgimento anche dei cittadini della zona e sia organizzato un incontro della commissione consiliare competente ogniqualvolta la commissione aeroportuale si riunisce chiedono ragazzo pratesi e grassi dei verdi approfondiremo se lamministrazione provinciale ritiene di dover rivendicare e richiedere un ruolo attivo nellapprovazione del piano di risanamento e se intende adoperarsi per controllare il rispetto e lapplicazione delle misure previste nel piano a tutela della salute dei cittadini

6895950 mom bad news im so sorry i didnt anticipate but i dont put milk in my coffee any more so we dont have any in the house
6895951 me gusta las partys tal y como son por las actividades que hay
6895952 me gustan las partys por el buen ambiente de colegueo el intercambio de datos las charlas los torneos etc que tanto nos gustan y luchamos por ello
6895953 against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online
6895954 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6895955 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again that is why he did not start the match two weeks ago against standard liege
6895956 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6895957 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6895958 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions
6895959 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths
6895960 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6895961 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6895962 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6895963 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6895964 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
6895965 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6895966 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6895967 we have had an approach from stoke about sami but we want to keep him
6895968 when we talked about a new contract in the summer it was clear that sami wanted to stay at the club
6895969 he is a fantastic professional a very nice person and a great player he is not a player we want to sell
6895970 marcos wants to stay but he wants to feel valued
6895971 he has two years left but for him it would be an important step if villarreal were to offer him a new deal
6895972 fenerbahces offer is worth a lot of money many millions they want to build a strong side and aragones knows what marcos is capable of
6895973 weve spoken to villarreal and ive made them understand that were talking about a special case because hes an important player whos being chased by a team with a lot of money
6895974 renewing his contract to better it would make him calm
6895975 i can say and i am saying that villarreal are the team in my heart they opened the doors to europe to me and what i want to do is stay here
6895976 these five points are priceless and we have to keep this lead or extend it
6895977 we must put our whole hearts into this phase of the tournament the players cant claim tiredness
6895978 we fight and run but we miss clear chances to score and when we do that the rivals tie the match in the next attack no matter if they didnt set foot in our box before that
6895979 the fans have the right to protest but i believe that at this moment we need the total support of them
6895980 we have this team until the end of the year and things are not going to change now we need stamina to beat portuguesa on sunday this is the only way to fight for the brasileirao title
6895981 it is a nice cliche but in the derbies there isnt a favourite
6895982 the maracana is a neutral field and both sides achieved historic results there it will be a very tough match as vasco have a powerful attack
6895983 we still didnt clinch four or five consecutive triumphs now we have the chance to do it we hope to travel to curitiba and return with a good result

6895999 should i sleep with my recruiter i think she likes me
6896000 im afraid because this person is getting mad at me
6896001 if she gets angry the sky is going to fall down
6896002 if she gets mad and hangs up before i get what i need this search is going to be shot to hell and everyones going to be mad at me and i wont be able to earn a living and im going to lose my house and thats going to be a total disaster
6896003 all you needs a strong heart and nerves of steel
6896004 you finally got a real corporate recruiter on the show
6896005 we were baffled at the severe lack of knowledge on the roma which at the same time seemed to be responsible for the survival of old prejudices towards this people
6896006 of all the projects i have done so far i feel that the roma journeys was the most involving and intense and we went very deep into the subject it became the main thing in our lives for the last seven years
6896007 it was our own interest that initially took us to the roma streets in hevesaranyos in north east hungary romania india and our travels in finland came about through personal contact while in greece and russia we were assisted by human rights organisations
6896008 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the position as agreed
6896009 it is imperative that russian forces fully and speedily implement and abide by the commitments that it has made

6896016 americans seem glamorous when youre growing up in scotland you people had cars homes jobs and all your own teeth
6896017 but i did read a lot of british comics when i was very young the stuff was weird in hindsight a football strip called billys boots about a young lad possessed by a dead footballer whenever he tied up the laces on his old boots
6896018 if i said it was a commentary on violence id be sniggering at the same time because lets face it when you write a scene about a bullet taking four panels to pass through a human head you arent thinking about the social commentary
6896019 you just think it looks fucking cool real violence is obviously horrible but these are comic characters or highly paid actors its great watching bad shit happen to them
6896020 moore said all that after finding his greatest success with watchmen one of the darkest books of his generation theres a certain guilt that seems to hit creators after taking these characters to the max but the weird truth is that the greatest sales and greatest excitement comes from the dark stuff my own experience is that the darker you make the material the more popular it is both creatively and commercially who am i but a humble writer i cant argue with the readers

6896030 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6896031 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6896032 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6896033 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6896034 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it

6896042 it was kind of like the perfect storm every little thing that could have happened went wrong we had such a good start to the season but i think the big boys got tired out they played pretty hard our big line of jason spezza dany heatley and daniel alfredsson the league is so good now theres so much parity i think last year when we started struggling some guys tried to work too hard and then everyones on their own page and thats kind of the way it unravelled he hartsburg is going to take control of the room pretty good and just make sure we do things right get the proper rest and be ready i think they team management knew the big boys got pretty tired last season so they want to make sure we get four lines going because teams that win now have four full lines

6896052 this would have been an opportunity to just open the steps up and really go for broke and i think we were just a little bit conservative and 38 66 in any other given day is a pretty good time but not in an olympic final
6896053 weve got some work to do but this team will be back im satisfied were here but you know im not satisfied were not on the podium
6896054 i have mixed feelings obviously you know its great to be here in beijing competing and you know ive certainly proved over the years that i am part of a world class field but i definitely didnt perform the way that id hoped today so definitely a little bit of disappointment there

6896079 if there is a view that for various political reasons we should not be there or what we are trying to do should be altered which cannot be then we would necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we need to move
6896080 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore we will not move then they are wrong we would move whatever the cost to protect our people what has concerned us is the violence and the disruption that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and of the viability of the entire process

6896083 great loss to the company its shareholders and west bengal
6896084 we came at a time when there was very little investment coming to west bengal and the tata motors decided to locate one of their prime and most unique factory in west bengal we wanted to showcase the new industrialisation of west bengal
6896085 we leased property which was offered to us that had been acquired and as we were looking for a unique product with low cost we wanted an integrated location as logistics and transportation are major components of cost for any project we are trying to produce a car that has never been tried anywhere in the world at that kind of price
6896086 the ministry agreed but we have no say as to whose works are included in the exhibition
6896087 in the first art summit you exclude the most prominent artist just because some people have objected to his work it doesnt make any sense so as a mark of solidarity we are showing some 10 20 paintings of husain
6896088 it is the first indian art summit where so many artists are showcasing their work husain is a very important artist of india and he should also have been represented here political parties have nothing to do with art they have no understanding of it politicising art is very sad
6896089 from what i have read it is terrible husain is much too important a person not only as an artist but also a global cultural figure for this to have happened the whole nature of the physical threats to culture is that you have to stand up against it it is the only way to protect the freedom of expression which is the actual minimum for art to freely express itself
6896090 we put this photo because of husains exclusion if this is not a safe place to show husain then where is it it is a matter of freedom of expression he has been censored and is in exile if the art fraternity is not going to support him then who will

6896112 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting

6896126 the initial impression of this circus was somewhat promising until the marquee lit up
6896127 i just read the posts about iousa i am quite familiar with bonner and wiggins work and went to see the film because they were involved i was quite disappointed not so much surprised but disappointed
6896128 it started out ok with an amusing clip with steve martin
6896129 there was also an unintentionally amusing part later they portrayed bill clinton as an heroic paragon of fiscal responsibility which caused a significant portion of the theater to literally laugh out loud
6896130 the theme for the movie can be summed up in one section
6896131 the message of the movie is clear the state is in trouble and it is time for all good americans to come to its aid by paying more taxes and saving more money by force if need be
6896132 we were shown clips from the 40s of various celebrities encouraging americans to buy bonds we were told that our parents and grandparents faced similar crisis and pulled together to pay higher taxes and buy govt bonds
6896133 in case anyone missed it the point was driven home several times during the panel discussion which was worse than the movie

6896141 the team were brilliant this evening the whole day they were pretty good
6896142 the boys did a good job today i asked a lot of the lads i think there are a few areas we can still improve but all round i cant blame anyone
6896143 theres no point resting on our laurels though it is a long series still four more games to play
6896144 we always start well and we end up messing it up a bit so i think nottingham on tuesday is a huge fixture for us
6896145 he came back into the team and what we asked of him he delivered again it was a big plus for steve and big pluses for all the boys they played brilliantly today
6896146 for steve to make a u turn at the last hour was magnificent and he delivered today
6896147 i dont think we played our best one day game of the last two years
6896148 we showed a lot of rustiness throughout and the fact is we havent had the greatest build up to this series
6896149 there is a lot to improve on before nottingham we were way below par we know we can improve a hell of a lot and that is encouraging for us

6896152 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6896153 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6896154 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6896155 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6896156 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6896157 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6896158 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6896159 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6896160 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6896161 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6896162 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6896163 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6896164 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6896165 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6896166 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6896167 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6896168 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6896169 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her

6896173 there were reports coming out on the shortage of arvs in districts like katakwi pallisa rakai soroti hoima and luwero a number of people living with hiv aids were reporting complete stocks out or breaks of one week to months without medication yet drugs were expiring in the stores

6896176 casey doesnt really have a calm center he has an angry center
6896177 there is no cause for alarm and the shortage will not last for long
6896178 the current shortage has nothing to do with the ministry of health some of the factories delivering first line drugs have failed to deliver but they have assured us that they are addressing the problem
6896179 two months ago we got communication from one of the manufacturers that they would not meet the demand
6896180 the companies manufacturing these drugs informed us that they were not getting the raw materials in sufficient amounts to meet the worldwide demand for arvs
6896181 we are delivering the first batch of the drugs ordered by the ministry of health next week
6896182 the country has been implementing pmtct since 2000 but the regiments that we are using in uganda dont reduce mother to child transmission mtct markedly
6896183 today research has shown us that if all hiv pregnant mothers are given a triple combination of arvs we can reduce mtct to almost 1
6896184 now that more resources are available we are advocating for a triple combination this is being done in developing countries

6896250 the end result is a current information technology system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
6896251 there has been no degradation in the capability to access manage and share terrorist information during the life of the railhead program
6896252 on the whole its a lot better way to do things
6896253 the death note live action film wowed audiences when it screened theatrically in the united states earlier this year and as the popularity of the manga and anime series have spread we are very pleased to debut the film to canadian audiences
6896254 inspired by its manga and animated counterparts the live action death note film combines the best aspects of suspenseful crime dramas like heat seven and sea of love with supernatural plot elements to make for a very unique story we encourage fans will take advantage of the special death note advance ticket bundle to secure a seat at the screening and a copy of the dvd
6896255 cineplex entertainment is very pleased to provide this one night only canadian screening of the death note live action feature film to our guests across the country
6896256 we are also excited to offer our guests the opportunity to experience this movie first on the big screen as well as offer them the added bonus of a dvd copy to take home with them
6896257 live action adaptations of popular graphic novels animated series and comics are this years box office darlings we expect this to continue with death note which will definitely be a hit with those familiar with the franchise but we also anticipate it will be enjoyed by a wider audience much in the way that hido nakatas films were

6896259 mijn critici huldigen de stelling je kunt de allochtonen vreemdelingen plus nieuwe belgen en hun kinderen dv svg niet exact tellen dus kun je zeker niets voorspellen en moet je erover zwijgen ik huldig een andere wetenschapsopvatting het verleden in kaart brengen om het heden te begrijpen en om een toekomstgericht beleid te voeren ten dienste van de mensen
6896260 wij berekenden hoeveel de gelijkschakeling van de lonen van verzorgend en verplegend personeel in de rusthuizen met de lonen in de ziekenhuizen ging kosten cijfers die de werkgevers noch de ministeri le kabinetten hadden
6896261 ik zocht in 2005 naar informatie om mijn gegevens van 1990 te updaten groot was mijn verbazing dat er in dit land geen enkel officieel centrum voor demografie meer is dat zich voluit met actuele dataverzameling en migraties bezighoudt
6896262 niet de gebruikelijke vlaamse definitie die erop neerkomt dat een allochtoon kansarm moet zijn en dus meestal van niet europese vaak van turkse of marokkaanse herkomst is onder allochtonen versta ik alle vreemdelingen ook fransen en austra li rs plus de nieuwe belgen en hun kinderen
6896263 wat voor de arbeiders en vrouwenbeweging gold geldt ook voor de allochtonen
6896264 nu is al 59 procent van de hoofdstedelingen van vreemde afkomst in een halve eeuw tijd is er een geweldige switch geweest in 1960 was nog meer dan negentig procent van de brusselaars autochtoon in 2020 voorspel ik dat dit nog maar een kwart is
6896265 de toekomst van de vlamingen in brussel staat of valt met de allochtoon vlaanderen moet zijn onderwijsbudget in brussel de komende jaren verdubbelen nu heeft het nederlandstalig onderwijs een marktaandeel van 20 25 procent we moeten streven naar een aandeel van 40 procent te beginnen bij de kindjes die nu naar de kleuterschool gaan en dat aandeel in een tijdspanne van twaalf jaar uitbouwen tot het laatste jaar secundair dat zijn de toekomstige ketjes
6896266 om de band met de ouders te onderhouden en nieuwe leerlingen aan te trekken zo laten we zien dat we de allochtonen voor vol aanzien en kunnen die jongeren een eigen identiteit uitbouwen
6896267 in bepaalde gemeenten zoals molenbeek bepaald geen kleine gemeente is de helft van de bevolking van marokkaanse origine ze vormen een enorm potentieel
6896268 en met de marokkanen worden alle allochtonen in een positieve dynamiek betrokken
6896269 ook hierin kan brussel het voortouw nemen de islamitische godsdienst kan evenwaardig binnen dit religieuze net opgenomen worden en op gelijke voet behandeld met de katholieke anders is de uitbouw van een islamitisch net zelfs gewenst
6896270 ik weet dat karl marx gezegd heeft dat godsdienst opium voor het volk is maar hij heeft ook gezegd dat godsdienst een protest is tegen de ellende veroorzaakt door de maatschappelijke orde
6896271 nu is fouad ahidar vl pro als enige allochtoon verkozen in de raad van de vlaamse gemeenschapscommissie vgc
6896272 de brusselaars van vreemde afkomst maakten in 2006 57 procent van de bevolking uit ze hebben 26 procent van de gekozenen de autochtone franstaligen haalden met 36 procent van de bevolking 63 procent van de politieke mandaten de autochtone nederlandstaligen met zeven procent hebben er elf procent het aandeel van de vlamingen moet je niet afmeten aan het geheel van de bevolking maar wel tegenover de autochtone franstaligen
6896273 in de negentiende eeuw lieten franse dichters paul verlaine pierre lou s louis perceau hun erotische po zie in brussel drukken
6896274 de vrijheid van gedachte is in brussel altijd gekoesterd net als de bescherming van minderheden
6896275 joden die in antwerpen woonden hadden van heel belgi de grootste kans om gedeporteerd te worden verhuizen van antwerpen naar brussel verdubbelde hun overlevingskansen
6896276 god where is the one that i am meant to be with
6896277 exactly what they said was that if the dalai lama comes to costa rica hu jintao wont come and thats not convenient for costa rica
6896278 for the defence of life human rights and staying in this territory
6896279 how much money you borrow to be able to repay it or not
6896280 the rnc and the dnc thats one of their things that they do
6896281 they converge hundreds of people into these cities and they like to leave something nice behind thats why the conventions are involved
6896282 they saw us and they said what a perfect way to give back
6896283 we had to seek out some vets to say we have this wonderful opportunity
6896284 theres not much democrats and republicans agree on but we all agree on supporting our troops
6896285 thats why the democratic and republican national conventions are proud to join homes for our troops in building specially adapted new homes in denver and minneapolis st paul for a seriously wounded servicemember and their family from each of these communities
6896286 these figures show that if house building continues at this slow pace the government will not meet its target to build 70 000 social homes over the next three years and will fall way behind on its three million homes by 2020 pledge
6896287 spending this 8 billion now rather than over three years makes perfect economic sense
6896288 the government simply cannot stand by and watch the industry collapse or it could take 10 years for house building in britain to recover ruining any chance of first time buyers getting onto the property ladder and destroying the governments own promise to build three million new homes by 2020
6896289 nosotros quienes conformamos el grupo de evang licos laicos del ecuador queremos expresar a usted nuestro m s sincero respaldo a la labor que realiza en beneficio de la vida y nuestra familia en nuestra comunidad ecuatoriana

6896300 en un pa s mayoritariamente de religi n ortodoxa explica monse or pasotto ha causado sensaci n que el jefe de la iglesia cat lica se interesara de manera tan decidida por el conflicto en curso y que tuviera en el coraz n a la poblaci n georgiana y rezara por ella
6896301 ha provocado el p nico entre la poblaci n tambi n en zonas no afectadas como la capital haciendo resurgir de repente los dolorosos recuerdos del conflicto de hace 18 a os con abjacia
6896302 ha sido muy hermoso observar c mo las familias de la capital han hecho de todo para llevar lo que pod an a los refugiados llegados de repente y que no ten an ni siquiera un colch n para acostarse
6896303 los refugiados sigue relatando monse or pasotto entre 80 000 y 90 000 est n diseminados en doscientos puntos de acogida de la ciudad los primeros d as permanec an completamente en silencio no pod an pronunciar palabra ayer los j venes de la parroquia se acercaron a un centro para ofrecer actividades a los ni os y han constatado que las mujeres est n reaccionando pero los hombres permanecen a n en silencio
6896304 a n hay tensi n no se entiende por qu a pesar de lo acordado est todo bloqueado y uno no puede andar por donde quiere
6896305 tanto el gobierno georgiano como el patriarcado ortodoxo explica el prelado han pedido ayuda a la iglesia cat lica y estamos haciendo todo lo posible con un gran esp ritu de colaboraci n
6896306 ha habido momentos de encuentro muy hermosos afirma monse or pasotto es importante en situaciones como sta sentirse unidos m s all de las diferencias de la fe
6896307 ahora asegura monse or pasotto no faltan las ayudas internacionales pero la situaci n de precariedad amenaza con durar mucho ya se dice que las escuelas no abrir n porque est n todas ocupadas por los refugiados
6896308 quiz s algunos de ellos puedan volver a gori pero no a tsjinvali ser necesario reconstruir las casas y vigilar para que todos reciban ayuda y no se olvide a nadie que est necesitado despu s de siete u ocho meses se recordar a n a georgia
6896309 es necesario que no se limiten a buscar el sensacionalismo sino que obren el bien para ayudar a los que sufren y que den una informaci n lo m s correcta posible
6896310 todays reports of russian military withdrawal appear to be a step forward to implement these commitments
6896311 but i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre august 7 position as agreed
6896312 i told them it was a private party and to clear off but this big youth put his face right into mine and said make me
6896313 as i tackled him six of them came over the top of me i received a big hit to the side of my head
6896314 there were six or seven really big buff guys on top of my dad hitting him i had to try and pull him out
6896315 i am certainly not a hero i just defended my property and my sons friends there were a group of 15 year old girls there too
6896316 people have had enough this gang has been terrorising people whose kids are having parties for months now somebody needed to stand up to them
6896317 i know that if dad had not stood up to them they would have completely trashed the house and stolen anything they could get their hands on
6896318 all i would suggest if a situation arises again leave it to the police to handle
6896319 i would gladly do it again they picked on the wrong guy
6896320 we know we are more than just neurons firing or at least we think we are while the neurons are firing
6896321 indefinite fast for tibet without food or water to represent the plight of the six million tibetans

6896325 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6896326 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6896327 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
6896328 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit

6896339 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
6896340 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
6896341 nosotros ten amos cierta cantidad de asientos que disminuyeron porque el vuelo que tiene escala en resistencia ahora suma a los pasajeros correntinos pediremos ver esta situaci n como tambi n la posibilidad de que otros vuelos que llegan a puerto iguaz hagan escala en posadas
6896342 dentro del esquema de privatizaciones de la d cada del 90 falt una pata importante como lo es el control
6896343 estamos trabajando en la incorporaci n de un rgano de control que dependa nicamente del estado
6896344 por supuesto que el estado estuvo ausente en el control de un servicio de estas caracter sticas aerol neas y que adem s a trav s de una revisi n not tambi n que en el tren de cargas hay irregularidades ya que las v as no est n en condiciones no se han hecho ning n tipo de mantenimiento y ha usufructuado el beneficio de la concesi n
6896345 el tren de pasajeros que viene a posadas circula sin siquiera la autorizaci n de la secretar a de transporte
6896346 yo creo que va a ser con la misma intensidad porque en el senado se refleja una realidad que es la representatividad de todas las provincias y yo creo que aqu va el plato fuerte
6896347 run run its a beaver the most intimidating mascot ever
6896348 well probably have to take a few deep breaths and say all right here we are
6896349 two elections ago we probably wouldnt be taking a group like this and be able to do what were going to do
6896350 im not nervous at all about what theyre going to produce
6896351 i feel that were going to knock it out of the park
6896352 meeting with christian groups and leaders in public is perfectly appropriate for political candidates
6896353 but meeting with religious leaders behind closed doors only raises serious suspicions about the candidates commitment to defending the first amendment and the separation of church and state promised therein the timing of the meetings only make matters worse in that it appears like he is making a secret pact for their support in the upcoming election season
6896354 we call on all of the presidential candidates to take a strong stand in defending the first amendment and to avoid questions of complicity and quid pro quo special favors from religious leaders
6896355 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute
6896356 i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equal
6896357 whose public acts are responsible to all groups and obligated to none
6896358 i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me
6896359 atheists are trying to remove god from the public square
6896360 removing god from the schools is a cause of our moral decline
6896361 to proclaim the gospel truth of salvation in jesus christ
6896362 there are good reasons for the separation of church and state
6896363 and by appearing in this forum the two candidates and the two political parties are clearly showing a preference for the religious practices and beliefs and the political agendas derived from those beliefs represented by this church and its pastor the church and its pastor couldnt buy better coverage to promote its own narrow sectarian message
6896364 certainly the evangelicals are an important voting block and i dont fault the candidates for courting them but the impropriety of scheduling this as the first joint appearance of the two candidates in this historic election whether its officially a debate or not demonstrates a lack of commitment to the separation of church and state and highlights the disproportional ascendancy of evangelicals in our political process
6896365 can god create a stone so heavy he couldnt lift it

6896383 bene quella di torino stata unesperienza positiva per me anche se lannata stata difficoltosa per la squadra
6896384 difficile capirlo la squadra ha avuto qualche problema legato agli infortuni stata una stagione disgraziata da questo punto di vista in particolare nel girone dandata a un certo punto cerano pochi giocatori presunti titolari a disposizione e questo ha influito negativamente sullannata del torino
6896385 assolutamente s per me stata una scelta importante che mi ha portato in una piazza prestigiosa e di forte richiamo per questo sono stato comunque contento dellesperienza di torino nonostante le difficolt incontrate dalla squadra
6896386 lavorando con novellino ho potuto capire il suo calcio e mi ha dato molto a livello caratteriale oltre ad avermi concesso la possibilit di giocare in ruoli diversi da quello di terzino sinistro con lui ho scoperto la mia duttilit de biasi arrivato in un momento molto difficile per la squadra e ha saputo dare a tutti la tranquillit necessaria per portare a termine la stagione
6896387 da fuori difficile capire certe dinamiche il torino una squadra importante e penso che possa fare un buon campionato sar determinante per loro partire bene quella granata una piazza umorale e iniziare col piede giusto pu essere daiuto per vivere una stagione positiva
6896388 conoscendo la societ e molti giocatori penso che possa vivere unannata positiva da squadra rompiscatole del campionato spesso il chievo parte godendo di poco credito per poi riuscire per a fare meglio di quanto fosse nelle previsioni di molti addetti ai lavori credo che questa societ per le proprie capacit e qualit morali sia tornata nella categoria che merita
6896389 molto positivo qui c un grande entusiasmo per il ritorno in serie a e questo dovr essere un valore aggiunto per affrontare un campionato che sar sicuramente duro e difficile ma nel quale penso che il bologna possa recitare un ruolo importante e togliersi belle soddisfazioni
6896390 il pi in forma in questo periodo adailton che ha colpi importanti da mettere nuovamente in mostra in serie a poi mi ha colpito bernacci allesordio in a ma se prende fiducia nei propri mezzi che sono notevoli penso possa fare il salto di qualit e imporsi anche in massima serie
6896391 bene uno che parla molto con i giocatori ha le idee chiare e sa trasmettere al gruppo la necessaria unit dintenti per vivere un campionato positivo
6896392 da un lato lesordio col milan difficile per il valore tecnico dei rossoneri ma dallaltro pu essere un bene per noi avere un simile battesimo in campionato a san siro il bologna avr poco da perdere laspetto psicologico sar il migliore possibile e c la possibilit di ottenere subito un risultato di prestigio inoltre incontrare presto le grandi squadre penso sia meglio che non quando terminato il rodaggio iniziale sono al massimo della forma sono qui da poco ma lobiettivo di squadra per una neopromossa senzaltro quello di confermare la categoria insomma salvarci nel pi breve tempo possibile

6896813 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6896814 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6896815 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6896832 i thought it would be on the market for about 300 000 and it was offered to me last friday for 3 2 million or 3 5 million
6896833 allow the market to set the price and well see great gains and great prosperity in the long run if we just allow the market to set the price
6896834 the prices that im seeing are breathtaking as the way they are excalating and our cost

6896842 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here

6896847 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6896848 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6896849 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6896850 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6896851 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6896852 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6896853 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6896854 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6896855 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6896856 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place

6896925 i suspect that the elite jackson hole crew will not be debating whether greenspan was the greatest central banker of all time this year the world is now facing the most serious financial crisis since the great depression thats not my assessment those were the words of alan greenspan
6896926 and how did we get here well the centrepiece in this story is that the united states allowed an 8tn housing bubble to grow unchecked
6896927 between 1996 and 2006 house prices rose by more than 70 after adjusting for inflation in the previous century from 1896 to 1996 house prices had just kept even with the overall rate of inflation when you suddenly see a sharp divergence from a long term trend like this it is reasonable to look for an explanation
6896928 if the run up in house prices could not be explained by the fundamentals then it was a bubble which would burst this was easy to see for anyone who cared to look but greenspan and his sycophants could not be bothered greenspan insisted that everything was fine there was no housing bubble and virtually the whole economics profession acted as enablers touting greenspans wisdom

6897008 m xico se puede dar el lujo de jugar fuera cuando quiera porque tiene la capacidad en los jugadores para sacar los resultados
6897009 como mexicano y como jugador siempre jugar en el azteca es imponente y si tenemos ese handicap de nuestro lado creo que todos los partidos tenemos que aprovecharlos porque siempre es una oportunidad y un paso adelante de los rivales para estar en el mundial
6897010 lo estamos tomando con calma porque no debemos precipitarnos sabemos que los partidos y el trabajo nos va dar el ritmo que necesitamos para jugar como queremos como en el segundo tiempo de pachuca que con 10 hombres tuvimos un par de oportunidades adem s que el equipo mostr mucha entrega y mucha actitud
6897011 por supuesto que jaguares es un rival siempre complicado siempre contra nosotros viene jugando bien y sin duda est n en busca de resultados de un triunfo que lo necesitan bastante y nosotros como locales tenemos que proponer tenemos que ir en busca de los tres puntos porque tambi n los necesitamos para seguir en la pelea

6897013 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6897014 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6897015 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic

6897021 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6897022 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6897023 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6897024 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6897025 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6897026 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6897027 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6897028 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard

6897033 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6897034 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6897035 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6897036 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6897037 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6897038 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6897039 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6897040 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6897041 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6897042 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude

6897074 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
6897075 personally im not worried they stole my video or made profit out of it im rather more disgusted by the fact that they used a video of real life event that caused death of two people to pay tribute to a movie
6897076 mock the explosion or take advantage of an incident where two people died
6897077 i was in toronto to witness the incident but unfortunately did not record the footage
6897078 since all my viewers knew i was in toronto for the youtube gathering i thought it would be a pretty cool and clever idea to re enact myself witnessing the event

6897088 dnssec has suffered from a chicken and the egg problem for many years
6897089 domain owners that sign their zones have no guarantee that an end user will actually receive the authentic dns data and not some forged data from an attacker the only way the end user will be protected from forged data is if the isp is dnssec enabled and can validate the answer from a signed domain but isps have no reason to enable dnssec unless there are actually signed zones out there to validate
6897090 to achieve scalability of up to hundreds of thousands of zones and millions of records signer employs high speed cryptographic algorithms that provide over 6 000 rsa operations per second with a 1024 bit key
6897091 in addition signer can be configured to sign zones either in bulk or incrementally making it possible to deploy it in the largest and most dynamic environments without compromising existing update intervals
6897092 with seven million names in org it would be a significant strengthening of the core infrastructure on the internet if org had the base that would allow for dnssec to be supported

6897247 to date in practice victims of ec antitrust infringements only rarely obtain reparation of the harm suffered the amount of compensation that these victims are forgoing is is in the range of several billion euros a year
6897248 there is a clear need for mechanisms allowing aggregation of the individual claims of victims in antitrust infringements individual consumers but also small businesses especially those who have suffered scattered and relatively low value damage are often deterred from bringing an individual action for damages by the costs delays uncertainties risks and burdens involved as a result many of these victims remain uncompensated

6897438 freedomland the pulitzer nominated drama by local playwright amy freed in the outdoor setting of theatre in the woods
6897439 for me im able to be persuaded and often if i believe that the evidence is strong then im happy to change my mind and thats what ive done
6897440 the job of the police association now will be to monitor the transition from the antiquated revolver to the semi automatic pistol
6897441 we hope that transition will occur in a timely manner
6897442 the current revolver goes back to the days of gallipoli
6897443 we are going to see a mass shooting in tasmania unless we get national gun control laws
6897444 i became aware that the only 2 local police were dispatched to saltwater river i was chatting to the nubeena policeman and he told me where he was when the shooting began his name is paul hyland the other policeman was stationed at dunalley he would back up hyland as they were told heroin soap powder was found at saltwater river
6897445 this meant that the only 2 local police were at least 25 minutes away from port arthur very convenient i dont know when where or who rang and alerted the police to this so called heroin haul
6897446 i know it should have been on tape but i went to hobart about a week after the shooting to a meeting of the ambulance service a comment was made to me that the tape recordings of the days events had been accidentally wiped the chap who told me was a senior ambulance officer i travelled with him to the meeting and it was during this journey that i was given this information
6897447 would also prevent anyone from leaving the peninsula including those involved in executing the massacre at port arthur
6897448 the bridge remained open to traffic after the massacre and several people are known to have left port arthur and escaped across that swing bridge
6897449 there was some suggestion that there may be two suspects it appeared at one stage that two gunmen or some people or hostages at seascape were exchanging gunfire with the gunmen as there appeared to be shots coming from two separate buildings

6897457 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6897458 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6897459 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6897460 dimos un gran paso hacia sud frica 2010 no tenemos nada asegurado ni ganado pero lo que hicimos en estos juegos ol mpicos fue un paso importante no se ha ganado nada a n pero hemos avanzado bastante y el objetivo que es sud frica esperamos que se cumpla

6897462 america is a generous nation and where america provides assistance during times of human tragedy it changes attitudes about us
6897463 it reflects the best of america and it advances well being around the world the center for global health policy will greatly further these honorable ideals
6897464 recent successes in addressing hiv aids and malaria demonstrate the critical role of informed public policy in improving global health
6897465 funding is important but it has to be directed wisely in order to have a real and lasting impact the new csis center will help develop a comprehensive global health strategy that uses the financial technical and political resources of the u s as effectively as possible
6897466 there is a major opportunity for the united states to take leadership on the issue of global public health and a major opportunity for the united states to help itself by doing good around the world
6897467 i am looking forward to working with the gates foundation to put the csis center for global health policy at the forefront of that effort
6897468 as animals are considered objects in china there is little or no awareness for the suffering of these sentient beings
6897469 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6897470 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6897471 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6897472 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6897473 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6897474 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view
6897475 they struggle and try to fight back to the very end even after their skin has been stripped off breathing heart beat directional body and eyelid movements were evident for five to 10 minutes
6897476 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6897477 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy

6897479 luis es un jugador que ha sido determinante sobre todo que ha ido mejorando en esta ltima etapa y se encuentra mejor que en el semestre pasado ha tenido mayor regularidad mayor compromiso y eso se ha reflejado en la cancha donde nos ha dado una cuota importante en la parte ofensiva
6897480 es encarador tiene gol tiene potencia es r pido aunque aparentemente no lo es pero cuando encarara lucho se lleva por delante a defensores y tiene la explosi n en la ltima zona que es importante

6897482 in palmerston north im not hearing its time for a change for changes sake
6897483 a lot of people are undecided they want to see what everybody has on the table come campaign time
6897484 i enjoy talking to people about why i believe what i believe
6897485 there are no quick fixes for those things but we can provide a sense of stability and security
6897486 we have the interests of families and workers at heart
6897487 the better that start is for children the better theyll do later in life
6897488 we have to be seen to be at the leading edge of dealing with climate change issues in order for our products to still have a viable market overseas
6897489 it would appear on polling that national will be the major party after the election but i dont think it will get enough votes to govern alone
6897490 were doing the 1957 pipeline thats the one we think has more sediment in it
6897491 one might just award nbcs online presentation of the summer olympics a bronze medal then

6897501 have been sealed unnecessarily and unjustly withheld from the public
6897502 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6897503 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6897504 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6897505 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6897506 theres no secret to doing all of this except working 12 hour days
6897507 you dont do this for the money its a lifestyle

6897521 when i was growing up i was enamored with this one friend she had the most beautiful complexion and skin and strawberrylike lips
6897522 i kissed a girl was inspired when i opened up a magazine and i saw a picture of scarlett johansson
6897523 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
6897524 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray

6897561 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6897562 if somebody thinks that people will be satisfied after musharrafs removal let me tell you that people want the rule of law
6897563 mccain would make a fatal mistake to assume that social issues especially abortion are ever off an equally blazing front burner for an inestimable number of social conservatives the republicans most reliable voting bloc over the past three decades
6897564 with all due respect senator mccain you may not rule tom ridge out but if you choose him youre virtually guaranteed of ruling yourself out
6897565 not only is the vice president the presidents immediate successor if the president dies or becomes incapacitated but also mccains selection of a pro abortionist candidate would send a message grossly undermining the republican partys uncompromising commitment to the lives of the unborn
6897566 democratic presidential nominee barack obama had galvanized the right on saturday night when he lived up to at least half of his bestsellers name he had the audacity to question supreme court justice clarence thomass credentials during saddleback megachurch pastor rick warrens candidate forum
6897567 as obama was riling up conservatives with his attacks on thomas mccain reassured them about his administrations commitment to life
6897568 mccains avowed recognition that life begins at conception and his forthright commitment to a pro life presidency stood in stark contrast to obamas weak and insulting answers about when life begins
6897569 and john mccain could well undo all of that political momentum the republican presidential nominee gained from obamas missteps this weekend
6897570 if that candidate is joe lieberman as is widely believed that would mean that john mccain is willing to share his ticket with a senator who refused to oppose a ban on partial birth abortion
6897571 if john mccain picks joe lieberman as his running mate he would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
6897572 russia has one of the lowest birth rates in the world at 1 17 children per woman
6897573 a nation needs a birth rate of 2 1 just to replace current population
6897574 because of its low birth rate and early deaths due to disease and other factors russia is losing approximately 750 000 people a year
6897575 so where does a nation with a plummeting birthrate find people how will russia hold the largest land mass of any country in the world with a population of 115 million or 77 million where will it get the labor to fuel its economy and man its defenses
6897576 doubtless moscow would also benefit from the thriving economies of georgia and the ukraine as well georgias economy increased by 12 in 2007 while the ukraines grew by 7
6897577 but what oil rich russia needs now more than anything else is more people this may be a significant factor driving its adventurism in the caucuses
6897578 my suspicion is given what the men have been through there is not a lot theyre afraid of
6897579 i dont think what is happening now is right and fair to the government and the united states
6897580 the unique sacrifices sgt nelson has made for all of us that we all live under the blanket of freedom he provides with the blood that flows through his veins
6897581 look at the purple heart on this decorated mans chest
6897582 nothing that is said in this courtroom can be used down at camp pendleton
6897583 im not doing this all myself youre doing one and weemer is doing one
6897584 this case was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
6897585 the physicians in this case had determined to only provide in vitro fertilization to married patients thats hardly a novel or extreme ethical position
6897586 physicians of course must treat all patients with compassion and respect regardless of the belief systems or sexual norms of the patients
6897587 but tolerance is a two way street we must also respect the right of healthcare professionals to make decisions based on ethical standards
6897588 this court decision like so many others in which the courts have waded into areas exceeding their proper reach violates long established principles of medical ethics
6897589 even the american medical association officially affirms that neither physician hospital nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles
6897590 the overreaching court decision also conflicts with federal laws protecting right of conscience and with the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals to exercise their conscientiously held moral beliefs
6897591 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
6897592 when faced with the decision to choose between conscience and providing a medical service physicians of conscience are most likely to stop providing this service rather than violate their conscience
6897593 are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6897594 an increased focus on system wide risks by regulators and supervisors is inevitable and desirable
6897595 we should be careful about over promising as we are still rather far from having the capacity to implement such an approach in a thorough going way
6897596 the congress should consider granting the federal reserve explicit oversight authority for systemically important payment and settlement systems
6897597 remain focused on addressing the current risks to economic and financial stability
6897598 its certainly a solution to the issue of how much you can see and hear of the practices
6897599 that being said are we going to evaluate that and consider it weve always said that but we dont have a proposal dont have an agreement dont have a contract beyond the 2008 game
6897600 i havent had the opportunity to talk to ron about either the extension of that series in st louis or perhaps going to home and home sites
6897601 we prefer seven home games but it is harder to schedule with a neutral site game missouri we like the arrangement in st louis and we recruit there we have a 1 million guarantee before we get into the revenue sharing part a decision has to be made in 2011 and well work with missouri on it
6897602 i talk to ron all the time about things but this hasnt been something thats been on the radar screen
6897603 good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment
6897604 on average they have been asking for a 7 percent increase
6897605 as americans drive less because of the price of gas fewer claims will be filed with insurance companies
6897606 whether this will mean windfall profits for insurers or rate cuts for the consumers is up to governors and state regulators to determine
6897607 a lot of them say we dont regulate rates so we dont care
6897608 higher inflation and the commodities price boom increases the cost of steel plastic paint aluminum copper and everything else used to repair a vehicle
6897609 when prices have been low theres pressure for them to go up

6897634 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6897635 it is my understanding that they russian forces have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6897636 the completion of the order to pull out from georgian territory russian troops sent to reinforce peacekeepers
6897637 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout

6897646 if we knew anyone sensible they would have told us not to do it
6897647 we see it a bit like brigadoon where a little village pops up every couple of years
6897648 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy which means they would support roe v wade
6897649 has lost the support of some in the pro choice community
6897650 i think we need to have a ticket that supports the tenets of roe v wade and that is where he has lost the support of some of the pro choice community
6897651 the supreme court is currently effectively deadlocked on the life issues
6897652 if a pro lifer were to take the white house in 2009 he would have the opportunity to fill up to three supreme court seats with judges who share his views creating a strong majority on the court
6897653 the illinois senators prospective judicial appointments as outlined in the national journal are not only pro choice but zealously so
6897654 mccain has consistently voted to confirm pro life judges and insists that men like john roberts and samuel alito would be his models when choosing candidates
6897655 he co sponsored the infamous freedom of choice act a bill that would have swept aside all pro life laws to ensure that abortion on demand without restrictions or conditions remains the law of the land
6897656 while an illinois senator he voted to increase taxpayer funding of abortion and consistently opposed parental notification laws he also opposed legislation against partial birth abortion enthusiastically supported embryonic stem cell research and even voted against anti infanticide legislation in illinois
6897657 he has a 100 pro life voting record having consistently over decades cast votes in defense of the unborn
6897658 the abortion issue has never been mccains thing but if his rhetoric does not show passion his record does show quiet consistency
6897659 he would turn the abortion issue over to the states supports parental notification laws and ban on partial birth abortion and opposes tax funded abortion and human cloning
6897660 this puts him head and shoulders above obama whose radical pro abortion stance and his inflammatory rhetoric on the issue clearly place him at the pro abortion extreme of his party
6897661 mccain may be only a pragmatic moderate on the pro life issue or he may be a little more but obama clearly is rabidly pro abortion
6897662 we are delighted that bob detrick will be joining nsf in this important national leadership role

6897671 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing
6897672 when negotiations are hopefully coming to an end when you can see the end in sight there are a lot of details that have to be worked out and i think were in the process of working out details right now
6897673 the two discussed the agreement we are currently working on with the iraqis and agreed that our teams would continue those discussions
6897674 all militias were driven out and the town is now controlled by the islamists

6897682 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
6897683 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
6897684 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
6897685 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
6897686 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern
6897687 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
6897688 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics
6897689 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry
6897690 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects
6897691 its expensive and a little difficult to manage but we still think theres good value for the right film at venice
6897692 we took sleuth there last year and it performed incredibly well in italy france and spain and i think the venice launch had a lot to do with that theres nothing like a red carpet event in venice if youve got the right stars but if you dont it can be difficult
6897693 venice doesnt even help much to launch our films in italy let alone anywhere else
6897694 our italian distributor bim was willing to have the film in rome over venice mainly for timing issues better time to release the film in october in italy and secondarily for costs consideration
6897695 thats a factor for a lot of distributors and sales companies acquisitions people go more to toronto where there are more sidebars and product what you manage to accomplish at cannes and to a lesser extent at venice is a great junket but in venice the hotels are obscenely expensive and not very good it costs a fortune to rent interview space and the service is appalling then youve got the cost of boats because all the really big stars want to stay at the cipriani
6897696 i feel im hurting my distributors by tempting them to go with these festival films for which theres no economy today
6897697 the festival community is changing and separating from the market
6897698 theres a whole world of people going to festivals with films that do the rounds pick up awards and take their screening fees but never get sold
6897699 theres a recession and the uncertainty over video on demand at cannes people complained that there wasnt much new product but thats because the old stuff hasnt shifted
6897700 there are films that are never bought by anybody but trickle around from festival to festival
6897701 if a sales agent has six films in a festival three will never get sold
6897702 its not a huge business its a small business provided you keep your costs down
6897703 when we started new wave we thought wed do two films a year but then we couldnt stop and now weve got 10 everyone gets a bit carried away with festival fever buying is easy releasing them is the tough part
6897704 the business is driven by passion but there is a model that works
6897705 our films are press driven and the press starts at film festivals
6897706 in spain there is competition but the market has come down a lot in value italy is really difficult at the moment france is ok germany is so so japan is still tough and the usa is a nightmare
6897707 in italy unlike in the u k a lot of distributors have been working hard to build this market for 20 years so you cannot say theres more interest now its the same as always just a few films make it to a large audience a few to a nice audience and most dont make it at all
6897708 television is no longer there in italy the tv buyers are more picky so we are more picky
6897709 with space on tv limited the increasing cost of promotions and the fact that just a few make it at the box office you have to be extremely selective about what you choose
6897710 what is doing really well is arthouse but lighter films like irina palm caramel couscous the lives of others people want to be entertained uplifted but in an intelligent way
6897711 itll be good because you get tired of looking at an old building

6897715 international olympic committee head wonk jacques rogge criticized jamaican sprinter usain bolt for his actions in the 100 meter dash for disrespecting other competitors criticism of bolt is deserved but not from rogge not from this fraud i mean rogge was doing this in a country that disrespects the human rights of its citizens hel lo and chicago wants this rogge character to bring his international brand of hypocrisy and greed here in 2016

6897735 theres a little part of you that yeah youre ticked because youre competing against these guys and theyre trying to bend the rules
6897736 youre just also envious and mad that you didnt think of it yourself you know what i mean i dont think anything less of them because everybodys trying and sometimes you think more of people unfortunately its not a great example to set but sometimes the creativity of the situation makes it a little bit admirable in a sense
6897737 theyre running for owners points i assume but theyve not necessarily got a driver title out there so its hard to really kind of hit them where it hurts with that deal
6897738 i dont think really anything they did hurt them all that much other than the personnel losses and the embarrassment obviously
6897739 team owner joe gibbs takes a lot of pride in his deal and i believe what he says when he says hes upset and i believe what he says when he says hes going to take action on his own but it really doesnt take away from them on a performance deal
6897740 it was just obvious blatant cheating and a unique circumstance too on the chassis dyno and i feel like that that deserved a unique style of punishment
6897741 i think hes a solid race driver i like his attitude hes just got the right attitude when it comes to racing hes a racer thats what i like about him
6897742 theres a lot of guys that havent won when you look at it
6897743 theyre definitely a sponsor that gets behind the driver and they get behind the sport
6897744 it just goes to show their commitment not only to nascar but more importantly to michael waltrip racing
6897745 working on getting him the other half of the sponsorship package signed as well
6897746 our relationship with toyota stipulates that we are a three car organization
6897747 if you look at what michael has done he has done everything weve asked
6897748 hes been right there hes qualified for races hes done fine
6897749 we plan on michael returning to the car at richmond then continuing the development the companies that were talking to he is our guy he is the guy we are selling so were planning on him being the driver
6897750 i think that its fair to say if im michael mcdowell and i know that this car today doesnt have a sponsor on it ive always known thats the key to the whole process so if it doesnt you need to weight your options
6897751 but as i say hes the guy were selling to the sponsors as the driver for that car
6897752 i mean yeah its a morale boost maybe if youre finishing top five all the way up to the chase but that can be derailed in two races anyway
6897753 itd be a lot more fun to have more wins under our belt getting into the chase but weve got a lot now and hopefully we can still get some in the chase
6897754 i love the extra off week and i love that weve extended the season out an extra week
6897755 i think that was very smart because ive always said that i felt like that long stretch we have all the way from the middle of july all the way to november is too long we should have a break prior to the chase add comment
6897756 consideration of the value of music in the year 2008
6897757 you sound really clear but you just need to turn it up
6897758 he cant socialize he has to work and then he comes back to the jail to pay his way back at the jail
6897759 hes done everything that he could do to be required of him
6897760 its important that people in the community as well as the victims families feel that some sort of semblance of justice has occurred in this case
6897761 anything i would do i would want the families blessing

6897766 i cant do this this isnt working lets just be friends
6897767 de certa maneira bom que o time esteja falando com algu m como alonso que tem muito experi ncia e bons times no curr culo
6897768 aproveitei as tr s horas de treinos livres hoje para completar muitas voltas e obter diversas informa es que ser o teis no restante do fim de semana gostei bastante do circuito divertido pilotar nele
6897769 a ader ncia estava baixa mas estamos acostumados a esse tipo de coisa em circuitos de rua agora vou trabalhar com meus engenheiros para otimizar o
6897770 eu vi um time completamente desfigurado nada parecido com o atl tico at na falta de garra de luta
6897771 eu conversei ontem quinta feira com os jogadores conversei ontem quinta feira tamb m com a comiss o t cnica e aqui estou para cobrar uma posi o mais firme n s temos que caminhar hora de ganhar n s precisamos ganhar domingo
6897772 yes i am aware that michael phelps is rumored to be dating some australian ho bag
6897773 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell its been separated from its mother and it is confused i have never seen anything like this
6897774 it has been a comedy of errors all week and i cant understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6897775 theres an even chance of the company coming cap in hand to investors
6897776 if economic conditions get tougher theyll be up against it and itd be no surprise if in six months they need to ask investors for money
6897777 we should never say no to a rights issue but it has not been on my mind
6897778 joguei no ano passado na vila belmiro e sei que as dimens es s o menores com a torcida ali bem pr xima
6897779 o nosso comportamento vai de acordo como o adilson quer tenho certeza de que ele vai montar um esquema favor vel para que possamos ganhar l dentro
6897780 quando o santos joga dentro de casa na vila belmiro a bola fica mais r pida e o time deles procura imprimir velocidade
6897781 temos a chance de entrar para a hist ria e encerrar o segundo ciclo ol mpico perfeito
6897782 eles t m um jogo consistente e teremos que jogar melhor do que estamos jogando
6897783 quando ela voltou do problema do doping n o sab amos se voltaria a ser a maurren de sempre
6897784 mas com os resultados do primeiro ano de seu retorno t nhamos a certeza de que ela seria uma atleta ol mpica talvez n o de ouro mas uma grande atleta
6897785 antes da competi o ela come ou a criar um estado mental vencedor e assumiu de maneira contida o favoritismo
6897786 a maurren sabia que para fazer com que tudo isso acontecesse tinha que dar o melhor e se preparou para isso
6897787 no futebol o bom momento pode chegar ao fim num nico segundo de falta de aten o por isso precisamos ficar ligados pois muitos falaram ao longo da semana que o chelsea o time a ser batido e o efeito disso para n s n o positivo pois nossos rivais entrar o em campo muito mais motivados respeitamos muito o wigan um jogo fora de casa e n o podemos nos descuidar
6897788 vamos dispostos a ganhar mesmo fora de casa ter uma boa arrancada no campeonato ingl s que muito disputado algo sempre muito importante
6897789 fa o isso constantemente n o foi uma novidade no treinamento d impress o que n o fazemos o que estamos acostumados que esse trabalho t tico de posicionamento continuamos fazendo as mesmas coisas e n o podemos parar porque tomamos ou n o os gols
6897790 estava tudo ensaiadinho mas na pr tica n o deu certo
6897791 conversamos com eles antecipadamente porque dentro do jogo n o d o importante o jogador ir para campo com a informa o e isso tem acontecido tanto que eles declararam isso depois do jogo falta um pouco de concentra o de acreditar que a bola vai chegar coisas do futebol que j estamos trabalhando
6897792 n o foi diferente no campeonato paulista fui cobrado do mesmo jeito quando comecei com o henrique e o outro gustavo e n s ganhamos o t tulo
6897793 essa coisa passa batido para mim o palmeiras est na terceira coloca o e esquecem que esses gols s o virtudes do advers rio e uma falta de entrosamento nosso
6897794 i just have to work hard and do the best that i can i have no idea which direction theyre going
6897795 when you look up look ahead and see thats the guy you have to score against its like ah its going to be a tough day
6897796 it took my awhile to get going to understand everything
6897797 i knew that if we could just get some of the rough edges off
6897798 he wouldnt be where hes at if he didnt work i only gave him the book to read chris read the book
6897799 hes not looking like a goalkeeper that makes a lot of rash decisions at the beginning of last season i really felt like he was a little bit too eager in making some poor game time decisions tactical decisions and now he looks like hes learning and not making those types of errors anymore
6897800 every time i go in they tell me keep working keep doing the things youre doing
6897801 he listens he learns he keeps his mouth shut and he works hard hes the next big thing
6897802 it was just a matter of what i wanted to do with it i have the size i have everything its just that i have to be mentally strong and go with it learn every day take everything you can from everyone and use it
6897803 there were no positives in these data a collapse in investment a contraction in household demand and a fall in exports
6897804 the uk looks almost certain to head into recession in the coming quarters things will be considerably worse in 2009
6897805 for years gordon brown has boasted of consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst
6897806 we are now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6897807 chacun sa courge et les vaches seront bien gard es
6897808 i would like to advertise there but everyone in the world would see my ad it would be wasted
6897809 the people of the book divided in their religion into seventy two groups and this ummah will divide into seventy three groups all of which are destined for hell fire but one which is the group al jama ah
6897810 yeah but i dont want our patrons to throw up so i better not
6897811 he doesnt seem to be releasing a lot of information about his parents
6897812 we saw the film recently in london and marc forster daniel craig and the entire team at eon have truly delivered another extraordinary bond adventure
6897813 quantum of solace is a seamless continuation of the storyline that began with the last film we believe november 14th is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas the bond films have a long history of entertaining audiences in this holiday corridor going back to goldeneye in 1995 the studio enjoyed tremendous success opening casino royale in north america on november 17 2006 and we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday
6897814 ive been a daily marijuana smoker for most of my adult life my boss recently started drug testing all his employees i was expecting to lose my job but i found your book on the internet thank you so much i passed and i was confident that i would pass going into the testing lab
6897815 shows a tone deafness to the cuban american communitys concerns
6897816 every four years for at least the last 20 years some media and some pollsters always predict that the democrats are going to make inroads with cuban americans
6897817 perhaps one day that might be true but i dont think this is the case now barack obama is not the kind of candidate for a people who tend to be very traditional in their values and very hawkish in their foreign policy support
6897818 what i sense in the community is a much stronger concern about an obama presidency among cuban americans than anything i remember in john kerrys campaign
6897819 clinton had a more hard line approach to dealing with the cuban dictator than george h w bush
6897820 i dont think cuban americans are necessarily voting exclusively on cuban policy anymore
6897821 traditionally voting exclusively on cuban policy has been the case what you are seeing is that the problems that are affecting average americans like the economy or the war in iraq are also affecting cuban americans
6897822 has nothing to do with elian gonzalez or greg craig
6897823 the elian gonzalez scuttlebutt was a republican stunt quite frankly
6897824 im not denying that it was effective before but people are wise to that trick
6897825 i dont think that the cuban american community is going to put their trust in obama in terms of cuban politics
6897826 i love barack im telling you hes a wonderful guy
6897827 getting access to tell your story is a factor of who you get to know people know people they have friends when youre trying to break in if your father is the chairman or you have a friend from college or you have a frat brother in the company
6897828 they might not have ever thought to include blackwell consulting
6897829 in 2006 the chicago tribune reported that mrs obamas compensation at the university of chicago hospital where she is a vice president for community affairs jumped from 121 910 in 2004 just before her husband was elected to the senate to 316 962 in 2005 just after he took office
6897830 any implication that sen obama would risk an ethical breach in order to secure a small grant for a pingpong tournament is nuts
6897831 the 2002 and 2003 events were among the largest ever table tennis events held on u s soil in terms of attendance
6897832 thousands of hours of domestic and international exposure via espn additionally hundreds of hotel rooms were occupied all three years that the state supported the event
6897833 to catching up on work at the law practice that id left unattended during the campaign a neglect that had left me more or less broke
6897834 his personal financial situation was not and is not my concern
6897835 i hired barack because he is a brilliant person and a lawyer with great insight and judgment
6897836 barack worked extensive hours advising the company on compliance and human resource issues
6897837 i would say you should disclose that to protect and insulate yourself against the charge that you are concealing it
6897838 was a more complete disclosure than you see 80 of the time in illinois
6897839 he was especially mindful of this responsibility as a leader of ethics reform
6897840 as democrats and americans we yield to no one in our commitment to do everything necessary to win the war on terror
6897841 a global terrorist movement of many groups funded from different sources and with separate agendas but all committed to assaulting the united states and free and open societies around the globe
6897842 i wouldnt say he talks about it all that frequently
6897843 al qaedas intent to attack the u s homeland remains undiminished
6897844 is identifying training and positioning operatives for attacks in the west likely including in the united states
6897845 when you think about obamas vulnerabilities and his need to capture wavering democrats and swing voters questions about whether he is strong enough and patriotic enough are definitely on the table
6897846 the challenge is showing the american people on a deep deep level that terrorism is a core issue and youre really passionate about this obama has to show and the democrats have to show that they are passionately opposed to and disgusted by terrorism
6897847 about all the things bush did right in the war on terrorism after i had explained where i agree with him then i would talk about where i disagree
6897848 i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america
6897849 right now our brave men and women in uniform are fighting two different wars while terrorists plot their next attack
6897850 i know that barack obama is a near perfect political package im still not sure though whats in it
6897851 the number of hnis high net worth individuals in india is growing at a fast er pace than in any other nation
6897852 rise to 583 million by 2025 the number of indians with wealth exceeding 100 000 is forecast to be 29 million by 2017
6897853 he has already bought it from what i know they have bought three properties in the uk all of them large villas recently of course the actual prices have not been disclosed but all the three are residential properties and in kensington
6897854 nobody knows anything about it they said he had something in delhi and it turned out that he didnt have these are all rumours confirmation on who has bought what where is very difficult to get because these things are done very discreetly
6897855 the first of their kind in india by uk property developers
6897856 of course the price of properties in central london is much higher but the point is that when you buy a south mumbai or south delhi property those prices are not going to decline lack of supply pushes prices up in such places
6897857 the uk is a very stable and mature property market and these people know that even if the market takes a downturn their property value will not come down more than 8 9 per cent a year if it goes up it will be more than that the uk represents a very amenable market for indian investors the british pound is far more stable than the rupee there is far greater transparency in the uk real estate market uk tenants sign long leases of up to 25 years and their long term income generation capacities are extremely stable not to forget the london olympics in 2012 these factors are of great importance to investors in such projects
6897858 oh they are very emotional buyers the purchase doesnt have to be an investment all the time it is like yar ek ghar chahiye hamey waha par jab hum retire ho jayengey aur hamarey doston ko milney jayenge tau waha rehney key liye ek ghar chahiye i just need a house to stay when after retirement i visit my friends there the other trait of indian buyers is that i want a piece of london
6897859 they have their children studying in the uk and want to spend their summers with their children there ive just had a client who is buying a 2 million three bedroom apartment in central london because his son is studying there he is a businessman from delhi and a very high net worth individual
6897860 they are tired of staying in hotels and want an apartment where they can get service basically that of a concierge youve got your clothes there so you just take your laptop and business bag and fly out to london stay there and return
6897861 they already have a holiday home in india and now aspire to buy something in the uk many of our hnis go at least once or twice a year to the uk for a holiday and from there they travel to other places in europe like spain portugal greece switzerland making london their base
6897862 like somebody told me that when i go to geneva waha mujhe bhendi packet me milti hai i can buy ladies finger only in a packet but in the uk i can buy it fresh its surprising to hear such emotions but you really understand it only after meeting these people
6897863 they know that they can go to a restaurant and ask for food without onions or garlic or say that today is tuesday so no meat for me please
6897864 not really except for vaastu they want north east facing properties and they dont need vaastu experts either they know all about vaastu and know exactly what they want
6897865 each project is fdi compliant fifteen are being developed and six are in the pipeline
6897866 the mpc group is bullish on the indian economy as the indian consumer is now confident and willing to spend the indian hospitality space also offers tremendous growth opportunities even in tire ii cities where the consumers have latent spending power and is still untapped by quality retail products
6897867 fifteen projects have been currently identified where approximately 70 of the investment will be deployed and six more are in the pipeline which will be consuming approximately 30 of the investment
6897868 there are some large investors who take positions on aim such as hedge funds and pension funds but since liquidity has been low their interest has weaned away for the first half of this year there have hardly been any companies tapping aim but as global markets revive the condition will improve some of the issues have been deferred too
6897869 one good lawyer said to another we need a change in washington and in tallahassee
6897870 may 2007 is a classic blues album but presented with a modern twist
6897871 barack obama has taken no position that offends his own party

6898305 am anfang hatte ich schon ein wenig angst in dieser h he zu arbeiten
6898306 nach meinem fach abi erz hlte mir ein freund von der praktikantenstelle weil ich kameramann werden will habe ich mich beworben ganz klassisch mit lebenslauf und motivationsschreiben
6898307 nur beim ersten mal hatte ich angst erregt zu werden
6898308 wenn es hart zur sache geht stehe ich schon mal kurz vorm kollabieren
6898309 es ist das erste mal dass ein ufergrundst ck privatisiert wurde
6898310 rainer b ttcher ist ein berechenbarer partner es gibt keinen nachvollziehbaren grund dieses grundst ck nicht an ihn zu ver u ern
6898311 die fotoausstellung und die einschl gige berichterstattung dar ber haben sich auf einseitige und verleumderische informationen bezogen die tibet politik chinas diffamiert statt die positive entwicklung in tibet anzuerkennen dabei wird china die verfolgung und sogar t tung der unschuldigen tibeter vorgeworfen diese vorw rfe weist die chinesische botschaft in deutschland entschieden zur ck
6898312 wir hoffen dass sie das separatistische wesen der dalai lama gruppe durchschauen und ihren l gen keinen glauben schenken
6898313 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6898314 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6898315 da die hamburger polizei unver ndert einer versetzung nicht zustimmt m ssten sie nach feststellung ihrer eignung und kl rung aller voraussetzungen auf der grundlage einer einstellungszusage ihre entlassung aus dem beamtenverh ltnis gegen ber dem land hamburg beantragen
6898316 wer auf diese in der geschichte der bundesrepublik beispiellose art und weise die solidarit t der l nder aufk ndigt spielt in unverantwortlicher weise mit den sicherheitsinteressen der eigenen b rger
6898317 bei der innenministerkonferenz im herbst 2007 in berlin gab es eine vereinbarung dass bis zu 40 beamte nach berlin zur ckgeholt werden d rfen der polizeipr sident setzt diese vereinbarung nur um und genie t unsere r ckendeckung
6898318 es ging um maximal 10 h rtef lle und da werden wir nat rlich kooperativ sein es ging keinesfalls um 40 oder 50 beamte

6898323 wir rechnen nach abschluss der drei bauphasen mit j hrlich 1 5 mio besuchern
6898324 zu jedem haus geh ren mindestens 500 qm grundst ck so dass jeder genug privatsph re hat
6898325 die ersten online spiele zeigen dass das internet hindernisse wie beispielsweise zeitzonen verschwinden l sst und fans 24 stunden am tag sieben tage die woche zugang zu aktuellen inhalten und videos haben
6898326 online nachrichten informationen und nicht zuletzt videos erm glichten fans weltweit die erstaunliche leistung zu verfolgen und dabei zu sein w hrend geschichte geschrieben wurde

6898330 die wurzel liegt in der komplizierten hartz iv gesetzeslage der unzureichenden ausbildung zu vieler mitarbeiter und vor allem im mangelhaften computerprogramm der jobcenter
6898331 bis wir ein neues computerprogramm bekommen wird es allerdings noch bis 2012 dauern
6898332 existenzielle f lle wurden in wenigen wochen bearbeitet aber klagen von unfallopfern rentnern und kranken ziehen sich bis zu vier jahre hin
6898333 in sp testens drei jahren sehe ich mich auch im olympiastadion mario barth ist f r mich wie domino day er hat vorgelegt jetzt hei t es mit einer anderen location nachzulegen

6898356 this is for my grandfather who died in july im very sad about it hes been there for me my whole life but now im sure he is happy
6898357 it was fun painting on a 60 foot canvas on the floor painting with brooms but it was stressful working in that environment there were always deadlines and few weekends off my progression towards sculpture was gradual first i was doing lots of pictures of stones and stone objects in the middle of the landscape such as standing stones then i visited yorkshire sculpture park and saw barbara hepworths work shortly afterwards i saw a course advertised at morley college and enrolled from then on i was really hooked i respond to the stone i start work straight into the stone rough it out remove stone quickly to give a working shape get rid of excess stone using a mallet and point then move on to a claw chisel and shape the stone more tightly after a few days i can see a bit i want to get rid of and the shape gradually emerges usually i work on two or three pieces at the same time its like a dialogue with the stone with something that has its own energy whereas with painting youre building up from a blank canvas
6898358 not sandstone because theres too much dust and you need proper masks and extractor fans not harder stones like granite because theres too much vibration too much impact on the bones i like soapstones you can get a high polish and lovely colours and alabaster and portland and purbeck limestone in 2005 the discerning eye was bought by the mall galleries and from that time on ive spent 80 of my time on sculpture maybe just doing one painting a year i think theres a spiritual quality about sculpture and i can be more abstract and personal than i could be with painting in the series touching forms for example i was thinking about the idea of relationships how people are separate but also have a joint identity the two forms appear to come together and move apart
6898359 its called the family treeo the childrens choice of title and consists of three figures a mother a father and a child for that i worked with year 9 and 10 pupils from the radcliffe school and it was officially opened in june 2008 im also helping an infant and nursery school in braintree to design mosaics and a bench for their new school garden
6898360 hi jon got the pedal yesterday and really like it my current fuzz face was a fulltone 69 but the fuzz haze beats in it my book it has better bass response and more gain thanks again
6898361 hey jon got the fuzz haze last night just got to play with it just a little but wow cool dry wide buzzing fuzz hendrix cream i have a t rex alberta that i got at rudys here in ny paid 200 and something for it and never use it but youre stone bender and fuzz haze do and will all the time they go well with my vox mccoy wah and mxr phase 90 and now with the fuzz haze my rm octavia has a purpose thanks till next time
6898362 thanks jon the strange master sounds great thank you for your support and im sorry for snow balling you with annoying questions
6898363 hi jon the strange master sounds great with my rig i will try to send you some stage sounds next week in mp3 format i am very pleased and will highly recommend this pedal to all
6898364 the stone bender works perfectly and sounds fantastic congrats on your achievement you have produced a really excellent pedal here this sounds really close to the early jimmy page sound imo
6898365 thanks jon i love the stone bender it sounds great the quality is very good i bought it because i like the concept of having a vintage pedal design with optional modifications my rig is all vintage analog gear and the stone bender is a perfect fit

6898370 iowa workers deserve a healthy and safe workplace and continued new and repeat violations by the same company creates a negative view of iowa employers
6898371 as we have explained to the state our efforts involving employee safety are a top priority and we will continue to add to our safety initiative
6898372 any conclusion that the number of alleged violations indicates that the plant has widespread safety issues would be completely wrong
6898373 for instance eight of the alleged violations relate to one extension cord
6898374 as to the specific findings of the july inspection almost all of the safety issues identified were remedied the day of the inspection the remaining few issues were corrected in a matter of days thereafter
6898375 we contest some of the alleged violations and believe the label of serious is not appropriate for many of the alleged violations
6898376 our goal however is to create a work environment which is completely safe for all employees in the past few months we have made great strides in strengthening our safety compliance efforts we have enlisted the assistance of a former osha agent and expert in work safety matters we have significantly enhanced our safety training programs we have developed a practice of safety discussions by the supervisors with the employees in the plant and we have set up an anonymous tip line and encouraged employees to either tell their supervisor or call the tip line if they see safety issues
6898377 in fact this resistance is so robust that they can be exposed multiple times even through blood transfusions from people who have hiv and they dont get infected
6898378 was to find a way to disable this gatekeeper in a way similar to people who are born those fortunate few who have a natural immunity to the virus
6898379 were able to switch on or switch off the expression of essentially any gene in the human genome
6898380 a zinc finger nuclease can be designed so that it will find literally a needle in a haystack one gene out of 30 000
6898381 this is the first time you could induce a permanent resistance of cells to the hiv virus
6898382 the way we would normally do this is we would have to treat animals or people every day with medications and this is a permanent treatment where after this one time the introduction of cells that have this hiv gatekeeper were able to fight off the virus the other problem with the current therapies is that there are side effects
6898383 and those side effects are sometimes so severe that the patients have to stop taking medication and then those patients really have no alternative
6898384 its the block to hiv entry into the cells it would normally enter
6898385 its like you put the virus in and it goes into the cells dna and it stays there
6898386 were actually using a viral vector based on a common cold virus called the adenovirus
6898387 the reason we chose it is that other than having a viral coat on the outside its a vector that does not integrate into the genome so its rarely used in gene therapy applications these days because it only provides such a transient delivery mode but in our case because we only need a transient delivery mode it has the right characteristics for us
6898388 the zfps are introduced they carry out this genetic change its permanent but the carrier the vector that gets the zfps into the cell and the zfps themselves are washed out and so what goes back into the patient is a modified cell that doesnt have either the vector or the zfps in it anymore
6898389 in the long term if this passes the first safety hurdles well then test the safety of giving multiple blood transfusions of immune cells
6898390 and if we can find that that approach is safe as well then the next step would be to do this in their bone marrow cells so that the whole body would then become repopulated with cells that have natural resistance to hiv virus

6898432 ultimately its utterly unnecessary there are other ways of generating energy its not difficult to be slightly more efficient than the old power stations
6898433 in the same amount of time and for less money we could implement an energy system that will do far more to stop climate change and ensure energy security than nuclear or coal fired power a combination of renewables efficiency and combined heat and power

6898620 you are not going to get anything out of me on the vice president
6898621 hillary clinton is certainly in the mix and the only person who knows the winner is barack obama
6898622 brings enormous credibility and experience in terms of national security and washington
6898623 somebody who is independent who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6898624 im not going to ask you about being vice president
6898625 im going to be president but i think its going to be of something like the eagan rotary club someday
6898626 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials was a charade was a travesty of justice
6898627 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6898628 it looks like hes got some decent numbers against left handers and hey were going to run into a few here and there including saturday versus jon lester he can play third he can play second and he can play the outfield
6898629 weve done the whole midi creation thing we think we can do something really ambitious and really great thats going to speak across all the users of the game not just hardcore users and that will result in some awesome stuff and not just final fantasy covers

6898631 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
6898632 its very cynical even more so when you understand that in many african american demographics gun homicides are the number one cause of death
6898633 to have these people use the history of discrimination against african americans going back 140 years to say this is why we need to have guns in churches restaurants and schools where is this going to end
6898634 there is a connection there is no doubt about it
6898635 horrible stories to justify why the legislature and the courts should allow for easier access to guns
6898636 its very disingenuous and it is not appropriate to link these horrible massacres to what they are doing in 2008
6898637 we need less guns on the street rather than more guns if you took the guns off the street particularly in african american hispanic and poor white communities the homicides would drop dramatically
6898638 the gun violence that is occurring there is not happening with the people who are going through background checks its happening with people who already have a criminal history
6898639 if they have a criminal history particularly a violent criminal history then we dont want them carrying a weapon

6898642 he doesnt know how he did it and i cant pick it up on video
6898643 he is going for another scan and touch wood its not too serious but its not something you can put a time frame on
6898644 it could even be the end of his world cup hopes which would be pretty disappointing for him because he was setting his sights on that hes pretty ambitious
6898645 a girl said to me in bed last night youre a pervert
6898646 we will listen again to their understanding of indonesia and our understanding of malaysia and why these two nations can easily be provoked over issues concerning the other
6898647 we see that our relations with malaysia should have gone further and should not be based on ethnic group sentimentality
6898648 what is the cost of an intermediate range ballistic missle
6898649 i want to start again coz i cocked it up
6898650 i used to be hot and i really should have taken advantage of that when i was hot and my body would have made me heaps of cash
6898651 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
6898652 we really like sushi and wed take home fish samples and put them in alcohol
6898653 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6898654 ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6898655 i dont care about accessibility because it is not needed for my users
6898656 that in the real software market you dont have time for that
6898657 oh look using ajax in a stupid way is not a good idea
6898658 consider the users you want to reach before using a technology that may not be appropriate
6898659 i don t care about accessibility because it is not needed for my users
6898660 if the wrong thing happened to you today tomorrow you could need accessible design to do your job
6898661 a girl said to me in bed last night youre a pervert
6898662 i was being a deviant and can you get it out

6898665 work was supposed to have started before the end of the year and we wont even be close to seeing a bidder selected the way things have been going
6898666 i think telstras assessment phil burgess thought it might not be until september next year before things start happening he may be well right
6898667 in this fog of confusion and behind closed doors wheeling and dealing broadband users and telecommunications companies and the national interest is all just left wondering when it will get a look in in this very confusing process
6898668 im hungry for petes sake its 7 30 and im pregnant
6898669 you can have it now but read them first before you eat them geesh
6898670 would you just wait and see what happens she seemed pretty okay with it
6898671 while dancing with another girl to a lively barney song the girls accidentally bumped heads and she got a red spot on her forehead
6898672 misunderstanding what playing kung fu meant she became angry at the boy for kicking her so she picked up a long handled sand shovel and hit him across the shoulders
6898673 you worry so much that youre doing the right thing when theyre growing up
6898674 you catalog every little thing you did wrong and wonder how much you scarred them then theyre grown and happy functioning as productive members of society and you think whew i did okay then they freak out over cantaloupe and you realize that you didnt even have fruit on the radar screen of therapy fodder
6898675 you are just gloating fruit issues hell my younger girl is obsessed with having a penis and the older one still zones out on us focusing on her fingers having conversations with each other i would pay big money to know that their worst parenting story will be about my dedication to healthy produce not a day goes by that i dont buy an expensive avocado and think that the money would probably be better spent going into the therapy fund
6898676 youre right the penis thing is a lot worse than cantaloupe that really helped
6898677 but now shes older she lets you style it right
6898678 thats right honey now are you ready to start your calendar first we need to write in the numbers
6898679 oops wait a second joellene lets look at the example again
6898680 its okay honey just erase it see heres an eraser just rub it off and you can rewrite it
6898681 oh no now its smearing look mrs amy its all smeared
6898682 ive decided im going to quit dance class i dont want to do it anymore
6898683 but youve just started dance class and we just bought you all the dance clothes and the ballerina bag
6898684 peanut i was very clear when we went to the dance store that if we bought all that stuff youd need to stay in dance for at least a few months
6898685 and what will you do when i have to go to a meeting
6898686 thats not going to work mama isnt allowed to take kids to meetings besides i think youll have more fun playing with your friends
6898687 where did you go i thought you were setting the table
6898688 oh i decided to quit daddy i dont feel like setting the table anymore
6898689 peanut you cant just quit something when you dont feel like doing it look at mama what would happen if she decided she wanted to quit making dinner every night what if she stopped right now said i quit and never cooked again why wed starve wed never get any food to eat
6898690 id uh probably cook you know uh toast or something
6898691 but hush thats not the point dont get us off track
6898692 you can set the table and go to dance class and learning lions and everything else you commit to doing
6898693 to put party politics ahead of the interest of the people she was elected to represent
6898694 im not going to come crawling back im not going to make a deal to crawl back im there and im going to make the best of it
6898695 nicole youre a rock star i love you and just keep it up
6898696 i believe it was done because she went in holding the speaker hostage on voting on this budget there are two things you do when you are in the majority party when you are in this assembly one is vote on your leader and two is vote on the budget because the budget has been negotiated amongst democrats and it represents the majoritys negotiated budget
6898697 republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left
6898698 if the state has to find money legislators will take it from us legislators are unwilling to make any cuts
6898699 weve got to do more with less or the same amount with less
6898700 we need to step out of the current energy crisis and end the partisan bickering a combination of increasing our own domestic supply and reducing demand will lower energy costs and create new jobs getting us through a transition period during the next 20 years it is also vital that our nation move toward clean and renewable sources of energy this is a big test for our country and its leadership that we cannot afford to fail
6898701 i believe a season of change brings the opportunity to dream about the days immediately ahead of us and the longer term
6898702 high school reform is definitely something that every major urban center is going through and part of that is academies we have a 54 percent dropout rate in stockton if we dare continue the way were continuing then its absolute shame on us
6898703 ive been doing this job since 1999 for the time i see a trend of moderate and above income people they cant pay their mortgage they are falling behind and they dont know what to do they are panicked
6898704 too many kids do not see a future for themselves now they have a much larger horizon and they can look to the outside world
6898705 for some families it augments their food menus for the month some of them are leaving and holding the boxes like its treasure nobody is going home disappointed
6898706 as the airlines get worse and worse corporate aviation is getting better and better
6898707 its great news for the community a majority of the houses were selling are to first time home buyers who were priced out of the market
6898708 leading to the apprehension and conviction of the person s responsible for this incident
6898709 as a matter of department of defense policy we cannot release details about an ongoing investigation or speculate on the cause of the fire
6898710 that s a real tribute to our contractors and our work force
6898711 no discernible adverse effect on human health marine life or the quality of the environment
6898712 we look forward to having more capabilities for the japanese american alliance
6898713 i was always confident that the roks could take a look at the battle and make a decision and that was confirmed in this exercise
6898714 at a crawl walk run perspective my estimate coming out of this is that we re somewhere between crawl walk right now
6898715 what we found on this exercise is that in some cases we have different databases being fed by different things and coming up with different results
6898716 the battle for information is as big a battle as going out and shooting and both sides have a vote on that as we go through
6898717 then put on top of it not only do we have one military against one enemy but an alliance with different languages and different capabilities and how do you make sure all that is synchronized
6898718 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
6898719 youve got to stop worrying about growing old worry about growing up
6898720 i have spent half my life playing horatio to your third rate hamlet

6898724 the wildlife sanctuary is such a big part of my life that there was no way i couldnt have some of the residents with me on my special day
6898725 the birds were much better behaved than some of the guests and even managed to avoid poo ing on the dress
6898726 it was wonderful to see all of the staff dressed in their finery and many had never seen me out of my gentleshaw green uniform
6898727 my late father rob smith the founder of gentleshaw would have loved the day and it was a comfort to have some of the birds which rob cared for so much present for the celebrations
6898728 during one of the several calls from home to ensure all was well during our honeymoon we were informed that the sanctuarys pair of spotted owls kylie and jason had hatched two chicks
6898729 during the spring many tawny owl chicks are bought to the centre by well meaning members of the public
6898730 more often than not these owl chicks have become curious and clambered down a tree although the parents will continue to care for the chicks people think they have abandoned them
6898731 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6898732 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6898733 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it
6898734 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6898735 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6898736 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6898737 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6898738 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6898739 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6898740 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6898741 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
6898742 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
6898743 i think probably the best way to avoid mislabelling is to work directly through a local fish monger or someone with a reputable business that is with dealing with whole fresh fish
6898744 so here you think youre are trying to make the right choice and be a green consumer and you are still eating a threatened species
6898745 once that happens in the u s i suspect canada will similarly adopt it
6898746 we first learned about dna barcoding from my dad but had no idea we were pioneering its first use in the marketplace
6898747 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6898748 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6898749 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6898750 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6898751 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6898752 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6898753 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6898754 the independent witnesses we have do not support that something inappropriate was said
6898755 people have to look at this for what it is a disturbance between two individuals
6898756 obviously these kinds of things shouldnt happen but they happen on a regular basis and it shouldnt be made more than what it is
6898757 if you ask me did these young black men instigate this situation
6898758 from viewing the video its very clear to me that something very derogatory was said to these black men as they walked past the vehicle
6898759 from what i saw on the video the witnesses i believe theyre referring to wouldnt have heard the beginning of this conversation
6898760 i dont think it would be fair to paint this as a racially motivated incident by any means
6898761 for mr trump this acquisition was not business related but as he has stated was meant to help out an american icon
6898762 if another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit mr trump sought for ed mcmahon then he is clearly pleased
6898763 anyone can fashion a similar pouch from an empty tissue box a wonton soup container a paper bag or the cardboard box that your ga ko alarm clock arrived in sure it wont look as nice as horis rendition but the functionality is the same and the cardboard box is free
6898764 reliable access to clean safe drinking water is common throughout much of fiji but there are still some remote villages where infrastructure is lacking
6898765 were currently funding projects through the fiji water foundation to ensure that these communities are provided with a safe water supply
6898766 if we didnt bottle the water the underground flow would simply run into the ocean and fewer people in fiji would benefit from access to clean safe water
6898767 rather than exploiting the environment and people as erica schuetz claims protecting the ecosystem of fiji which is our greatest resource and supporting the local economy is very important to us fiji benefits from making its water available for export

6898769 my dad opened his arms up to this guy let him in his life and then i feel like he was betrayed
6898770 my family and i are experiencing grief that is indescribable and at times unbearable every time i close my eyes the images in my head are of my dad in flames screaming hollering and running for his life while on fire in excruciating and traumatizing pain
6898771 these guys have been spending money like a bunch of fucking retards
6898772 a sophisticated and creative blog that pokes rambunctious irreverent and most of all sexy fun at the game of poker and everyone who is connected with it
6898773 youve made me so angry i wish i could reach into my screen and just pound your scummy worthless head in
6898774 if you ask me you should just go straight to wicked chops poker instead these guys are awesome
6898775 wicked chops is wickedly funny and wickedly irreverent and posts a lot of photos of wickedly attractive women if that aint poker what is
6898776 when i hit the lotto and move to a small uncharted island
6898777 everything you need could be right in front of you
6898778 whens the last time you said hello to a stranger on the street
6898779 dont talk down to me your head is moving side to side
6898780 im bringing up the past to put it all to rest
6898781 i cant escape the tears one for every broken bone
6898782 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6898783 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6898784 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6898785 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6898786 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6898787 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6898788 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6898789 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6898790 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6898791 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6898792 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6898793 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6898794 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6898795 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6898796 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
6898797 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6898798 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6898799 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6898800 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6898801 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

6898815 with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
6898816 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father in heaven
6898817 for we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon you

6898827 the basic idea is that people should not be forced to say or to do things they believe are morally wrong in particular health care professionals should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6898828 freedom of expression and action are unfit barter for admission to medical employment or training
6898829 by leaving the term abortion undefined the regulations create all sort of space for ideology and political views to insinuate themselves into medical practices emergency rooms and clinics all across the country and when that happens women will suffer
6898830 in a field where were already losing a disproportionate number of doctors this would enable them not only to stay but also maybe to recruit more doctors who are highly qualified and can provide quality care to their patients
6898831 unfashionable as it is we have to admit to loving the celebrity right for its candor combativeness and diligence throughout this years election cycle george clooney can fire off as many
6898832 depending on the circumstances breakfasts are limited to bagels rolls and croissants while proteins like eggs are prohibited what is more rules differ for events that are deemed to be widely attended something that has more than 25 diverse attendees but is not a ballgame or a concert
6898833 adding to the complexity state ethics rules also come into play if a corporation or trade association has an event where state officeholders are invited the ethics rules of each of their states must be followed
6898834 millions of unregulated dollars are being funneled to the national party conventions through so called nonpartisan host committees these committees claim to be helping denver and the twin cities but they are really just using the sizable donations for political purposes
6898835 these are all the same people who have a big lobbying presence in dc and they all have major issues before congress and the executive branch
6898836 were trying to comply with the law and still make sure people get enough to eat
6898837 they began to shoot at us they threw bombs and we started to leave i was hurt on one of my legs my back and my head
6898838 i am scared but im going to confront them if they want to kill me then they can do that as long as they leave the land to my children
6898839 not only raposa serra do sol would be at risk but all indigenous reservations in the country
6898840 several of them went to prison but they were only in for a short time since they have money and political influence with which they are able to turn these cases into interminable legal disputes
6898841 a declared war on indigenous people by groups that have economic interests on their lands
6898842 the non indians arrived and invaded our land they started to hire us on their haciendas but when an indian would ask for his wages he would get a beating and would be thrown out
6898843 we were enslaved to buy a hammock we had to work for an entire month
6898844 amazonia is in brazil but the problem is a global one of concern to anyone who defends life
6898845 it doesnt only come from agribusiness but also from public works like roads hydroelectric plants or dikes
6898846 the last agricultural frontier on which agribusiness has its sights
6898847 we will see a major modification of the landscape here of water resources and the fauna and flora as a result of the rice plantations the agrotoxics used by the landowners are polluting the rivers and hurting the aquatic fauna
6898848 all the poison all the residues from the processing of rice are dumped into the rivers
6898849 indigenous lands will not survive unless there is an ecological and economic realignment of the country and of amazonia
6898850 brazil is the only country named after an almost extinct tree
6898851 as indigenous people we are going to defend nature because that is our conception of life that cosmogonic view of the world for the future of humanity

6898853 deze trein is erg vol dat komt omdat hij te klein is dat wordt veroorzaakt door een materiaal tekort vanwege dat er te weinig materieel is
6898854 by financially punishing noncompliant states with the loss of federal funding the regulation would intrude on the authority of states to enact and enforce laws that ensure womens access to birth control
6898855 this is a giant step down a road that will potentially leave women with a major loss of access to contraceptive methods
6898856 pregnancy is not a disease to be treated by abortion and neither is fertility
6898857 to be coerced to treat it as if it were a condition that is pathological is unjust
6898858 there is an organized effort to force health care professionals to do things that violate their conscience
6898859 is not abortion or contraception but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
6898860 an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions
6898861 gwen is not seen as being any less important a moderator or having less important an assignment than any other moderator

6898892 it is profoundly disappointing to see surrogates for barack obama attacking cindy mccain particularly after obama himself claimed that families are off limits and pledged to speak out against attacks on spouses in this campaign if barack obama expects the american people to believe he is a man of his word he has a personal responsibility to condemn this ad
6898893 senator mccain has spoken out very clearly that neither spouse should be a target during this campaign

6898897 oh it isnt my eyesight its just that i turned on the light theres a switch on the wall
6898898 i dont believe in light anyway theres no evidence a switch even exists apparently carrots help you see in the dark maybe ill try that
6898899 but its right there of course you cant see it in the dark silly just find it on the wall and flick it you wouldnt believe how different it is when you can see everything this room is massive and weve been wandering aimlessly about in one corner
6898900 light here she held up quote fingers is relative i think its a concept its different for everyone there are thousands of people whove all found light only in thousands of different ways and places light doesnt do anything tangible you know

6898919 but i thought it was sort of cool to embrace the korean half of me which i love
6898920 they do folkier stuff like my music i thought blue note had a lot of integrity and so far its been really good
6898921 it did sort of surprise me when i realized what i had been writing about and why

6898924 after the film was released anneka di lorenzo aka marjorie lee thoresen a 1975 penthouse pet of the year who played messalina sued bob guccione saying that his handling of the film mainly his adding of the hardcore sex inserts had damaged her acting career by associating her with a hardcore porno film she won her case but was awarded only 4 06 in damages
6898925 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
6898926 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
6898927 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
6898928 so the mother is saying we should return home with the breadwinner of the family to mexico and the children are saying i dont want to leave im a u s citizen i dont know that country
6898929 i dont think so i think there have been enough boobs in the white house

6898932 some things you do because they just feel good some things you do because they are difficult as jennifer says a lot were using a toothbrush to clean the archeological dig
6898933 there was an agreement in 2005 in which we both made certain commitments we have delivered on all of ours now the americans have to deliver the nsg
6898934 work with friends and allies to adjust international regimes to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation and trade with india
6898935 participating governments exchanged views in a constructive manner and agreed to meet again in the near future to continue their deliberations
6898936 i think the whole thing will be reformulated but in a positive way
6898937 there was a reference in the earlier u s draft to the desirability of india eventually accepting the npt and its safeguards that was more positive than what we have now
6898938 so i think america will have to come back to us with a new draft before any decision is possible
6898939 remain something the group continues to work through in a serious manner
6898940 india is not a member of the nsg so any such statement of principle by us would clearly not be binding on them
6898941 i think this is one issue the nsg is likely to back away from if the u s comes back in september and says india will simply not agree to this
6898942 what needs to be looked at is how to deal with the new situation which would be created were india to test again
6898943 we have been discussing this for years even before the india issue came along so some countries have suggested our india decision postpone a waiver on enr pending a final revision of the nsgs guidelines on this
6898944 some countries are suggesting having some kind of monitoring mechanism to assess the extent to which india is abiding by its non proliferation commitments
6898945 i think it also needs to be emphasised that none of the countries which raised these objections were saying no we should not be doing this for india
6898946 but they want some acknowledgment of the importance of their own commitment to the npt and non proliferation principles in general
6898947 we know there are some demands which would effectively scuttle this deal as far as india is concerned but i dont think that is where anyone wants this process to end up
6898948 a vida como a espera no ponto de nibus as oportunidades s o os pr prios nibus nem precisa bobear p rodar mas s ter aten o paci ncia perseveran a que daqui h pouco surge a pr xima oportunidade

6898953 the job i wanted was here so that was number one
6898954 and it was also nice to come back to people i knew and i still had contacts here
6898955 we only produce about 3 000 teachers statewide in north carolina and yet we hire 12 000 so we have a real shortfall
6898956 we spend a lot of time recruiting in states like pennsylvania new york all over the midwest that overproduce teachers
6898957 i know that sometimes teachers want to feel like they have to do everything on their own but theres a lot of support from wake county and specifically my school
6898958 i can ask any questions from any of my grade level team members
6898959 theyve probably ridden 30 hours this week on these atvs learning proper riding techniques

6898964 were just asking some simple questions so kids know what bullying is and what makes it up
6898965 i dont know that the kids that youd get real good feedback from kids in sixth grade
6898966 on the other hand maybe you will simply because sixth graders are still young enough to answer honestly

6898978 if russias invasion of georgia ushers in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west washington fears that a newly emboldened but estranged moscow could use its influence money energy resources united nations security council veto and yes its arms industry to undermine american interests around the world
6898979 the damage has already been done it is vast and it is irreversible at least for a long time to come the vast and irreversible effects of the invasion of georgia will be felt everywhere in the ex soviet bloc
6898980 if any strategic decision of the 1990s has stood the test of time it is the decision to enlarge nato to central and eastern europe those suggesting that this decision is the cause of the current crisis with russia are turning history on its head had we not enlarged nato the us today would be worse off strategically with more problems and fewer allies

6899033 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house

6899035 we want to tell the new skycity ceo nigel morrision not to be a rat and treat his staff decently

6899040 however ticket sales cover only 40 percent of the costs of presenting opera we must raise the remaining money through gifts corporate sponsors and foundation and government grants fundraising this year has been very difficult due to the state of the economy and we are making this special spring appeal to end our fiscal year in the black
6899041 its family that takes me back i learned that here in el paso theres no other place that personifies family more than el paso
6899042 there was definitely a lot of interest and questions from participants that came from all over the country especially from administrators who are already heading cultural affairs departments in other cities
6899043 people are definitely excited about the direction mcad has moved in recently and they want to be a part of that
6899044 the adair margo gallery is now closed to the public
6899045 im feeling my way but i do know that it was time i knew it was time to close the gallery ive loved doing that but i needed to get smarter about how i worked
6899046 it definitely brings back a lot of wonderful memories my mind is so filled with stories and individuals is it the end of an era i dont feel its an end im really excited about a new beginning
6899047 one thing i feel very optimistic about is el paso and what is happening here we have an extraordinary group of artists on the border artists who visit here are blown away
6899048 the great thing about artists is that they leave behind these wonderful objects and pictures to look at its been extraordinary i want to someday write about it all
6899049 they originally contacted kids n co but they could not guarantee a show in spanish so officials at kids n co referred them to me
6899050 i was very honored and i believe in the talent we have in el paso

6899055 we had to present a biography of the organizers and give a description of the community they approved us but they also had some requirements for us
6899056 one of the main ones was that we had to do this at least four times a year
6899057 there are several goals with this one is the idea of the community being inspired by something people who attend will be able to see these different disciplines and take that back to their own work and be more inspired
6899058 secondly this helps re energize the presenters they have to rethink their work to put it in this very concise format so it requires a lot of introspection it helps them think about what theyre going to say
6899059 and finally there are some younger artists who have never had to do this so this gives them some practice in presenting their ideas hopefully they can get some good feedback
6899060 we want this to be very casual and very informal
6899061 we want everyone to get excited about this so many of us get stuck behind a computer at work but this is a way to refresh those creative juices we want to get everybody there and get them excited about whatever discipline theyre involved in

6899161 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters

6899163 with the exception of nigeria brazil is the country with the largest african population in the world it is therefore not only strange but also scandalous that such a country defines itself only through a eurocentric model for the final objective of the eurocentric ideology is the elimination of african descendants a type of subtle and hypocritical genocide which does not leave any traces of its crime
6899164 o brasil se constitui no maior pa s negro do mundo excluindo se somente a nig ria n o s estranho como tamb m escandaloso o fato do pa s se definir pelo padr o eurocentrista pois o objetivo final dessa ideologia a extin o do descendente africano uma esp cie sutil e hipocritica de genoc dio que n o deixa as marcas do seu crime
6899165 race and colour discrimination is one of the most important factors of unemployment and racial income and employment inequalities are a well established fact of brazilian life brazilian ruling society still adheres to the theory that racial inequalities are a function merely of class barriers yet we exist as africans and as africans we are excluded this is the indisputable fact because of our african origin we suffer endless limitations at the collective personal and spiritual levels

6899171 governments the food industry the health and education sectors and individuals need to take responsibility for australias bulging waistline
6899172 the government understands that obesity smoking and the excessive consumption of alcohol are three of the key causes of chronic disease in our community
6899173 thats why the government established the preventative health care taskforce to develop a national preventative health strategy by june 2009
6899174 fruit flies seek out rotten fruit to lay their eggs
6899175 produce stores and departments dont have any rotten fruit lying around if they can avoid it hence no fruit flies
6899176 most likely this would be related to ambient air temperature as a result of air conditioning
6899177 stores tend to have a cooler overall temperature below the optimal breeding temperature for fruit flies around 25 degrees
6899178 we tried everything to get rid of our proliferating friends including honey and fruit juice traps they finally perished in a frying pan of olive oil we accidentally left out overnight they couldnt resist the smell of saut ed smoked salmon
6899179 i frequently heat up coffee in my microwave which has a rotating platter and i find it curious that sometimes the platter rotates clockwise and other times it rotates counter clockwise
6899180 you may also notice that if you put a casserole in there that is a little too big it turns until it hits the side of the microwave and then reverses direction
6899181 it will keep switching back and forth each time it cant turn any more this allows at least some movement when full rotation is not possible every time you turn on your microwave it will turn in the opposite direction from the way it turned last time due to this safety feature

6899214 the number of public toilets taxis public transport and even late night food outlets required to support them

6899218 when doctors think patients have a higher risk of mortality depression screening is not as big a focus
6899219 making clinicians aware of it and making sure they realize it could be improved
6899220 disability impaired quality of life poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality although the evidence is controversial
6899221 there is the important question of whether screening actually improves outcomes in this case does it reduce depression
6899222 i think the risk is that because screening uses up resources these resources will be withdrawn from other activities like effectively following up on patients whom we already know are depressed i do not think that there is evidence that screening improves the outcome of depression without making substantially more resources available
6899223 wed stopped buying equipment wed stopped doing maintenance just to try to maintain staff as long as we could but even then wed reach a crucial point where we would have to freeze hiring though we needed the staff to treat increasing demands from patient populations
6899224 we had clinics stacked up backlogs in getting patients seen and big waiting lists we were criticized for being poor administrators when the real issue was the budget
6899225 should have already hired the doctors nurses and clinicians they need for fiscal 2009 because medical and nursing schools graduate their students in may and june they are out looking for jobs but va cant do that because they dont know when their budget is going to be in place so it has that impact
6899226 its sort of behind the curtain inside the black box instead they put forward a number that may or may not be based on that but also reflects other spending priorities
6899227 if we can get a budget process thats a year in advance and based on numbers we can look at
6899228 what you had were administrators down here who were more interested in managing their budget than providing quality health care
6899229 what you had were administrators down here who were more interested in managing their budget than providing quality health care
6899230 you had some of them veterans go in for a minor surgical procedure and come out dead they administrators were concerned about getting stars on their budget report card
6899231 when an administrator hears about nine people dying in one of their hospitals id be on a plane immediately saying what the hell went wrong
6899232 conformity is one of the nihilistic temptations of rebellion which dominate a large part of our intellectual history
6899233 no i think americans have learned their lesson with vietnam and wont make that mistake again
6899234 impossible every generation since world war ii is destined to do better than their parents
6899235 i agree with mencken that americans are not the brightest inhabitants on the planet but theyre at least smart enough to know when theyre being played for saps
6899236 not possible we learned our lesson from the great depression regarding the importance of strong government regulations and oversight of the real estate and financial markets
6899237 are you kidding i just read the latest issue of popular science and by the turn of the century americans will all be riding in electric cars
6899238 nah by the turn of the century even the most conservative stiffs will wake up and realize that making drugs illegal is a huge mistake
6899239 thats ridiculous no one would do that on tv even for a lot of money
6899240 no americans are becoming more sophisticated after being deceived about vietnam and will demand much more truth and authenticity from future presidents

6899274 and it was clear to me that reagan beat them all hands down none of these guys today can hold a candle to the gipper dead or alive

6899316 people love old machinery that was built well the original engineers made them functional but they were pretty to look at it was their art the old engineers that build them had an eye for beauty its something we appreciate
6899317 dick and i are the odd guys in that were coming at this from a first love of vintage steam and we combine it with the industrial art aspect
6899318 it was pretty amazing i have never experienced anything like it
6899319 everyone was dead tired but it was a lot of fun
6899320 it was worse than burning man but rebuilding it was the right thing to do it was the safe thing to do this project would not have happened without dick
6899321 ive watched some really amazing things come together with these guys
6899322 it gives an old guy new energy its just fun

6899331 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer
6899332 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
6899333 its truly taxing the resources here in san francisco but thats what its all about
6899334 each time we do this the better off all of us are
6899335 we can only learn so much in a classroom we always work together very well but its under these types of constraints and circumstances we are actually trying to simulate something as real as it can get
6899336 identify the emergency and work as one large team to protect and save lives and mitigate the hazards
6899337 they knew it was a cbrn chemical biological radioactive or nuclear event
6899338 and that it was a terrorist event they dont know what the chemical is they have to decide based on what they find and what they heard
6899339 it would be a challenge but if the community wanted it we would plan and find the resources to do it
6899340 its difficult to have the level of seriousness you would have in a real situation
6899341 they might be feeling a little frustrated and a little awkward about standing around
6899342 but we want to keep everybody safe and its sometimes difficult to simulate that
6899343 we take the sample over to our mobile laboratory and if theyre not able to determine what it is theyll take it over to lawrence livermore

6899356 he was obviously pretty excited about it but she was concerned so she followed up with the company and they said they would never do anything like that
6899357 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6899358 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6899359 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6899360 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6899361 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal

6899373 these new technologies allow us to access information of a scope previously impossible all with the click of a few mouse buttons
6899374 however there is a major difference between the immersive nature of pong and the immersive nature of morrow wind further as i noted i see the introduction of a multiplayer element as significant
6899375 the skill sets utilized in video gaming are the epitome of the new interactive paradigm which the education system needs to both recognize and embrace

6899396 improcedentes los recursos de la pgr contra la ley del aborto
6899397 al momento de la concepci n se crea un ser humano y por lo tanto interrumpir el embarazo constituye un homicidio
6899398 puedo estar de acuerdo o no con esa decisi n pero la libertad de conciencia es un derecho humano que debe ser garantizado hablar de vida humana no es hacerlo meramente de aspectos celulares y bioqu micos es hablar de personas con intenciones y sue os las mujeres en nuestro pa s tienen sue os de una vida digna de seres humanos por eso defender la vida es defender esas esperanzas
6899399 como cat lica estoy convencida de los beneficios que trae consigo el car cter laico del estado para la convivencia democr tica
6899400 es al estado y no a la iglesia al que corresponde definir los alcances y l mites de la laicidad la reforma que autoriz la interrupci n del embarazo hasta la d cimo segunda semana de gestaci n concret la separaci n y la laicidad en la ley
6899401 se contraponen a las de las mujeres que nos hemos atrevido a decir que el aborto s lo es un tema feo si se trata de uno inseguro porque la maternidad no puede seguir plante ndose como destino ni se puede soslayar que quienes hemos tenido recursos hemos podido acceder a una interrupci n del embarazo sin riesgo
6899402 se necesitan m s voces de mujeres para que no se escuchen tanto las voces masculinas sobre todo de la jerarqu a eclesi stica y de los pro vida del feto pero no de las mujeres quienes pueden morirse a qui n le importa la vida de una mujer a las dem s mujeres a las feministas y ciertamente a quienes m s nos importa la vida de una mujer es a las dem s mujeres a las feministas pero tambi n a adir a hoy a un a o de la legalizaci n de la interrupci n del embarazo hasta la doceava semana a los hombres y mujeres que queremos un pa s menos injusto menos desigual y menos hostil a las mujeres a las ni as y sobre todo a las mujeres ni os y ni as pobres
6899403 de qu procuraci n de justicia y de cu les derechos humanos nos hablan estos funcionarios p blicos intentar obligar por ley a las mujeres a tener un hijo en contra de su voluntad es un acto ruin y alevoso que violenta nuestros m s elementales derechos se han referido a la defensa jur dica del embri n aqu les decimos que dejen de preocuparse que las mujeres sabemos perfectamente que no es lo mismo un embri n que un hijo o hija nacida
6899404 esta postura es err nea porque asume que cuando un hombre tiene la fortuna de ejercer conjuntamente con una mujer la libertad sexual de la cual ambas personas son titulares por separado se apropia de la libertad reproductiva de la mujer de que se trate
6899405 esto ayuda a ilustrar que del hecho de que a veces se necesite un espermatozoide para fecundar un vulo no se puede derivar que los hombres deben tener derechos sobre la autonom a reproductiva de las mujeres si la voluntad de un hombre para convertirse en padre fuera determinante y necesaria su autorizaci n para interrumpir un embarazo no deseado por una mujer previo goce compartido de su libertad sexual entonces por congruencia tendr a que sostenerse lo contrario que los hombres pueden decidir esa interrupci n a n si las mujeres quieren ser madres como no es as se prueba que a lo m s que puede llegarse es a escuchar su opini n cuando sea conducente
6899406 he would be required to relocate his office to a location within his district
6899407 paid his 2008 property taxes earlier this year and claimed a property tax exemption for his primary residence located in idahos 2nd congressional district
6899408 those taxes arent going to be due until december of this year the bill hasnt even been sent out yet
6899409 more time should be given to guarantee that all the bidders can provide the air force with the best options possible
6899410 given the delays already caused by the air forces own flawed selection process the request for additional time to prepare a proposal based on a different aircraft is entirely reasonable and it should be granted
6899411 these planes will be in the fleet for 40 to 60 years and its more important to make the right decision
6899412 this is a 40 billion contract to design and build the backbone of our nations military might and the requirements have changed overnight
6899413 providing only 60 days for a major design overhaul not only skews the competition toward airbus but also breaks the promise of a fair competition for our military and taxpayers
6899414 we might witness volatility in the markets ahead of f amp o expiry next week even though there were small gains today owing to some buying at the lower level overall the market breadth had remained negative throughout the day

6899417 a distrust of television having mass appeal that seems to lurk beneath the surface
6899418 because it increases the drama makes the programmes more exciting because the viewers like it because the days of fobbing winners off with a three piece suite or a cuddly toy have gone
6899419 at one point i was asked what is distinctive about the way we give away cash prizes i dont know in brown envelopes swiss bank accounts shares in northern rock
6899420 an odd mixture of the surreal and of the very real not much fun
6899421 loaded when did you stop beating your wife type statement
6899422 those who work at the box office rather than the box ticking end of television see it dare i say in a more realistic light
6899423 yes television can should and does reflect society in all its diversity but what sets it apart from theatre from novels from museums and galleries heres what it reaches millions of people
6899424 we actually do not know whether the components will be delivered at singur or pantnagar
6899425 we are ready to supply any one of the locations
6899426 the vendors have made as much of a leap of faith in west bengal as we have without the vendors having come there and been willing to locate themselves adjacent to us and to be a part of our plan there may not have been a nano plant in calcutta because the components would have had to come from other parts of india
6899427 we wanted it to be a consolidated car company with its ancillary suppliers incorporated in the same location because logistic amp transport costs are a major part of the component cost of any plant we are trying to produce the car that has never been tried anywhere in world and at that kind of price
6899428 we will start supplying auto components from the last week of september
6899429 if any part of the state feels we are exploiting them first of all it is totally untrue we will exit
6899430 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of rs 1 500 crore we would not move we say no we would move at whatever the cost to protect our people i cant bring our managers and their families to west bengal if they are going to be beaten and there is going to be violence constantly
6899431 volumes will be an issue for tata motors if the company plans to move out of singur
6899432 we do not want to come to an area where we perceive that we are unwanted
6899433 i am making a very genuine statement and i dont have any ulterior motive i made a very major investment here and if we move that will be at great cost to the company and tata motors shareholders i think it will be a great cost to west bengal
6899434 tata will look for a location with tax benefits and pantnagar which has these benefits looks ideal
6899435 its difficult to determine the financial implications on the company in case there is relocation of the plant from singur as the company has not come out with the degree of transfer of movable assets
6899436 as far as the deadline for the launch of the nano is concerned the company would certainly not like to delay it further as the cost of production is increasing
6899437 the pantnagar plant manufactures the tata ace light commercial vehicle and is running at almost full capacity the nano requires certain specific parts so i wonder how overnight the parts could be made available and the capacity scaled up
6899438 its for the people of west bengal and calcutta to decide whether we are going to be unwanted residents or be peoples corporate citizens of west bengal
6899439 we leased property that was offered to us the land that was already acquired we believe and have no reason to disbelieve that it was acquired legally
6899440 if the tatas go away west bengal will not be hurt we are being blackmailed and we will not bow to blackmail

6899451 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6899452 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations

6899456 domestic demand has fallen for two successive quarters recession at home offset by small positive contributions from net exports
6899457 with gdp growth grinding to a complete halt in q2 and most forward looking indicators still pointing downwards the uk economy looks almost certain to head into a technical recession over the coming quarters although some downward revision to the provisional growth estimate of 0 2 was expected the news that the economy did not grow at all in q2 is a clear blow
6899458 we still expect gdp to contract slightly in both q3 and q4 giving a technical recession with gdp growth averaging just 1 2 or so in 2008 overall
6899459 the breakdown of growth by expenditure components made for gloomy reading household spending actually fell by 0 1 quarter on quarter despite a solid rise in retail sales while investment collapsed by 5 3 with business investment falling by a much smaller 1 9 residential investment i e housebuilding must have fallen very sharply indeed
6899460 both household spending and investment are likely to weaken much further in response to the continued downturn in the housing market
6899461 net trade made a positive contribution to growth of 0 3 but only because imports fell exports also contracted and are likely to do so further in response to the weakness of activity overseas particularly in europe

6899472 i like robinho because his style is different from what we have
6899473 we need one player who can make a difference to change our system we need a different type of player if we only use one system it will be easy for other teams to beat us
6899474 i asked frank if he was upset and he said no

6899484 these regulations are desperately needed to protect first amendment rights and implement federal law in what is becoming a jungle of coercion in healthcare
6899485 until now regulations had not been issued ensuring the implementation of numerous laws protecting conscience
6899486 the absence of regulations has resulted in confusion and a lack of awareness within the medical community regarding their conscience rights leaving healthcare personnel vulnerable to discrimination
6899487 this is about protecting the right of a physician to practice medicine according to his or her moral compass

6899489 as first year medical student trevor kitchens told us i am currently very interested in ob gyn but i am afraid of the relationship between this field and abortion

6899497 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways

6899503 but i was a first time director and it was too big of a budget
6899504 when everyone else around me was telling me to milk the music thing fincher gave me an ultimatum
6899505 its not a coincidence that cube vision works with a lot of first time directors instead of with guys set in their ways who dont want to compromise

6899672 we understand parents wanting the best education for their children but the law is the law
6899673 maybe theres been an issue with fighting or some similar problem
6899674 the parents lie so they can get their kids out of that situation
6899675 people are losing their homes but they dont want to lose their schools
6899676 when people move around more youre going to see more residency questions come up
6899677 it would upset our taxpayer base to allow families who dont pay taxes to us to enroll here
6899678 there will always be people who think they just wont get caught

6899689 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
6899690 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6899691 narrow escape with her jewish husband from the nazis and the perilous voyage to the new world of new jersey
6899692 elsa morante was not amiable she was not genial she was not sweet or always nice she was not a woman with whom one could have a casual conversation or speak about mundane things she took offense easily she made quick and final judgments she constantly tested her friends a truth teller she tended to say hurtful things she was immensely talented passionate often impossible courageous quarrelsome witty ambitious generous she loved mozart she loved children animals especially cats siamese cats she detested any sort of artifice posturing falsehood she detested misuse of power she once admitted that she detested biography the biographer she claimed always divulged what one is not
6899693 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6899694 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6899695 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6899696 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6899697 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6899698 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6899699 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6899700 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
6899701 this practice is a violation of both canadian and international law
6899702 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
6899703 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it
6899704 were realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and its a national concern
6899705 canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance isolation and the large number of logging access roads
6899706 the illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics
6899707 we have in canada an abundant supply on the one hand of natural resources including fisheries and forestry
6899708 but we have all seen that overexploitation of natural resources can have dramatic effects
6899709 its actually the joke of my office that i come in with pizza every single day from this spot
6899710 they have an oven in there and thats about it
6899711 no seating other pizza places around here generally have seating
6899712 we have to get the business from people who can spend the money but nobody has the money here

6899719 given how competitive the legal marketplace is we knew the best place to reach law students was online
6899720 this compelling web video captures the sense of adventure that attracts lawyers to become jags better than any other medium could
6899721 the navy jag is in the forefront of using web video for recruiting
6899722 we conducted an informal survey of the amlaw 200 and found less than 20 percent were using video on their career websites yet theyre all competing to reach a generation that has grown up in an electronic world where the web is their lifeline to everything and everyone
6899723 youtube is the fourth most popular web site on the internet reaching 10 percent of all the people online every day that says to me that video is a must for recruiting web pages static pictures and text just wont attract them

6899726 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year and bought his 1 million mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6899727 just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii
6899728 h e obama and his family stayed at a friends home last week in hawaii where beaches in fact are all public
6899729 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year and bought his 1 million mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6899730 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6899731 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
6899732 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
6899733 this is unacceptable some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
6899734 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
6899735 they dont think they have a homeless problem up there
6899736 for this to be sustainable ill have to find some dollars from the for profit and nonprofit sectors
6899737 i hope to continue it and ill be looking for funding from both city hall and other sources
6899738 its both morally right but if you want to be pragmatic about it if someone can come here and get access to all the services they need then its going to save the city a fortune down the road
6899739 were going into a down economy theres going to some tough calls at city hall but im the housing commissioner so im going to fight for all the programs which are successful and this is a successful one
6899740 where the money is coming from we dont know yet
6899741 at this point we need the funding for the staff to continue working on partnerships
6899742 this is meant to be a community effort government cant solve all the problems were hopefully the guiding force that helps build up these partnerships the more partners we have the more donors we have
6899743 a thing i was really surprised about what that people really wanted to talk to me just because i had a clipboard
6899744 this one guy said he was not homeless but he lived on the street
6899745 in general the homeless people weirded me out a lot less than the crazy people running the event
6899746 if we could go in and take care of these things on a day to day basis rather than having to flock here that would be better

6899756 lets go for a ride to the top of the mountain
6899757 i cant watch you destroy yourself it just hurts too much
6899758 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6899759 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6899760 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6899761 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6899762 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6899763 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6899764 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6899765 we then notified the canadian food inspection agency on aug 6 to tell them we had these positive food samples and the cfia then worked with us to collect further samples from the nursing home
6899766 it was based on the results of those early tests and as well based on communication that maple leaf foods put out to its distributors that we on august 14 asked the long term care facilities to put certain products on hold
6899767 well the protocol says up to 24 hours it can take the average is eight we did this one in five
6899768 there had been some clues from veterinary medicine as well as an outbreak in boston that listeria could be a food borne illness
6899769 but that had never been proven in humans before probably because most outbreaks occur in small clusters and you cant get enough epidemiologic information
6899770 they were using raw manure on the fields and the guy was raising sheep as well and he also had listeria in his sheep flock
6899771 and of course in the pregnancy related cases the mothers survived but they lost their child often a late term infant or sometimes an early miscarriage
6899772 unfortunately some of these outbreaks actually inform the public that there is that danger out there
6899773 we dont want to use that as a normal way of informing the public but thats the way that it sometimes happens
6899774 it basically said that instead of this being an organism of unknown etiology or unknown source that this in fact was a food borne organism like any other like campylobacter or salmonella and therefore we need to start paying attention to manufacturing issues we need to pay attention to what goes on on the abattoir floor
6899775 the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken off line one of the compromised fedora servers was a system used for signing fedora packages
6899776 we have high confidence that the intruder was not able to capture the passphrase used to secure the fedora package signing key
6899777 there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised
6899778 the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and passphrase is not stored on any of the fedora servers
6899779 was based on an abundance of caution out of respect for our users
6899780 may require affirmative steps from every fedora system owner or administrator we will widely and clearly communicate any such steps
6899781 the fedora package signing key is not connected to and is different from the one used to sign red hat enterprise linux packages
6899782 im excited to see it up and running and see how it works this winter
6899783 demand is booming right now with oil between four and five dollars a gallon and winter looming ahead of us
6899784 certainly i feel good about reducing the carbon footprint but the main reason was saving money
6899785 if it kills the e coli and makes it safe thats fine with me
6899786 it kills the bacteria makes it so theyre not able to reproduce and not able to make you sick
6899787 i thoroughly wash all of my vegetables fruits everything before i use them even though they say theyre pre washed on the package
6899788 i dont care if they put it in a chamber and irradiate it with blue ultraviolet light or whatever
6899789 i dont want to die just because i have a spinach salad
6899790 the group of militants opened fire at the surrounding troops resulting in an on the spot death of an army colonel and two soldiers
6899791 in the subsequent gunbattle five militants were killed a search operation is now on in the machil area of the north kashmir kupwara district
6899792 the only demand we make is of freedom india must grant it to us
6899793 he continues to say it would be a danger for police to intervene
6899794 theres not two lives there are three lives and that has certainly been a significant factor in this
6899795 we just want to get our belongings and our car and get out of here
6899796 will you visit me in my dreams tonight yeah you
6899797 la ventaja es que nosotros s tenemos a quien aplaudir en el pan no tienen a quien aplaudir
6899798 hacer un partido m s competitivo que conflictivo en lo interno
6899799 no es una asamblea para el conflicto es una asamblea para llegar unidos porque as nos ha ido bien con la llegada de beatriz paredes y su liderazgo democr tico
6899800 no a la balcanizaci n no a la divisi n no a la confrontaci n interna sino unos estatutos que nos permitan tambi n gobernarnos mejor hacia adentro para aspirar a gobernar hacia afuera
6899801 es que somos un partido nacional no somos varios partidos no estamos balcanizados ni nadie tiene la idea de que haya partidos regionales
6899802 hey girls we have been good friends for too long and there is something i must get off my chest i am a kleptomaniac but dont worry i have never stolen from you and i never will
6899803 well since we are having true confessions here i must get something off my chest too i am a nymphomaniac but dont worry i have not hit on your husbands they dont interest me and never will we have been friends for too long
6899804 i too must confess something i am a lesbian but do not worry i will not hit on you you are not my type we have been friends too long for me to ruin our friendship
6899805 i have a confession to make also i am an uncontrollable gossip and i have some phone calls to make
6899806 it was a part of our marketing strategy the concept was thought up at orange poland
6899807 the aim was to warm up the atmosphere around the launch of the iphone
6899808 the intrusion into the servers was quickly discovered and the servers were taken off line one of the compromised fedora servers was a system used for signing fedora packages
6899809 we have high confidence that the intruder was not able to capture the passphrase used to secure the fedora package signing key
6899810 there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised
6899811 the passphrase was not used during the time of the intrusion on the system and passphrase is not stored on any of the fedora servers

6899815 o meu av j dizia burra que faz im mulher que saiba latim e c negos da s libera nos domin
6899816 we have seen continued drops in property crime and total crime these levels still remain too high as far as were concerned and there are some disturbing increases in gang violence were putting a lot of energy and resources into focusing on that problem
6899817 it was always going to be him or john terry
6899818 it was a flip of the coin which could have gone either way at his age 29 he shouldnt be worried terry has been captaining chelsea for quite a while and you have to give that consideration
6899819 i choose my captains on seniority when gary neville got his long term injury ryan giggs took over and when ryan isnt available rio steps in in the long term rio will be our captain theres no question of that his leadership qualities have improved tremendously over the past two or three years
6899820 there are 11 days left we may get him or we may not
6899821 if we dont well have to carry on with what weve got
6899822 the opening track hes simple hes dumb hes the pilot absolutely blew my mind when i first heard it
6899823 the uncertainty this year is how much collateral damage was there really from the strike
6899824 the numbers coming back after the strike showed people want their tv
6899825 but any time you give them a chance to look elsewhere its not ideal
6899826 were not planning on putting on fewer new shows next season
6899827 the fact that viewers are flocking to the olympics is just a great sign
6899828 i think the effects of the strike are starting to wear off and were working through a lot of the kinks
6899829 i would like to think that the surprise of this year is that the networks come back stronger than ever
6899830 a ballsy move to take a show thats creatively still very good
6899831 without changing their schedule they made the most radical move of the night
6899832 if i were going to bet id say theyll probably benefit from it
6899833 has the most possible downside theres nothing there on sunday thats in growth mode
6899834 is an interesting night because there arent too many new shows on the air theres a lot of stability on the night
6899835 with the comedies on cbs sarah connor dancing with the stars and gossip girl there are a lot of different segments being served
6899836 but chuck has a great star with great appeal great guest stars and great storylines its being set up for a good season and theres no reason to believe that it cant build next year
6899837 the stories this year are just top notch and compelling
6899838 it feels like its coming out of spring training strong
6899839 the rebuilding of nbc is really predicated on continuing success on this night
6899840 its incredibly important to us if 10 p m works as i think it will we should take the night from 8 11 p m
6899841 the real wild card what everyone is going to be looking at is fringe on fox
6899842 theres no doubt in my mind it will premiere well the question is will it hold up
6899843 were hoping that its broad and that well get everyone from kids to grandparents
6899844 it wont be so much a case of winners and losers or who comes in first you can have two or three shows do well in a time period now
6899845 were lucky to have several good comedies and this seemed to be a good time and a good place to branch out
6899846 this is a night thats well programmed by all of the networks
6899847 theres an audience for each show along the way so everyone has a reason to be optimistic this looks like an old school night of programming and counterprogramming
6899848 i like our chances to win the night in total viewers
6899849 its another night where a couple of strong lineups can do well against each other
6899850 theres a new show and a show in its last season in the time slot
6899851 that gives our show a heck of a good chance
6899852 they do a great job getting attention for these shows
6899853 the real question is will any of it have legs
6899854 theres little risk of failure theyre not gonna be huge but theyre not gonna be embarrassments either
6899855 if we cant grow from where we were last year i will quit
6899856 the ex list is a weird show to put between ghost whisperer and numbers
6899857 but if it does well cbs will have a solid night
6899858 i felt as if i needed to talk to him
6899859 when you think about the level of profile hes brought to the area were on the same level now were promoting the area economy wise schools wise you name it
6899860 i had a great chat with him sat with him for about half an hour and we talked about his background i actually bought his book
6899861 i felt then that the reason i was buying it was because i have to understand him i have to understand the people of hull even before i understand the players before i understand the club i have to understand the city and the mentality of the people
6899862 but because of he situation at the time the clubs financial troubles and that i felt i had to be quite forthright in my beliefs
6899863 but it did knock my confidence i had 7 months out of work that was a real soul searching testing time the worst ive ever experienced i had 27 years of unbroken service as a player and coach then all of a sudden you find yourself out of work and wondering whether footballs turned its back on you
6899864 straightaway i saw players i could work with they were technically gifted as good as id worked with at bolton after 15 minutes i stopped the session and said what the are you lot doing bottom of this division
6899865 theyve proved me right as well the likes of andy dawson boaz myhill ryan france and ian ashbee the captain have now gone through all four divisions
6899866 it comes from oxford university a few other clubs use it as well its all to do with the amount of white blood cells
6899867 there was one player under more stress than he appeared to be from his body language he looked quite relaxed but he was actually feeling the pressure quite badly i wouldnt have found that out unless id done these blood tests
6899868 as a purist id like us to play like west brom but some days well have to be stoke
6899869 if i possibly could id like to have a team of chameleons who could adapt to any given situation
6899870 but we must target certain games everyone knows who the top clubs are going to be and that some other sides will stay in mid table as a newly promoted club weve got to make sure then that we make the bottom group as big as possible
6899871 in our own heads and the nations heads the three new boys will be in that bottom group so firstly weve got to make sure that bottom group adds up to more than three and then make it as big as possible
6899872 weve got to get our identity process right weve got to know the games we can do well in the ones we think we could do well in and the ones where well probably struggle
6899873 i think i was born for this ive always been a late developer i didnt come into football until i was 20 didnt establish myself at bolton until i was 27 28 and didnt become a manager until i was 47 id like to end up like sir bobby robson whereby you dont even consider retirement until youre 70 plus
6899874 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6899875 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6899876 i would rule nothing out if there is an opportunity to do so and the finances are right we would probably do it but if nothing happens we wouldnt be unhappy either
6899877 they are two tough games and if we take something from them we will be pleased but i wouldnt disrespect aberdeen by looking beyond the pittodrie game
6899878 i did notice that aberdeen did go a wee bit un jimmy like if i can say that and thats a compliment to jimmy i think the one thing they will definitely do is come at us tomorrow the aberdeen fans dictate that their team will attack against most opponents at pittodrie
6899879 i am not so sure that they would allow their team to sit back and defend especially against us
6899880 rangers had a massive disappointment in lithuania a couple of weeks ago but im very impressed with how they have come back after what happened
6899881 i knew it was not the right move and i really struggled in my heart of hearts i knew villa was not the club i wanted to play for
6899882 a lot of players would love to come back to celtic but i would not bring them back unless i knew they would improve the team
6899883 first of all what im going to do is just focus on the falkirk game when that is out of the way i will look at the facts of said incident not rumours but facts
6899884 i dont go in to your family and ask why you divorced your wife thats your problem
6899885 theres a real urgency in that all of the progress we have made on these new vehicles could come to a standstill if we cant get capital at reasonable rates
6899886 our auto companies are rising to the challenge of building the next generation of american cars but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future
6899887 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6899888 congress created this program and were quite hopeful they will fund the program now so they can assist us in our transformation of company to producing more advanced technology vehicles
6899889 billing conversion and transitioned seawave from our system to the internal globe wireless system
6899890 my own personal opinion was that immunity turned into impunity and that was bad for the entire industry
6899891 they are missing the point that there are rights involved here including freedom of conscience for health care providers
6899892 weve got to be able to protect the health care provider because that protects the patients
6899893 had someone in her family known sarahs life could have been saved
6899894 hodari joins an ever increasing list of abortionists who are facing criminal charges across the nation
6899895 this trend demonstrates that while abortionists believe and act as if they are above the law states are beginning to see how dangerous these clinics are and are beginning to crack down on them with the help of pro life whistleblowers
6899896 im not hungry im obviously experiencing hunger and it feels very real who is it thats experiencing this sense of hunger
6899897 hey if everythings a part of god and the ego is a part of god then the ego is alright and i dont have to bother transcending it yippee

6899903 eat less fat and saturated fat and eat more whole grains fruits and vegetables
6899904 what we didnt know in july was that these cases were part of a larger ontario outbreak that only became known the end of july
6899905 the issue with that is that this is a bacteria thats invisible
6899906 it doesnt take a lot its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6899907 i had the impression that my head was sinking in water

6899927 we expect that throughout the day two or three more coffins will arrive
6899928 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
6899929 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
6899930 did you forget were supposed to take the kids somewhere
6899931 oh uh has it has it been an hour already uh
6899932 you dont have a right to tell me what i can and cant do
6899933 we just want you guys to have a good time today
6899934 i knew from the beginning wed get it done matusz said
6899935 i knew for the last few weeks it would happen there was some movement
6899936 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6899937 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6899938 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6899939 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6899940 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6899941 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6899942 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6899943 today i am a free man i am longer a slave i am among men who are the same colour as me who consider me as a man i earn 1 000 cfa 2 1 a day and that covers my needs

6899945 i said we would both return the next day but we never went back
6899946 the situation has not changed with the arrival of democracy
6899947 for example i have an encampment and many people have come to live with us seeking refuge from war and famine
6899948 they help us with rearing the animals and general work
6899949 but this is not slavery like you would find in the koran
6899950 the bella people are free to leave their masters if they wish
6899951 if people came out to declare openly that they are slaves then of course the state would do something
6899952 slavery is taboo no one wants to talk about it
6899953 particularly at the level of the authorities they will not accept that it persists
6899954 like his parents before him iddar was born a slave a status ascribed to him at birth and grew up under the total control of a master who exacted labour from him for no remuneration
6899955 in my view iddars case is a clear case of slavery
6899956 the difficulty of constructing a case for iddar demonstrates the need for a law criminalising slavery in mali
6899957 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

6899960 it only takes one bad person to ruin an entire company
6899961 if you dont wanna run out of ideas the best thing to do is not to execute them
6899962 if your goal is to not fail then you may as well not try if you goal is to succeed then you should never stop trying
6899963 it has been very stressful since i was humiliated by the opd officers
6899964 they should do their jobs and not interfere with ours as media members these cops need to be re educated i dont think they know what the first amendment and freedom of the press means
6899965 i got billed nine months later for a fire hydrant that they didnt fix and i didnt break
6899966 i probably shouldnt bracket the other three with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what were hearing they will probably do the same
6899967 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule it as soon as possible
6899968 steven has had a problem with his groin and has gone 10 15 days without training with the team that is the reason why he didnt play from the start against standard liege
6899969 her fears are not only for herself but also the people around her
6899970 so far we havent had to do anything special to keep her blog up
6899971 we dont have a lot of wiggle room so we have got to come together and get some real meaningful plans together
6899972 the interesting thing about this is theres been an outreach from eastern oregon rural alliance to the oregon coastal zone management authority to the klamath basin folks we have surrounded urban oregon today
6899973 the political power is up and down the i 5 corridor and when they look east they see the summit of the cascades
6899974 and they just do not understand the impact of what they are doing in downtown portland on what it is going to mean in small communities
6899975 so if you want a class in art or drama or forestry you got to bring in a certified teacher and that is extremely expensive i would like the state to waive that certification requirement for small rural schools
6899976 this work represents a key step forward in producing a device to focus helium atoms
6899977 the remaining step is to combine the high reflectivity with a carefully deformed surface in order to create a focused atomic spot that is still quite a challenge
6899978 theyve been great the fans travel very well everywhere playing at fenway in every home game in that atmosphere is unbelievable i think its different than anywhere else in the big leagues just with the following boston has and deservedly so
6899979 its a history rich organization i dont think there are too many guys who play baseball who wouldnt want to experience it at some point
6899980 no slight to pittsburgh it just didnt work out now you come in here and realize youre playing for much more than yourself much more than just your statistics when youre 20 games under its very tough
6899981 what kind of helped me with the whole manny thing was that if i was an in house candidate and i had been here a little bit and played with him or seen him and all this stuff i think there would have been a bit more pressure to try to live up to that
6899982 but we crossed paths in the air so everything is just what i hear its a lot easier not knowing anything about him
6899983 and i really think he believed it hes been a good player hes run the bases hes played the outfield i think hes genuinely excited about being in a situation where every game is like i dont want to say chaos but where every game means so much he has been longing for that
6899984 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
6899985 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
6899986 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
6899987 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
6899988 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
6899989 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
6899990 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin
6899991 the opening track hes simple hes dumb hes the pilot absolutely blew my mind when i first heard it
6899992 it was a part of our marketing strategy the concept was thought up at orange poland
6899993 the aim was to warm up the atmosphere around the launch of the iphone
6899994 alright youll be playing the part of stanislaw a mid level executive whos uncomfortable that hes sunk into a life of mediocrity and complacency who seeks refuge by spending all his money on shiny gadgets and booze annnd go
6899995 no fancy equipment is required to read the data array once it is unlocked
6899996 every time you write data it might write to a different part of the disk and then change the directory table around so it forgets where the data was written before
6899997 if all the software does is write over the top of the lbas i dont think itll be as effective on an ssd as it may have missed remnants from the previous wear levelling or something like that because the software doesnt know about that
6899998 htc would not release a smartphone in this day and age that lacked bluetooth support
6899999 youll be spending 80 every other day to fill up your empty gas tank
