2930043 what really got to me was the number of families who were experiencing the anxiety and fear of having their son or daughter or husband or wife or fiance involved in the war it made me feel very proud of my son and also very proud of all the men and women in the military
2930044 last year it was very early after the situation in iraq started
2930045 but we are so we thought we will continue to do it as long as the need is there

2930052 after careful evaluation the miva board believes that blinkxs proposal significantly undervalues mivas assets including our technology brand recognition and network
2930053 we dont believe that the proposal as currently constituted is in the best interests of our shareholders the board of directors continues to evaluate all of mivas strategic options in the context of our industry and the broader business environment and remains committed to evaluating and considering offers that maximize shareholder value
2930054 challenges miva faces in the near term including risk and cost associated with the new technology platform a deteriorating cash position
2930055 we are so annoyed because we knew we had to be spot on with the wording but someone at the agency changed it we should have picked it up

2930061 i wasnt thinking of making history i was two points behind the leaders i was just trying to shoot good shots i wanted to shoot well and shoot aggressively and thats what i did
2930062 this is just a team effort we all came out here to do one thing to win the gold medal and we did that together
2930063 i think michael knows we didnt do this for him
2930064 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it
2930065 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
2930066 unbelievable jason finished that race better than we could even ask for

2930079 if you look at the players weve signed plus the quality we have across the board then i suppose thats what theyre going on
2930080 but when you are at a club like sydney its written into a players contract that you must absorb pressure
2930081 theyve had that bling tag since the first year of the competition i dont think it is appropriate but its still there regardless
2930082 its going to be a david and goliath battle all the pressure is on melbourne
2930083 we will listen to vieras demands and we expect to reach an agreement and sign the deal
2930084 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used

2930092 first of all we are losing foreign investment because of the security situation
2930093 we could have attracted on average between 2 billion a year and 3 billion a year in foreign investment both through the afghan diaspora and foreign investors but now it is less than 1 billion a year
2930094 those who pay bribes will be successful will get land will get access to electricity
2930095 those who do not know how to bribe will fall behind
2930096 i dont expect famine but i expect quite significant shortages of food unless the government purchases some significant amounts of food
2930097 donor countries must also address this more than anything else because it will destabilise the government and it will destabilise the current status quo
2930098 oh hey im gettin together with a few friends tonight you know to unwind from finals wanna come

2930103 british representatives on the ground and the media have reported that russia has extended the fighting today well beyond south ossetia attacking the georgian port of poti and the town of gori while abkhaz forces have been shelling georgian positions in the upper kodori valley i deplore this
2930104 several dozen russian bombers are in the georgian skies and have been attacking throughout the country over the past several hours
2930105 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change
2930106 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies

2930111 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2930112 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2930113 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2930114 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
2930115 these victories should taste like a defeat for both sides
2930116 the president will feel stronger and the governors will feel stronger and i foresee more confrontation
2930117 we warn the corrupt and arrogant rulers not to try to impose an illegal and racist constitutional project because that would be a dead end for them
2930118 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources
2930119 the endorsement of the governors will radicalize the tension in the country a great deal more

2930133 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2930134 just doesnt work very well in certain industries as amply demonstrated by our airline experience in my view its time to acknowledge that airlines look and are more like utilities than ordinary businesses
2930135 deeply offensive to those who cling to the belief that the markets can solve everything
2930136 that an industry with large fixed or common costs will be unsustainable as competition drives prices to levels that dont allow the common costs to be recovered
2930137 wouldnt affect the price of oil or the fragility of the economy
2930138 will take time perhaps a lot of time to fix in the meantime to adapt to those realities the industry will need just the kind of innovation and flexibility that regulation is designed to impede

2930154 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2930155 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2930156 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2930157 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2930158 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2930159 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2930160 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2930161 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true
2930162 i cannot make any sense out of that when i went to this meeting youve already asked me about uh i was not wearing a t shirt i was wearing a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up i dont know who that picture i dont know if that picture is me it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2930163 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2930164 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that

2930180 we pray that our employee parminda saini who is missing is found alive and if so we urge him to contact the police
2930181 we regret the discomfort and inconvenience caused to all those whove been affected by this
2930182 he was filling up his truck and he saw either some smoke or some type of gas and went to report that and left the area as he was leaving the area there was an explosion
2930183 you just see a ball of fire coming towards you everyone standing at the front of the building ran

2930194 the ontario competition has accelerated for the feds the whole question of what they are going to do with aecl and the acr1000 reactor
2930195 this is not just about selling a reactor in canada its critical to aecls plans to compete in the world
2930196 the feds will blame the province and the province will say we heeded the advice of outside experts
2930197 a lot of people have asked me to predict the outcome of this round of bargaining and my answer is ask the minister where her government stands on the issues and i can tell you how bargaining will resolve itself it will either be amicably or with conflict based on that answer
2930198 they want to hear from her does the government believe that elementary students and teachers deserve to have the same resource base as secondary students and teachers have enjoyed were looking for a definitive answer
2930199 the course of bargaining will be determined largely by whether the government believes that the funding discrimination against elementary students is a priority or its not
2930200 im looking to them to work with us and i certainly will continue to be open to having that dialogue
2930201 im not even going to speculate on any kind of major breakdown i really think we can get back to it and we can resolve it
2930202 i think there is a hope on the teachers side that the boards will lobby the government for more money but in light of the current economic climate in this province what the catholics have accepted as far as this template is pretty generous

2930220 even before beijing was chosen it was made very clear to the cities that were bidding for the games that these games would have to be held in august in the traditional time period
2930221 it wasnt a surprise for beijing the ioc has agreed that summer olympics will probably continue to be held in the traditional summer period
2930222 nbc would lose a very valuable sunday night if they were carrying the olympics and the nfl at the same time its the same with the other networks on sunday afternoons none of the networks would ditch their nfl commitment for the olympics
2930223 the timing really works for them in a multitude of ways

2930446 it is my view that g is actually quite a resourceful teenager by his own admission he has spent the last 1 2 months moving around amongst friends and girlfriends and sourcing his own accommodation furthermore it appears that g has attempted to adhere to his own values around personal hygiene despite these circumstances and is also looking to further his prospects by enrolling in college it is my view that this resourcefulness is a useful strength for g therefore the primary needs identified here for g relate to housing and education having examined the information available i see sic or have not been made aware of any additional needs or vulnerabilities that would suggest the need for longer term accommodation being provided by social services g is 17 years of age and not in full time education at this point in time therefore i feel that accommodation provided by southwark hpu homeless persons unit and referrals to other support agencies such as connexions will be sufficient at this time to work on addressing the social emotional and practical issues identified in this assessment
2930447 g has indicated an interest and willingness to engage with this service around these areas
2930448 our client department has fully considered your clients needs and reached the decision that section 20 is not appropriate as g has no identified need for social services support and his needs can be satisfactorily met through the provision of housing and referrals to other support agencies
2930449 our client department has fulfilled its duty to assess your client and reached the decision that he is not in need of section 20 accommodation he simply requires help with accommodation
2930450 1 it shall be the general duty of every local authority in addition to the other duties imposed on them by this part
2930451 1 every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of c the person who has been caring for him being prevented whether or not permanently and for whatever reason from providing him with suitable accommodation or care
2930452 1 if the local housing authority have reason to believe that an applicant may be homeless eligible for assistance and have a priority need they shall secure that accommodation is available for his occupation pending a decision as to the duty if any owed to him under the following provisions of this part
2930453 the amendment to section 17 did not affect the duties and powers of local authorities to provide accommodation for lone children under section 20 of the children act 1989 or under a care order accordingly the power to provide accommodation under section 17 will almost always concern children needing to be accommodated with their families however there may be cases where a lone child who needs help with accommodation but does not need to be looked after might appropriately be assisted under section 17
2930454 who appears to them the local authority to require accommodation
2930455 framework for the assessment of children in need and their families
2930456 1 the amendment to section 17 did not affect the duties and powers of local authorities to provide accommodation for lone children under section 20 of the children act 1989 or under a care order accordingly the power to provide accommodation under section 17 will almost always concern children needing to be accommodated with their families however there may be cases where a lone child who needs help with accommodation but does not need to be looked after might appropriately be assisted under section 17 2 before deciding which section of the children act 1989 provides the appropriate legal basis for provision of help or support to a child in need a local authority should undertake an assessment in accordance with the statutory guidance set out in the framework for the assessment of children in need and their families published by the government in april 2000 it should then use the findings of that assessment which will include taking account of the wishes and feelings of the child as required by section 20 6 of the children act as the basis for any decision about whether he should be provided with accommodation under section 20 and therefore become looked after or whether other types of services provided under section 17 of the act are better suited to his circumstances 3 the assessment should first determine whether the child meets the criteria set out in section 20 1 those criteria are a there being no person who has parental responsibility for him b his being lost or abandoned c the person who has been caring for him being prevented whether or not permanently and for whatever reason from providing him with suitable accommodation and or care 4 for example where a child has no parent or guardian in this country perhaps because he has arrived alone seeking asylum the presumption should be that he would fall within the scope of section 20 and become looked after unless the needs assessment reveals particular factors which would suggest that an alternative response would be more appropriate while the needs assessment is being carried out he should be cared for under section 20 5 local authorities have reported cases where older asylum seeking children have refused to become looked after but where because of their immigration status the children act provides their only lawful means of support in this country in such cases the childs being without a family or responsible adult in this country would appear to trigger a duty under section 20 1 however after taking account of the childs wishes as required by section 20 6 the local authority might judge that the child is competent to look after himself in such circumstances it would not need to assume the whole responsibility for accommodating him under section 20 and thereby taking him into the looked after system in such cases section 17 may be used for support including help with accommodation without making the child a looked after child
2930457 a lone child who needs help with accommodation might appropriately be assisted under section 17
2930458 for any decision whether he should be provided with accommodation under section 20 and therefore become looked after or whether other types of services provided under section 17 of the act are better suited to his circumstances
2930459 i do not consider that the guidance is actually wrong still less unlawful
2930460 i do consider however that the guidance in the circular is confusingly rather than clearly expressed and in particular that it comes very close to being wrong in some references to the child not needing to be looked after para 1 and not thereby taking him into the looked after system para 5
2930461 attend southwark hpu with a view to obtaining accommodation through this service
2930462 we refer you to page 13 of the assessment completed by mr brims where he notes
2930463 i feel that accommodation provided by southwark hpu and referrals to other support agencies such as connexions will be sufficient at this time in addressing the social emotional and practical issues identified in this assessment
2930464 provision of services for children in need their families and others
2930465 1 it shall be the general duty of every local authority in addition to the other duties imposed on them by this part a to safeguard and promote the welfare of children within their area who are in need and b so far as is consistent with that duty to promote the upbringing of such children by their families by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those childrens needs 6 the services provided by a local authority in the exercise of functions conferred on them by this section may include providing accommodation and giving assistance in kind or in exceptional circumstances in cash 10 for the purposes of this part a child shall be taken to be in need if a he is unlikely to achieve or maintain or to have the opportunity of achieving or maintaining a reasonable standard of health or development without the provision for him of services by a local authority under this part b his health or development is likely to be significantly impaired or further impaired without the provision for him of such services or c he is disabled
2930466 1 every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of a there being no person who has parental responsibility for him b his being lost or having been abandoned or c the person who has been caring for him being prevented whether or not permanently and for whatever reason from providing him with suitable accommodation or care
2930467 general duty of local authority in relation to children looked after by them
2930468 provided with accommodation by the authority in the exercise of any functions which are social services functions apart from functions under sections 17
2930469 a there being no person who has parental responsibility for him
2930470 whose welfare the authority consider is likely to be prejudiced if they do not provide him with accommodation
2930471 if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the childs welfare
2930472 a ascertain the childs wishes and feelings regarding the provision of accommodation and b give due consideration having regard to his age and understanding to such wishes and feelings of the child as they have been willing to ascertain
2930473 on the other hand as will be obvious from what has gone before i have reservations about the narrow approach of stanley burnton j in the sutton case r s v sutton london borough council 2007 ewhc 1196 admin 2007 2 flr 849 2007 ewca civ 790 10 cclr 615 to the significance of the childs wishes under section 20 6 on which the court of appeal declined to express a concluded view it seems to me that there may well be cases in which there is a choice between section 17 and section 20 where the wishes of the child at least of an older child who is fully informed of the consequences of the choices before her may determine the matter it is most unlikely that section 20 was intended to operate compulsorily against a child who is competent to decide for herself the whole object of the 1989 act was to draw a clear distinction between voluntary and compulsory powers and to require that compulsion could only be used after due process of law
2930474 a person with whom dependent children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside
2930475 children aged 16 or 17 3 1 a person other than a person to whom paragraph 2 below applies aged sixteen or seventeen who is not a relevant child for the purposes of section 23a of the children act 1989 2 this paragraph applies to a person to whom a local authority owe a duty to provide accommodation under section 20 of that act provision of accommodation for children in need
2930476 the amendment to section 17 did not affect the duties and powers of local authorities to provide accommodation for lone children under section 20 of the children act 1989 or under a care order accordingly the power to provide accommodation under section 17 will almost always concern children needing to be accommodated with their families however there may be cases where a lone child who needs help with accommodation but does not need to be looked after might appropriately be assisted under section 17
2930477 for example where a child has no parent or guardian in this country perhaps because he has arrived alone seeking asylum the presumption should be that he would fall within the scope of section 20 and become looked after unless the needs assessment reveals particular factors which would suggest an alternative response would be more appropriate while the needs assessment is being carried out he should be cared for under section 20 local authorities have reported cases where older asylum seeking children have refused to become looked after but where because of their immigration status the children act provides their only lawful means of support in this country in such cases the childs being without a family or responsible adult in this country would appear to trigger a duty under section 20 1 however after taking account of the childs wishes as required by section 20 6 the local authority might judge that the child is competent to look after himself in such circumstances it would not need to assume the whole responsibility for accommodating him under section 20 and thereby taking him into the looked after system in such cases section 17 may be used for support including help with accommodation without making the child a looked after child
2930478 the duty under section 20 1 is not expressed to be subject to subsection 6 but subsection 6 operates as a prior step before providing accommodation not before the duty under subsection 1 to do so arises in my view subsection 6 is obviously and primarily directed to the form and manner in which accommodation is provided and has a tie in with the wide discretion under section 23 2 so it is at least primarily directed to such issues as whether the child is accommodated with a family or other suitable person or in an appropriate childrens home or within the very wide discretion under section 23 2 f in bed and breakfast accommodation or a flat alone or sharing etc but i accept that subsection 6 is wide enough also to include the childs wishes and feelings as to whether he wishes to be provided with accommodation at all if he says he does not then the local authority may conclude that in fact he does not require accommodation at all and in any event cannot force him into accommodation if he does not want it
2930479 in that case the claimant was staying in accommodation provided through the housing department southwark is of the view that the circumstances in the islington case are analogous to your clients the childrens services have identified a means for your client to secure his own accommodation through its housing department and provided assistance for that to occur
2930480 2 the challenge raises an important question of approach suppose a 16 or 17 year old appears at the town hall seeking accommodation whose responsibility is he housing or social services southwark says housing issues are dealt with by housing 11 for 16 or 17 year old who first presents to local authorities at the age of 16 or 17 the first port of call is housing housing will then ask themselves the usual serial questions of whether the applicant is eligible homeless in priority need and not intentionally homeless 12 in this case the claimant may be in priority need because he is aged 17 and therefore falls within the priority need groups the authority is complying with its statutory duty under that act 13 social services will become involved in the event that the applicant does not qualify for accommodation under the above test 14 whilst it is the case that section 20 children act 1989 carries with it a range of responsibilities what is provided in terms of accommodation is less extensive under part 7 one may be in a position in due course to be allocated council accommodation and later still to obtain a right to buy 15 southwarks first point therefore is that one goes to the homeless persons unit hpu and to the homelessness legislation on homeless matters the claimants accommodation is being provided by southwark under the housing legislation 16 the second point is that where housing is providing accommodation a local authority could reasonably conclude that the applicant does not require accommodation thus at the moment while interim accommodation is being provided the authority is entitled to find that he is not in need of accommodation moreover the claimants case then has to be that housing ought not to be complying with its statutory duty it should cease doing so and social services should provide a service under section 20 instead 17 seen in that context southwark is entitled to ask itself what it is that the claimant needs does he need accommodation or does he merely require help which will enable him to obtain his own accommodation 19 in the case where the claimant may be entitled to part 7 accommodation however the authority can and should ask itself whether what the applicant really needs is accommodation or merely help in securing his own accommodation this may take the form of making an appointment for him at the hpu or helping him fill in the relevant documentation in such a case the conclusion that what the applicant needs is help in obtaining his own accommodation through part 7 of the housing act 1996 will be both common and sound
2930481 the council maintains that it acted legally it was entitled to take the view that g requires help with accommodation under the priority need provisions of s 17 of the act and part vii of the housing act 1996 and that he was not in need of s 20 accommodation
2930482 that the relevant issue was whether g required accommodation and that there could only be one answer to that question
2930483 we are prepared to accept that in some circumstances a private fostering arrangement might become available in such a way as to permit a local authority which is on the verge of having to provide accommodation for a child to side step that duty by helping to make a private fostering arrangement however it will be a question of fact as to whether that happens in any particular case
2930484 there is clearly a factual spectrum between undoubted provision of accommodation at one end to mere or incidental help with accommodation at the other at the first end of the spectrum a social services department may actually house a person rent free in accommodation which they actually own at the other end of the spectrum they may merely provide practical assistance by introducing a person to a private landlord and perhaps help with completing the necessary documents the facts of the southwark lbc v d case fell within that spectrum but did not involve the local authority providing accommodation on a continuing basis in my view the facts of the islington case fall towards the other end of the spectrum and on the other side of the line
2930485 53 it is not in issue in the wandsworth case unlike the islington case when i come to it that the local authority did provide accommodation to the claimant the whole issue is as i said at the very outset whether the local authority can determine or specify that they did so in exercise of the power under section 17 when on the facts of the case they were also under a duty to so under section 20 1 in my view they cannot 54 i agree with mr sheldon that before a local authority are under a duty under section 20 1 a number of judgments have to be made as identified by mr sheldon those judgments are in the first instance for the local authority themselves to make although in the event of challenge they might fall to be made by a court however in making the judgments the local authority must act rationally and cannot distort their judgments so as to squeeze out the operation of section 20 1 57 in my view the approach of the majority of the house of lords in g v barnet in the various passages which i have already quoted does require and have the effect that if a local authority do provide accommodation for a child in need and if on the facts a duty to do so did arise under section 20 then the local authority must be regarded as providing that accommodation under section 20 and not under section 17 this seems to me necessarily to follow from lord hope saying at paragraph 85 that section 17 contains a general duty owed to all children who are in need within their area and not to each child individually and from his agreement at paragraph 91 with auld ljs distinction between duties which are general and duties which are particular and governed by individual circumstances 58 as in the case of r v bexley lbc ex parte b a local authority cannot finesse away their specific or particular duty by claiming merely to act under a general one still less in my view can a local authority when they are under a duty finesse the duty away by claiming merely to exercise a power
2930486 64 the effect of these passages is that in certain circumstances the local authority may consider that what the child requires is not accommodation which would give rise to the duty under section 20 1 but help with accommodation which would not if they then provide no more than help eg some limited funding then neither a duty under section 20 1 nor the statutory consequence of the child becoming a looked after child under section 22 1 arise i do consider however that the guidance in the circular is confusingly rather than clearly expressed and in particular that it comes very close to being wrong in some references to the child not needing to be looked after and not thereby taking him into the looked after system a local authority should decide whether the child requires to be provided with accommodation or merely needs help with accommodation without regard to the implications of his being or not being a looked after child
2930487 interim duty to accommodate in case of apparent priority need
2930488 31 thus the statutory guidance given to both housing and social services departments stresses the need for joint protocols for assessing the needs of homeless 16 and 17 year olds this is needed not only to avoid a person being passed from pillar to post but also to ensure that the most appropriate agency takes responsibility for her the 2002 priority need order clearly contemplates that if the criteria in section 20 of the 1989 act are met social services rather than housing should take the long term responsibility such a young person has needs over and above the simple need for a roof over her head and these can better be met by the social services unless the problem is relatively short term she will then become an eligible child and social services accommodation will also bring with it the additional responsibilities to help and support her in the transition to independent adult living it was not intended that social services should be able to avoid those responsibilities by looking to the housing authority to accommodate the child
2930489 42 it is not necessary for the purpose of deciding this appeal to express a view on whether any or all of these cases were rightly decided for my part i am entirely sympathetic to the proposition that where a local childrens services authority provide or arrange accommodation for a child and the circumstances are such that they should have taken action under section 20 of the 1989 act they cannot side step the further obligations which result from that duty by recording or arguing that they were in fact acting under section 17 or some other legislation the label which they choose to put upon what they have done cannot be the end of the matter but in most cases that proposition was not controversial the controversy was whether the section 20 duty had arisen at all
2930490 the primary needs identified here for g relate to housing
2930491 lack of permanent housing will have a long term impact upon his educational attainment and will also impact upon other practical areas of his life
2930492 the social emotional and practical issues identified in this assessment
2930493 whose welfare the authority consider is likely to be prejudiced
2930494 if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the childs welfare
2930495 accommodation provided by southwark hpu and referrals to other support agencies such as connexions will be sufficient at this time in addressing the social emotional and practical issues identified in this assessment
2930496 g has no identified need for social services support and his needs can be satisfactorily met through provision of housing and referrals to other support agencies
2930497 g to attend southwark hpu with a view to obtaining accommodation through this service
2930498 case to be transferred to family resource team south to provide g with ongoing social work support family group conference to be explored family resource team worker to link in with prospective college and provide any support necessary for gs enrolment
2930499 the circumstances of the islington case are analogous to your clients
2930500 who appears to them the local authority to require accommodation
2930501 1 every local authority shall provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of
2930502 if the criteria in section 20 of the 1989 act are met
2930503 the circumstances are such that they the local authority should have taken action under section 20 of the 1989 act
2930504 the controversy was whether the section 20 duty had arisen at all
2930505 to a person to whom a local authority owe a duty to provide accommodation under section 20 of 1989 act
2930506 however after taking account of the childs wishes as required by section 20 6 the local authority might judge that the child is competent to look after himself in such circumstances it would not need to assume the whole responsibility for accommodating him under section 20 and thereby taking him into the looked after system in such cases section 17 may be used for support including help with accommodation without making the child a looked after child

2930541 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2930542 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2930543 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2930544 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2930545 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2930546 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2930547 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2930548 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2930595 as medicine has moved from being an empirical based science where you are looking at external systems to a more molecular based system this has resulted in a natural explosion of biomarker testing
2930596 its important if there is going to be a problem later on the earlier they can find it in drug development
2930597 they would have spent that extra money taking it all the way through clinical trials
2930598 i could very easily see a time in three to five years where our diagnostic initiatives will be the biggest part of our business
2930599 the statues were placed on top of the central platform of the ahu facing the land probably to protect the people and bring fertility to the cultivated fields through the power of mana the statue obtained this power when it was erected on top of the ahu and the eye sockets were carved through them the spirit of the ancestor entered the statue and then the moai became the riga ora or living face
2930600 we know exactly how they were carved where they were carved why they were carved and when they were carved
2930601 actually showed us how to carve a giant with the abandoned basalt rock tools and how to move it on skids and erect it
2930602 we originally from a further distance have considered the said easter island as sandy the reason for that is this that was counted as sand the withered grass hay or both scorched and burnt vegetation because its wasted appearance could give no other impression than of a singular poverty and barrenness
2930603 as concerns their vessels these are bad and frail as regards use for their canoes are put together with manifold small planks and light inner timbers which they cleverly stitched together with very fine twisted threads but as they lack the knowledge and particularly the materials for caulking and making tight the great number of seams of the canoes these are accordingly very leaky for which reason they are compelled to spend half the time in bailing
2930604 all the natives repeated often and excitedly the word miru and became impatient because they saw that we did not understand it this word is the name of the timber used by polynesians to make their canoes this was what they wanted most and they used every means to make us understand this
2930605 the stone images at first caused us to be struck with astonishment because we could not comprehend how it was possible that these people who are devoid of heavy timber for making any machines as well as strong ropes nevertheless had been able to erect such images which were fully 30 feet high and thick in proportion
2930606 the mystery of this island then is largely of an artificial nature created for specific purposes by nonscientific authors
2930607 nobody could ever have freed such gigantic lumps of lava with small primitive stone tools
2930608 a rchaeologists all over the world protested against this example t hey claimed that no finds had yet supplied proof that the islanders ever had wood at their disposal as building material
2930609 i also suspect that the same alien masters gave lessons on easter island at tiahuanaco above sacsayhuaman in the bay of pisco and elsewhere
2930610 the romanticist or adventurer must create an aura of mystery and enigma about the navel of the world in order to make his theory more attractive whatever the basic motivation may be
2930611 we listened to a lot of people saying dont touch that
2930612 but we borrowed out of it and were retired and just fine
2930613 we paid the loan back in about a year but after we were done we started looking at what we had lost by not having that money in the stock market
2930614 for us it would have been smarter to have lived in an apartment for a couple of years and just saved for a down payment
2930615 but before you tap the plan you want to make sure that youve thought it through small decisions made today can have enormous consequences
2930616 i just want to alert people to the true cost
2930617 he stays in touch with what industry needs and he knows how to work the system
2930618 the reputation of the school is very high and that is a big advantage when hiring faculty and bringing in the best students
2930619 it kinds of builds on itself just like a football program
2930620 it is closer to the practical application of things we have the opportunity to operate at the level where people can see the results sooner
2930621 you ended up looking a bit like a laboratory rat
2930622 what emotiv appears to have done is bring that laboratory environment out into the real world
2930623 in gaming people are looking for any additional sort of edge or cool technological advantage
2930624 its a short move from gaming to things like virtual worlds and from there into the mainstream computing environment
2930625 as interactions in the virtual world are becoming more complex mouse and keyboard alone could soon not be enough
2930626 nintendo has opened up the doors for other gaming leaders to create innovative gaming interfaces
2930627 being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human machine interaction
2930628 flip through a virtual photo album using thoughts rather than mouse clicks
2930629 very visual and typically brought up to date or improved in order to sell your house for more money if youre going to paint your house anyway use a low voc volatile organic compound paint use recycled glass countertops and other green features it gives the buyer a good feeling about what theyre buying
2930630 the most important things to do are not showy but well worth the money and can definitely be marketed
2930631 if ductwork is in the attic as it almost always is a radiant barrier should be added
2930632 the home is more sellable in the future with energy saving features
2930633 are inexpensive to buy and run and occupants will be comfortable with a higher thermostat setting in hot weather
2930634 getting rid of old icky carpet is a good thing to do if youre getting ready to sell your house anyway
2930635 get green rated carpet and i think that might be more pleasing to people
2930636 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
2930637 regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
2930638 the u s needs to have at least some degree of production to have security of supply
2930639 these are complex facilities and they require a lot of analysis on our part
2930640 but they also require a lot of design and preparation by the companies
2930641 if they take a look at technical protections built into this mill theyll realize virtually this thing is benign when it comes to environment
2930642 the technology has improved the safety systems we now require have greatly improved and the industry has a good record
2930643 the shutoff valves below the ocean floor all of them worked
2930644 history shows us we can drill environmentally friendly if you will
2930645 in reality theres probably more risk of an incident from a tanker going down the coast to get into the gulf or vice versa than there is putting a well in 1 000 feet of water
2930646 even if they arent spewing out of their rigs the entire process is incredibly dirty
2930647 theres no way you can tell me it wont have an impact on our coast and our coast in georgia is incredibly valuable
2930648 its not about whether its safe to drill again or not
2930649 its about whether its safe for mankind to use this product or not
2930650 all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another
2930651 we knew all the money spent on green materials was a wise investment
2930652 we wanted to show people you could still do some interesting and evocative design and still be green
2930653 inflating the currency and then having less product to buy and charging you fees to do it its hyperinflation
2930654 i wish it wasnt the kind of decision we felt we had to make
2930655 this new structure will attract more new customers benefit current customers and help differentiate delta from other carriers
2930656 are trying to stay competitive and be a little more innovative
2930657 fuel and luggage surcharges have been bad press they are trying to tweak some things to mitigate that
2930658 baby do you want me to get that for you
2930659 im going out with the guys but ive told them it has to be an early night as i have to work in the morning
2930660 oh so ill pick you up when im finished packing
2930661 yup then i can get to bed early enough that we can be refreshed in the morning
2930662 price movement in any free market is a function of an ongoing supply and demand relationship within that market
2930663 any and all influences on price are reflected in price
2930664 the origin of motion change in price is an equation where one of two competing forces buyers and sellers becomes zero at a specific price
2930665 green building isnt just bandages and a bunch of materials
2930666 they kind of pushed me to seek other certification programs
2930667 is a great place to sell this kind of product and theres a lot of intellectual capacity in our field here
2930668 we knew what we were doing was good for the environment
2930669 we could not believe how much difference it made on our utility bills having so much insulation and better windows
2930670 i can leave you here and head home or we can hit a hotel room which would you prefer
2930671 mais nous ne pouvons pas faire autrement que de suivre les usa
2930672 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2930673 this training is incredibly important for us because we want to take back georgias lost territories

2930675 historically russia has been and will continue to be a guarantor of security for peoples of the caucasus
2930676 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
2930677 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this

2930683 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived it could have been much more serious
2930684 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2930685 there hadnt been an information technology service company launched via an ipo for the past six months
2930686 investors are still a little bit wary of macroeconomic factors
2930687 considerable uncertainty concerning rackspaces future and the value of its shares
2930688 we arent convinced the firms strategy will provide it with a sustainable advantage over time versus the multitude of firms with which it competes
2930689 what is happening today is entirely different and its reflected in the nature of the companies building data centers now
2930690 the players in it are the companies that are specialists theyve done it before and they are capitalized to go ahead and do it
2930691 dans les milieux intellectuels on sen d sole parfois certains intellectuels aiment la france et la connaissent ils ne sont pas dupes des man uvres actuelles

2930698 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2930699 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2930700 i do sense an emerging unified view among our key allies
2930701 if you are in moscow and you are looking at the tools that the u s nato and the eu have what are they
2930702 nobody is going to send troops so you are going to get away with it

2930705 alicia was really excited about appearing on the show but when she found out she would have to share the spotlight with britney she wasnt too keen
2930706 she knows that everyone would be going out of their way to look after britney and it would be so chaotic nobody would look after her
2930707 why did you cross over to fight against the ammonites and did not call us to go with you we will burn your house down over you
2930708 my people and i were engaged in conflict with the ammonites who oppressed us severely but when i called you you did not deliver me from their hand when i saw that you would not deliver me i took my life in my hand and crossed over against the ammonites and the lord gave them into my hand why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me
2930709 you are fugitives from ephraim you gileadites in the heart of ephraim and manasseh
2930710 go stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life
2930711 we found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside
2930712 look the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
2930713 we currently operate 17 hotels in the austin market and based on the growth on the north end of town we feel strongly that demand to support this type of hotel and the quantity of rooms is sufficient
2930714 as long as the office space continues to be absorbed at the current rate and new buildings are filled youll continue to see demand for business related hotel stays
2930715 is a reflection of the extraordinary pressures at work in the housing and mortgage markets
2930716 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2930717 we estimate that average home prices declined by 6 percent on a national basis during the second quarter of 2008 which translates to an 8 percent total national decline since the beginning of the downturn in the second quarter of 2006
2930718 our pending notice of hearing to suspend ubs texas license will be pulled since the matter is being resolved to our satisfaction over the next few days more firms will settle
2930719 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2930720 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2930721 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2930722 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2930723 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2930724 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2930725 the texas coast will be the toughest place to build wind farms from an ecological perspective
2930726 our intention has always been to deliver the benefits of renewable energy while minimizing any impact to the environment
2930727 we were meticulous in the way we approached the development of this wind farm which we believe will be used as a model for future wind farms around the country
2930728 strictly from a psychological standpoint it tells you that there is not a lot of conviction
2930729 fund managers that are hot to buy one day turn around and sell the next
2930730 when you get that steady trickle the market builds on that
2930731 in between what takes the market down is not economic reports sometimes its straight company reports other times its spreading of rumors and fears

2930742 it is not good for the man to be alone
2930743 no matter how captivating the other characters may be our top priority is to discover what the bible reveals about god if we marginalize god or make someone else the focal point we will always miss the main message of the book always

2930746 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
2930747 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2930748 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
2930749 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2930750 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2930751 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2930752 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2930753 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2930754 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2930755 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2930756 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2930757 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2930758 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2930759 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2930760 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2930761 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2930762 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2930763 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2930764 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2930765 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2930766 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2930767 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2930768 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2930769 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2930770 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2930771 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2930772 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2930773 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2930774 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2930775 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2930776 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2930777 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2930778 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2930779 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2930780 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2930781 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

2930911 dari irbadh bin sariyah ia berkata rasulullah memimpin salat subuh kemudian ia menasehati kami dengan nasehat yang sangat indah sehingga berlinang air mata kami dan bergetar hati kami seseorang berkata ya rasulullah seakan akan ini nasehat terakhir berilah kami wasiat lalu ia bersabda aku wasiatkan kamu untuk bertakwa kepada allah dan untuk mendengar dan menaati pemimpin kamu walaupun ia budah dari habsyi siapa diantara kalian yang hidup sepeninggalku akan melihat ikhtilaf yang banyak sekali hendaklah kalian berpegang kepada sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa al rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk berpeganglah kepadanya erat erat
2930912 azan awal hari jumat diperintahkan oleh amirul mukminin utsman bin affan yang ketiga dari al khulafa al rasyidin nabi bersabda ikutilah sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa al rasyidin
2930913 tidakkah engkau lihat bahwa para sahabat sudah ijmak pada tindakan umar yang menghimpun orang untuk salat tarawih berjamaa yang dipimpin imam dengan 20 rakaat dan ucapan umar bidah yang paling baik ini semuanya itu benar dari umar dan para sahabat tidakkah kau perhatikan bahwa orang yang menganggap umar sesat karena sebab itu yakni karena membaut bidah salat tarawih jr sudah masuk dalam lingkungan kesesatan umar termasuk al khulafa al rasyidin al mahdiyyin yang kita diperintahkan untuk meneladaninya dan mengikuti petunjuknya
2930914 berpendapat tentang takhshish kitab allah dengan amal shahabi karena shahabat yang berilmu tidak akan meninggalkan amal dalam keumuman al kitab kecuali dengan dalil amalnya yang bertentangan dengan umum nya al kitab menjadi dalil tentang takhshish dan dengan begitu amalnya mendapat pahala
2930915 siapa yang menyertai rasul allah saw atau pernah melihatnya dari kalangan muslim ia termasuk shahabatnya
2930916 yang paling benar menurutku ialah bahwa shahabat adalah orang yang berjumpa dengan nabi saaw yang sambil beriman kepadanya dan meninggal dalam keadaan islam
2930917 sepakat ahlu sunnah bahwa semua sahabat udul tidak ada yang membantahnya kecuali orang orang yang menyimpang dari kelompok ahli bidah
2930918 menurut pendapat salaf dan jumhur khalaf adalah shahabat itu diterima karena allah pun menjadikannya adil bi tadilihim iyyahum dan memujinya dalam kitab nya kecuali yang benar benar jelas kefasikannya dan ia sadari untuk yang tidak jelas untuk tidak diperlukan tadil allah swt berfirman kamulah umat yang paling baik yang dikeluarkan ditengah tengah manusia kemudian al ghazali mengutip ayat ayat dan sunnah tentang keadilan sahabat sekiranya tidak ada nash dan sunnah tentang keadilan mereka keadaan mereka hijrah jihad berkorban memerangi orang tua dan keluarga demi membela dan menolong rasulullah cukuplah sebagai argumen tentang keadilan mereka mereka semua mujtahid atas apapun yang mereka lakukan yang benar mendapat pahala yang salah dimaafkan
2930919 sekalipun jumhur berpendapat bahwa sahabat semua udul tidak boleh dikenakan kepadanya al jarh wa tadil sebagaimana dikenakan pada perawi yang lainnya dan menganggapnya maksum dari segala kesalahan dan lupa ada banyak peneliti yang tidak menerima keadilan mutlak bagi semua sahabat mereka berkata seperti al muqbili yang adil itu kebanyakan bukan semuanya mungkin terjadi pada mereka apa yang mungkin terjadi pada yang lain yang memang lahir dari tabiat manusiawi apa yang terjadi pada zaman nabi saw seperti orang munafik dan para pembohong dan apa yang terjadi sesudahnya berupa perang kerusuhan fitnah permusuhan yang dampaknya terus menerus sampai zaman kita sekarang dan akan terus berlanjut sampai zaman yang akan datang

2930924 kalian meriwayatkan hadits hadits dari rasulullah yang kalian pertikaikan sesudah kalian pasti akan lebih banyak lagi pertikaian janganlah menyampaikan hadits nabi saw sedikitpun siapa saja yang bertanya kepadamu katakanlah di antara kami dan kalian ada kitabullah halalkan yang halalnya dan haramkan yang haramnya
2930925 sebelum umar meninggal ia memanggil shahabat shahabat rasulullah dari berbagai negeri abdullah bin hudzaifah abu al darda abu dzar uqbah bin amir dan berkata mengapa kalian menyebarkan hadits hadits ini di berbagai negeri mereka berkata kamu melarang kami umar berkata tidak tinggallah bersamaku demi allah kalian tidak boleh meninggalkanku selama aku hidup kami lebih tau kamilah yang menentukan untuk menerima hadits kamu para sahabat itu tidak meninggalkan umar sampai ia meninggal
2930926 sahabat dan tabiin tidak pernah menuliskan hadits mereka lebih menyukai periwayatan lisan dan menghafalkannya kecuali kita tentang zakat dan pembahasan yang sedikit ketika umar bin abdul aziz melihat banyaknya ulama yang meninggal dunia umar bin abdul aziz memerintah tahun 99h dan wafat tahun 101 h memerintahkan abu bakar bin hazm perhatikan hadits rasulullah dan sunnahnya tuliskan bagiku karena aku takut hilangnya ilmu dan perginya para ulama ia mewasiatkan untuk dituliskan apa yang ada pada umrah binti abdurrahman

2930961 the first step is to make the public sector a competent partner thats a big challenge the advice from private sector professionals involved in procurement is that the public sector invariably gets poor value for money thats because the public sector is very expensive to work with they often dont know what they want and are therefore not a competent procurement partner for private sector providers to work with this inability to define what is required imposes huge additional costs on the private sector providers all of which ultimately get factored into the price the taxpayer pays

2930975 a temperamental consciousness of material force brought hugo danner into being the frustration of my own muscles by things and the alarming superiority of machinery started the notion of a man who would be invincible i gave him a name and planned random deeds for him i let him tear down brooklyn bridge and lift a locomotive then i began to speculate about his future and it seemed to me that a human being thus equipped would be foredoomed to vulgar fame or to a life of fruitless destruction he would share the isolation of geniuses and with them would learn the inflexibility of mans slow evolution to that extent hugo became symbolic and gladiator a satire the rest was adventure and perhaps more of the book derives from the unliterary excitement of imagining such a life than from a studious juxtaposition of incidents to a theme
2930976 are we correct that all cultural values are being destroyed or are they once again changing under the press of circumstance and from their own internal dynamics while we the anthropologists disapprove of the changes or at least do not comprehend them to argue globally against cultural change is a startling position to accept all change as good is mindless and cruel the challenge as yet unmet is to conceptualize communities as a complex process of stability and change and then to factor in the changes tourism brings to this end the evaluation of tourism cannot be accomplished by measuring the impact of tourism against a static background some of what we see as destruction is construction some is the result of a lack of any other viable option and some the result of choices that could be made differently which is which is by no means an easy matter to decide but is clear that anthropologists have not yet met these problems head on
2930977 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2930978 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2930979 the only krispy kreme doughnuts store in north dakota has closed
2930980 its been weird this game is crazy were not necessarily putting up booming numbers or playing the kind of baseball were capable of playing but at the end of the day were in first place and we know its going to get better
2930981 its getting to the point where people are starting to count games and its up to us to go out and play good baseball
2930982 we need to get on a little bit of a roll its going to be a tough road trip for us
2930983 we did just enough yesterday and i think thats a good sign when youre not running on all cylinders and can still win some baseball games were playing decent baseball hopefully we can peak at the right time ive seen a lot of teams peak in the middle of the season and have nothing left at the end i dont think weve peaked yet i think we have a lot of good baseball in us
2930984 as i made my turn randy was right in front of me
2930985 i was like oh hi i felt bad i tried to grab him but i think i ended up pushing him i dont round the bag too often i felt like i was in little league
2930986 i think he could run out of daylight in an 8 day week
2930987 recently weve come away with some wins and at times we havent played good
2930988 were definitely capable of playing better and were going to
2930989 his call what the bleep am i supposed to do
2930990 two kind of i guess strong willed people that had a disagreement
2930991 i told him well go in my office and close the door he showed me up on the field and thats not done
2930992 this is not going to be a one day event
2930993 this wasnt a spring practice event theres nothing in the book of football that says youve got to make decisions based upon this starting time is it built into the mind set of football that quicker is better yeah but its nothing thats etched in stone i mean we made the decision to play two quarterbacks on a sunday 6 days before techs 40 21 win against florida state last season you make it work
2930994 i feel like im a pretty good quarterback and tyrod is a pretty good quarterback too
2930995 its hard to say one is really head and shoulders above the other the coaches say theyre not going to make a decision on either one of us until theres an obvious difference between the two
2930996 it keeps us to where we can go out there and compete every day the coaches make the call when theyre ready its their call to make well find out when theyre ready to tell us
2930997 i havent been thinking about it of course everyone wants to play but its still the coaches call
2930998 he said it was just a fluke deal and said he got it trapped under a guys foot or stepped funny and rolled over it
2930999 i feel bad for him because he worked really hard and was really going to push for a lot of playing time
2931000 theres still interest in takeo like ive been saying all along
2931001 but other than that i dont have any specifics thats where we are right now
2931002 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2931003 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2931004 ive had a tough year losing in the 200 breaststroke at the trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit
2931005 i wasnt at my sharpest i wasnt at my best i wanted to swim fast here once i gave it all i had
2931006 the fascinating thing is i didnt have a golf swing
2931007 i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough i felt tired possibly i was dehydrated whether that was causing it or not at least it was something tangible i could pin it on it gave me the belief that i could get it right and come back
2931008 i knew if i could just hang in there id get my opportunities
2931009 there was no backing off im a great believer in making what happens your own responsibility some days its not going to go your way you have to be prepared to handle that too
2931010 if youre going to finish second i guess qualifying is a victory in itself
2931011 i feel like i can help i think itll be good fun
2931012 i felt like i gave it my best harrington obviously played a very good back nine things just happened to go his way i dont regret anything i did out there
2931013 ive said before some guys get a little bit fortunate either because theyre playing well or someone comes back to them unfortunately it hasnt happened to me thats the way it is sometimes
2931014 i played nicely on a tough sunday at a major im pretty happy about that i just finished a little bit short ill go back home with my head held high and keep working on it it doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2931015 ive probably been the leading player in europe for 6 years
2931016 and i probably still get asked am i the leading player in europe so this is a good situation to be in its a big step to move up and start competing on a different level
2931017 ive still got phil mickelson who tied for seventh seven strokes back and tiger ahead of me in the world rankings i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i do believe i can improve its a long way to catch tiger but im putting a lot more things together im making things happen thats the only thing i can ask of myself
2931018 his last 50 meters were just unbelievable said a relieved phelps who howled for a good minute after lezaks incredible finish gave phelps his second gold medal in as many days
2931019 the poor guy is swimming his mind out and theyre saying ok one down seven to go
2931020 you dont know how hard it is to get on the blocks and do what hes doing
2931021 and like tiger hes forcing all of us to swim better
2931022 as prepared as i can be at this moment and
2931023 im not downplaying this race by any means he said after breaking his own world record in what may be his final 400 individual medley sunday
2931024 but i have to put that race behind me i have to just win or lose act as if it never happened i have so many races left so many tough races
2931025 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2931026 but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2931027 yeah he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2931028 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with andrews
2931029 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2931030 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2931031 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2931032 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2931033 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2931034 maybe thats why it hurt so much iit just felt so close
2931035 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2931036 no one has ever been in a game like this
2931037 we were excited the fans were excited bush was excited
2931038 it was amazing i had five dunks in one game
2931039 that was because of the crowd the last time i had five dunks in one game was in high school i was 17
2931040 i wasnt surprised theyre really huge nba fans here they wanted to see an entertaining game
2931041 were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2931042 i was kind of gauging him on how he felt rick was communicating with him during the practice we actually got more out of him than what i anticipated
2931043 hell pick it up and be fine but itll be a learning process
2931044 you cant get a feel for each other until you get in a game where you have to communicate you do develop some chemistry in practice but the reality is youve got to play together in a game
2931045 it makes it even more important that we get the film study in before the first regular season game
2931046 when youre out there and youre doing it at practice you get in a rhythm the quarterback and receivers always talk about developing timing
2931047 its the same when youre out there with a defensive back youve been playing with when i come over in coverage you dont even have to say anything you know what each others going to do but when youre not able to do it together youve got to get it in the film room because youre kind of forced to start slow
2931048 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2931049 never offered never considered no one even thought about it no one even mentioned it
2931050 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2931051 i talked to my wife for an hour yesterday because they had not left the states yet to come here
2931052 we talked about whether they should come or not shes a lot stronger than i am so she got on the plane anyway with the kids and ill be happy to have them here because you just have to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2931053 those are just the olympic rules youve got to beat everybody at the olympics regardless if youre seeded one two or whatever you are youve got to beat the best teams thats what we plan to do regardless of seed
2931054 im going to give it one more day then try to be ready to go about every single day in september
2931055 im not real worried about it at the same time i dont want to keep on plowing through something and make it worse i just need to give it a couple days to get some inflammation out of there
2931056 thats where he could have gotten soreness and hes just now working out of it
2931057 i cant honestly say the all star game is what did it
2931058 i felt kind of funky before that but when i was pitching in a lot of games straight it felt better then it started feeling bad again when i took a couple days off
2931059 looking back there was no real time to say i should nip it in the bud now it just happened to be in the last couple days it became a little aggravated its just a simple case of bicep tendinitis theres no cause for alarm
2931060 i would obviously like to have earned a spot on the team by finishing in the top eight in the ryder cup standings
2931061 but i still have two events to prove im good enough to be there azingers in a very difficult position there are a lot of players he could take whatever his decisions im sure hell make the right ones
2931062 i just had a bad day i didnt play very well im human i played pretty well the first 2 days my putter kind of left me today ive been playing well for the last 3 weeks i dont think one day should make or break you its disappointing but everyone has bad days this was just a bad time to do it
2931063 and especially to do this in a win is kind of the icing on the cake im very honored
2931064 but it would be great i guess its somewhat of a goal i can aim for but its a goal thats far off
2931065 anytime im put in that situation i want to do what i can to help the team whether it be a hit move a guy over sacrifice fly walk it doesnt always have to be a hit if it ends up being a hit so be it
2931066 you can turn numbers into whatever you want to make them
2931067 to me thats my responsibility to pitch and be successful but i wouldnt be in that situation if i didnt have a good defense behind me
2931068 there comes a time when youve got to do what you think is right
2931069 thats kind of how i manage and run my team
2931070 i will handle things and i do handle things i think its up to a manager not to accept someone showing them up i can understand someone getting upset but at the same time whoever is in charge has to make sure hes in charge
2931071 we are still open for business we have tightened up our lending criteria in the leisure area and it will depend on individual circumstances we have to look at the prospects of all businesses and unfortunately this is a sector that has experienced some difficulties
2931072 through the create your space campaign beam is making teachers the most accessible and relevant scotch whisky to men aged 30 by appealing to their need for some manspace a place where they can escape the pressures of the modern world find inspiration and allow them to become an authority on subjects of their choice
2931073 by offering them a chance to win a classic car and an expert mate to help them look after it we are enabling men to find inspiration in an accessible and immediate way whether out on the open road or simply tinkering in their garage

2931084 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin i have said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
2931085 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2931086 we worked hard to get to the olympics and we have come here with high hopes and expectations
2931087 the biggest difficulty is the preliminary rounds to be selected for the korean team for the olympics
2931088 this is a result of their efforts in recent years
2931089 even if we are ranked number one to three in the ranking rounds doesnt mean we will win a gold medal
2931090 we worked hard for the team competition and we are going to do the same for the individual one we are going to work hard and hope for good results we will see what happens but are taking absolutely nothing for granted
2931091 the athlete has withdrawn because of sickness he confirmed this in writing to his federation
2931092 we have also spoken to the iranian national olympic committee
2931093 he will face the impeachment motion with a democratic spirit
2931094 i was not thinking too much i just tried to shoot well
2931095 i didnt know what was going on my mind went blank i couldnt get focused during the final as i did in qualification
2931096 he performed very well he should be happy he medalled
2931097 we have held four rounds of negotiations with the thais and they just dont respect any agreement
2931098 they have not built a barricade at the temple that has been there for a long time but they are making it bigger
2931099 we await the orders of prime minister hun sen and he has ordered peaceful negotiation
2931100 i undertook the job without requesting it and i immediately asked those responsible at the greek company to reduce the commission payable from the figure of 8 5 percent which had been agreed in the contract with ote
2931101 in these matters i made sure that i did not know who received the money but even if i did know i wouldnt name them
2931102 consistent with the moderation in economic growth seen in the second quarter
2931103 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asian economies
2931104 wholesale trade financial services and business services are likely to remain resilient and will provide some support for overall economic growth
2931105 militants used a series of buildings along a known coalition route to launch multiple ambushes against coalition troops and then fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 non combatants hostage including several children and an infant
2931106 what we are seeing in cyprus and the rest of the mediterranean is extreme weather conditions and drought is one of them
2931107 it is not just that we do not have enough rainfall to fill up our dams and rivers for irrigation but we are also seeing a 70 per cent reduction in the replenishment of the aquifer and this has had a catastrophic affect on agriculture
2931108 there was an agreement to transport water twice a week during the entire month of august but until now we have received only one shipment of water and this is clearly not enough
2931109 the government has said that desalination projects should get under way but until now they have remained frozen on the drawing board
2931110 the situation is very bad we are at the mercy of the environment and if the drought continues for a fifth consecutive year then the effects of the lack of rainfall will be extremely severe
2931111 these festivals are our way of ensuring cross fertilization and our way of sharing our experiences with others in the field its like scientists going to a conference and meeting other scientists
2931112 and its a chance for audiences to see puppetry from around the world
2931113 puppetry is an artistic medium that for thousands and thousands of years was not for children it only recently came to be considered a childrens art form and even that is not universal
2931114 in europe its still considered an art for adults and at the festival you can see a lot of shows that are more appropriate for adults than for children in israel in order to make a living you need to cater shows to children but in many other places in the world its still for adults
2931115 i know most of my colleagues in israels shows so while i am excited to see their work im also excited to see something new
2931116 after all if you have confidence in your photographer then you will have a more successful portrait session

2931121 and i thought i wish this movie followed him out the door i thought it would be great to do one of those pot movies but with the action of a
2931122 this really demented movie thats in the but also has an enormous amount of action and violence
2931123 that im afraid i might not be able to love another one like i do him
2931124 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2931125 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2931126 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga
2931127 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2931128 i cant believe we dont win a race in 3 or 4 weeks and were in a slump
2931129 it is impossible that with experience of 22 years as a pilot i would deliberately crash the plane
2931130 i didnt have any intention to carelessly do things to harm the passengers
2931131 the bright students of silliman university asked questions and we tried to answer them with substance and with style with wit and cheer and laughter intact it is because their questions seemed to deal with lack of hope of being betrayed by their leaders of abandonment i hope we kept the spark plug of hope alive we spoke in a chapel a presentation room for business students and the great church all in one day we hope the sillimanians had a grand time the way we did too in our first campus tour
2931132 mar roxas for president 2010 blog which is at number 12 the blog definitely has momentum with the campus tour catching fire the blog is poised to be a prominent fixture in new politics for the country the young turks and the internet nation has become properly introduced
2931133 skycable showed the complete proceedings that night of july 10 and we also had coverage from two radio stations two newspapers and the sillimanian college paper as well as its website
2931134 i did not describe even half of what i saw
2931135 we are not that hopeful for tata chemicals and this stock may not really cross rs 375 380 mark because what ever said and done i think the soda ash assets which they have bought the interest burden will kill in the future because even in the last quarter results we have seen that the interest burden has taken its toll although the fertilizer space is doing decently well for them but going ahead with the soda ash prices more or less speaking out that will be sort of an issue going ahead at the same time about the fertilizer policy we are yet to figure out how it will effect on tata chemicals rather positively or negatively so its a bit difficult for me to comment on that at the moment but looking at the results which had come out we still has a price target of about rs 370 375 and from that point of view it doesnt make sense entering at this point in time
2931136 despite the introduction of specific rules of conduct among market players refiners and wholesalers and the submission of a batch of measures to the government for promoting healthy competition in the sector serious distortions and problems are still evident which are incompatible with the operation of a deregulated market
2931137 i hadnt been playing much and kind of made the final here out of nowhere
2931138 if you want to lose your money bet on sonny
2931139 i had the referee check the gloves and it wasnt the gloves and some people say it might have been the alcohol they were rubbing on listons shoulders but it wasnt that
2931140 what it was was the monsels solution the cut man joe polino used its very caustic it burns the tissues it closes the cut turns the area black its banned now
2931141 i stuck my pinkie in my fighters eye stuck it in my eye and it burned like hell thats what it was
2931142 the kid wanted to talk to the ref because he felt something bad was going on but i didnt want that so i grabbed him by the wrists and stood him up before the 10 second buzzer and i told him to run
2931143 to never get involved with a fighters personal life or his religion had a fighter once he was complaining about his wife and i said thats women he went back told her angelo sided with him and that was that he split with his wife split with me
2931144 and then i took willie pastrano to fight chick calder in scotland we look it up we go to a catholic church to pray he gets his picture taken with a catholic priest theres no way we get a decision unless ive got a gun that was protestant territory
2931145 i decided to forget that i hit the ball in the water
2931146 i enjoyed seeing the fans making the wave and applauding when i went up to the green it felt really good
2931147 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2931148 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk with him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2931149 im going to gradually feed him back in but i want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now
2931150 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back with the guys
2931151 we can always bring kimo back if we need to
2931152 i thought he played very well he was going up against a 3 4 front he had a handful of times where he was covered up when they kicked it down to the weak side this week against the panthers 4 3 scheme hell be covered up just about every snap itll be another challenge for him
2931153 he made it through this much of camp without spasms which he hasnt in the past
2931154 it usually happens sooner than this if im looking for a positive in the situation that would be the positive
2931155 thomas back spasms gives him a chance to work out there and hes pretty good at it and were going to keep bringing king dunlap the eagles seventh round pick along he played well the other night hes been working his tail off
2931156 but if i had a choice id take tackle let me rephrase that with tra out there id rather play guard but if tras not going to be out there id rather play tackle
2931157 were trying to keep winston in one spot and be productive with that spot
2931158 hes got some things he needs to work on and refine but i thought he caught the football well
2931159 i thought he showed courage against the steelers i didnt think the game was too big for him sometimes rookies get a little nervous and you dont get full production out of them but i didnt feel that way with him
2931160 when the lights went on he was ready to go well work on some of the technique things and the route running deals but he was focused in and i was happy to see that
2931161 things go easier you have more fun things flow better when youre having success im going to continue to just ride it out
2931162 are working seriously on it and we expect results but i cannot say when this will happen
2931163 i have neither knowledge that something like this is coming to the end nor that either of them is located or has an intention to surrender
2931164 belize and colombia have recognized the independence of kosovo we received the official confirmation on that from those countries
2931165 therefore the number of states that have recognized independent kosovo is increased to 45
2931166 i havent played at all the last 10 days its one of the hardest moments in my career im very very disappointed

2931170 i like how they did the players entrance and announcements with the music
2931171 oh my goodness i would definitely have to say all the fans
2931172 this fan base is incredible how much they come together and theyre just one big fan altogether not just a million fans they all come together as one big fan
2931173 obama will do nothing to systematically reverse the accumulated assaults that are particular to the african american experience and condition
2931174 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
2931175 there is no black america there is no white america
2931176 the duty to demand that obama be made accountable to black people has devolved to alternative structures and parties
2931177 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same united states government that you aspire to lead and were talking about the attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targets the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on
2931178 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
2931179 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
2931180 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out
2931181 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and i worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly
2931182 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it
2931183 when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem so on each of these issues ive spoken out i may not have spoken out the way you may have wanted me to speak out which is fine applause what im suggesting is that on each of these issues that you mention i have spoken out and ive spoken out forcefully
2931184 obama is staking out a position to the right of not only populist john edwards but clinton as well
2931185 only obama has not called for a moratorium and interest rate freeze though he has been a proponent of mortgage fraud legislation in the senate he has remained silent on further financial regulations
2931186 on this day when we are outraged over the disparities of treatment in the criminal justice system in a time when in jena we are puzzled over by how it is that a schoolyard fight gets charged with attempted murder we wonder how it is scooter libby doesnt get any jailtime and youve got young men in a fight getting charged with attempted murder
2931187 obamas language was vastly stronger than it was two weeks ago when he was asked about the case in storm lake la obama appeared visibly uncomfortable by the question and said the teens appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation
2931188 were a nation of laws so we respect the verdict that came down resorting to violence to express displeasure over a verdict is something that is completely unacceptable and is counterproductive
2931189 this tragedy has deeply saddened new yorkers and all americans my thoughts are with nicole and her children and the rest of seans family during this difficult time the court has given its verdict and now we await the conclusion of a department of justice civil rights investigation we must also embrace this opportunity to take steps in our communities in our law enforcement agencies and in our government to make sure this does not happen again
2931190 theres been much attention in the press about the fact that those who were left behind in new orleans were disproportionately poor and african american ive said publicly that i do not subscribe to the notion that the painfully slow response of fema and the department of homeland security was racially based the ineptitude was colorblind
2931191 i see no evidence of active malice but i see a continuation of passive indifference on the part of our government towards the least of these and so i hope that out of this crisis we all begin to reflect democrat and republican on not only our individual responsibilities to ourselves and our families but to our mutual responsibilities to our fellow americans i hope we realize that the people of new orleans werent just abandoned during the hurricane they were abandoned long ago to murder and mayhem in their streets to substandard schools to dilapidated housing to inadequate health care to a pervasive sense of hopelessness
2931192 obama absolved fema of what the vast majority of blacks saw as racist behavior
2931193 i was a civil rights lawyer i passed the first racial profiling legislation in illinois so these are issues i worked on for decades i passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in illinois
2931194 i believe that the only way were going to solve these problems in our country is that all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old gay straight that i think has got to be our agenda alright ok
2931195 what action he would take in the first 100 days of his presidency
2931196 our march is a march for america not black america or white america not rich america or poor america rural america or urban america but all america an america where no childs destiny is determined before shes born and no ones future is confined to the neighborhood hes born into an america where hard work is still a ticket to the middle class and you can make it if you try
2931197 beaucoup dinvestisseurs consid rent les troubles en g orgie comme une raison suppl mentaire de vendre leurs euros leurope reposant fortement sur la russie pour son approvisionnement en p trole

2931205 het was gewoon een ongelooflijk grote explosie alle ramen vlogen uit mijn huis

2931207 de reis is het doel het gaat er nu niet om dat je van a naar b vliegt maar juist hoe je de reis ervaart
2931208 we willen heel graag dat mensen over tien jaar nog weten dat ze dit hebben meegemaakt het moet uniek zijn dat is onze leidraad
2931209 deze mensen willen een mooie ervaring genieten van luxe en rust
2931210 hij is modern ruim trilt niet en is zo goed als geruisloos
2931211 in my career id like to become a strike bowler and a new ball bowler for england but you have to earn that right
2931212 im thoroughly enjoying test match cricket and hopefully a haul will come at some stage
2931213 its stood me in good stead because i think after about 10 one day internationals i only had about five wickets and at that time i was thinking about how i was going to get international wickets and after 30 ive got 40 odd now
2931214 het bivakkeren op een woonboot is een genot het voelt al als vakantie
2931215 iedereen kent elkaar iedereen helpt elkaar als er problemen zijn en er is een sterke sociale controle anderzijds laten we elkaar in alle dingen vrij
2931216 mijn ouders trokken in een woonark vanwege de woningnood op de wal ik ben erop geboren en getogen toen ik bijna dertig was heb ik zelf aan de rosandepolder een arkje gekocht dat zo ongeveer op instorten stond daarin kon ik me voorlopig redden de bouwval heb ik voor een symbolisch bedrag van 1 euro aan een vriend verkocht hij is ermee naar friesland getrokken
2931217 de hele buitenkant is gebaseerd op aluminium en dus onderhoudsvrij doordat ik het aluminiumwereldje ken kon ik aan betaalbaar materiaal komen mijn vader en mijn broer hebben geholpen bij de bouw
2931218 kan joyce zich nog een beetje met de inrichting bemoeien
2931219 als het in mei maar klaar is want dan hopen we te gaan trouwen
2931220 het biedt vrijheid en rust als ik s avonds uit mijn werk kom met een hoofd vol stress vind ik het heerlijk om zo vanuit de woonkamer met mijn rubberbootje met buitenboordmotor de rijn op te varen even gek doen of gewoon heel rustig de gedachten verzetten heerlijk is dat of ik ga bij mooi weer het water in zwembroek aan en duiken maar zo vanaf het terras
2931221 we verwachten binnenkort een aansluiting te krijgen op het rioolstelsel tot die tijd gaat het hele goedje van douche vaatwasser en toilet gewoon het oppervlaktewater in
2931222 maar zolang ik hier woon heb ik nooit iets onsmakelijks voorbij zien drijven
2931223 kan sudah kementrian terkait nggak perlu ke presiden itu lah
2931224 there is no problem for the ethnic greeks there is a family in the region that has been bombed and they are well and have been in contact with greek diplomatic authorities

2931229 wasser weicht die oberste hautschicht auf die nat rlichen fette darauf gehen verloren die haut wird rau und durchl ssig
2931230 eine falsche hautreinigung mit alkalischen seifen aggressiver handwaschpaste oder gar schrubben mit einer handb rste geben der haut den rest
2931231 das argument dass man mit handschuhen nicht pr zise genug arbeiten kann ist heute l ngst berholt
2931232 der markt bietet heute handschuhe mit hervorragender passform aus atmungsaktiven materialien f r optimale fingerfertigkeit und komfort
2931233 vor allem wer mit chemikalien arbeitet etwa mit pflanzenschutzmitteln oder d ngemitteln sollte dringend darauf achten dass er auch den richtigen und daf r geeigneten schutzhandschuh tr gt

2931236 ive been a duke fan for the past forty some years and ive been waiting for someone since steve spurrier to come in and turn around this program
2931237 i went to their spring game and i liked what i saw i just like his enthusiasm and i like the way he has the kids involved in the community
2931238 ive been a season ticket holder for 25 years and ive suffered a little
2931239 when i heard he was coming i have been his biggest cheerleader
2931240 he wants to go to a bowl game and he can do that with his enthusiasm his coaching ability just the good person he is he can do that we can do it
2931241 you could bring in uscs football coach you could bring in floridas coach it doesnt matter who you bring in nobody would be bigger than coach k
2931242 the rivalry actually has been pretty good lately because both teams have been so bad
2931243 a successful football program is not just going to be about the players
2931244 its going to be about you and i we cant do it without you guys
2931245 how many times have you been on a college campus and thought to yourself that person doesnt look college aged
2931246 a couple of years back she pleaded with her parents to let her come home to quit the sport of gymnastics well were all lucky she didnt because this is magical
2931247 it was a sip of wine and wear a wig for one crap song i hate not to be grateful but i expected dinner or costumes
2931248 so weve got two people with no hair for that
2931249 after that win i was pretty excited i lost my voice i was definitely pretty emotional
2931250 it could have stopped right then and there ive never seen anything like that before
2931251 when you put the record holder bernard on the end of your relay and you go in behind him your chances are slim and none
2931252 running down somebody who holds the world record and is on their game is incredible
2931253 after that win i was pretty excited i lost my voice i was definitely pretty emotional
2931254 citizens union believes that the names of elected officials appearing on garbage cans are an inappropriate form of political self promotion with their tax dollars the citizens of new york pay for these garbage cans not the elected officials who take credit for them
2931255 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
2931256 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
2931257 and even if they are just buddist monks religious forces are always regarded by the chinese government as one of the political threats to the regime
2931258 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
2931259 people say things will get better after the olympics but im not so sure
2931260 and the people in the houses all went to the university
2931261 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2931262 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2931263 with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2931264 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies
2931265 this is a difficult time to attain research funds particularly from the national institutes of health from which many of our scientists get support that being the case it is a true testament to our investigators that they have continued to grow our research enterprise
2931266 this is great news for our campus particularly as we anticipate the opening of our new research tower early next year the research future for unmc looks very bright
2931267 our continuing growth is an excellent result and shows the inspired effort given by unmc scientists during a time of unbelievable competition for limited research dollars
2931268 i am very pleased with their courage and optimism and very proud of the unmc corps of researchers
2931269 overall the unmc research enterprise has been able to ride out the crisis and not only maintain but grow
2931270 i believe we are about to enter an era of renewal and restoration at nih and other federal agencies
2931271 any wine that you like is a good wine doesnt matter the year or cost if it is good to you it is a good wine
2931272 we have a process that secures the documents from the time that the user disposes of them to the time that they are recycled
2931273 it is a waste of man hours and resources to shred documents on this campus
2931274 our recycling center has controlled access and that prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing the documents when they are in the center
2931275 it is a waste of man hours and resources to shred documents on this campus
2931276 aside from the time that is wasted manually putting documents into a shredder its also costly to purchase and maintain shredders its better all around if people recycle the paper in the locked bins
2931277 du er s herlig niels dig ka jeg sgu god
2931278 a large portable radio and tape player with two attached speakers
2931279 you could gift it to a deserving friend or swap items there are actually kitchen gizmo swap parties that you can host for rarely used items in good condition its also a great excuse to get your girlfriends together
2931280 when designing a kitchen we always follow the point of use rule
2931281 which is to say everything should be stored near where you will likely use it first store the spices near the cooktop knives near a prep area vertical tray storage near the ovens and so on
2931282 a few roll out trays will cost about 300 but to fully customize a kitchen with built in storage solutions you can reach anywhere from 5 000 to 10 000
2931283 an individual roll out is anywhere from 80 to 400
2931284 while spice inserts and trash can cabinets are about 350 to 400 there are many different price points based on quality finish and complexity
2931285 its a waste of space to have a foot and a half deep shelf that holds canned goods
2931286 a pantry is a multipurpose catchall sort of room but organization is possible if not essential
2931287 you could spend 2 000 to 10 000 if youre outfitting an existing pantry with a good system
2931288 a good budget range for a pantry would be 375 for basic adjustable shelves to 1 200 for corner shelves pullout spice and wine racks vertical tray slots and lots of shelving
2931289 few homes have laundry rooms equipped for efficiently completing the tasks of doing laundry from start to finish
2931290 without adequate space for sorting and folding in the laundry room those jobs end up being done in other rooms putting laundry all over the house and making the tasks less efficient
2931291 laundry rooms also commonly double as mudrooms lockers with bases for sitting and tops with shelves and hooksare popular
2931292 an office set up with little thought can be a frustrating place to work
2931293 plan an uncluttered work surface files should be under the countertop printers and other equipment in cabinets office supplies in drawers or easy to reach upper cabinets
2931294 designed everything from white laminate lockers with open shelves baskets and hooks to those made with fine wood doors
2931295 each locker had a name painted on the door and the blackboard was used to write each persons schedule for the week
2931296 when i show up at a house typically homeowners are overwhelmed most people want access from one point to another without tripping and killing themselves
2931297 what do i expect out of a custom closet system what is the difference between wall hung and floor based closet systems and what types of hanging rods are best for my closet
2931298 closets have become quasi dressing areas with subdivided drawers on high end runners and tri fold mirrors
2931299 amenities must have viable space but you can take an 8 foot reach in closet and improve its organization wire baskets are cheaper but can still handle the task
2931300 aku nunggu papa pulang sebab aku mau tanya berapa sih gaji papa

2931322 to whom do you find yourself oddly attracted men who land far from the classic definition of good looking or handsome
2931323 i could care less if some one finds me attractive or unattractive
2931324 the fact that i was also at least subconsciously finding myself somewhat favorably disposed towards people who were kind of idiots just because they had pretty hair was really disturbing when i realized it but i even being aware of it i would find myself still doing it

2931342 when the month of thai jan 14th starts all roads open up
2931343 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these middle eastern gaming policy workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
2931344 most middle eastern gaming policy companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
2931345 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
2931346 our middle eastern gaming policy company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
2931347 seven ways to increase productivity in the middle eastern gaming policy business
2931348 if you tell someone in the middle eastern gaming policy field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
2931349 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
2931350 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing middle eastern gaming policy workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
2931351 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the middle eastern gaming policy industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously
2931352 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
2931353 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company

2931380 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
2931381 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

2931389 oh dallas quite teasing and just get in the car
2931390 logan brought 8 of them to school for our science unit when we were at recess he asked if i wanted one mom you know how much i love snakes and so i told him yes so i emptied my crayon box and we stuffed it inside and i hid it in the back of my desk all day
2931391 did mrs folden know that you had the snake in your desk
2931392 no and mom youre not going to tell her are you i was so super scared all day that it would get loose and i would get in trouble
2931393 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2931394 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2931395 its very difficult for us as georgians because of everything thats going on at home it was nice that natalia paderina came up to me after and gave me a handshake
2931396 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931397 that would have to be in the unbelievable category thats the biggest word i know
2931398 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials it kind of affects your confidence a little bit
2931399 i felt good going into the race tonight obviously everybody brought their a game everybody swum really really really well its just a true testament to the job beijing has done allowing the athletes to perform at their peak its awesome thats what you want in an olympics and theyve done an amazing job as a host
2931400 it was in kind of broken english so he could understand me i just said congratulations man thats an awesome swim i know if id done that in front of him hed have done exactly the same thing youve got to tip your hat off to somebody who goes 58 9 in an olympic final its awesome
2931401 i dont want to be the center of attention now
2931402 its like a card game and a lot of people are showing their hands
2931403 i knew i wasnt at my sharpest i wasnt at my best
2931404 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931405 of course there will be pressure the only thing i can do is overcome it
2931406 i hope the pressure can become the motivation and that i can be very calm
2931407 it was not as relaxed and easy as it looks because we actually worked very hard every day training from morning until night
2931408 the last dive may not have been perfect but it was not a failure
2931409 but im sure china will come up with someone new
2931410 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931411 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931412 this is an isolated incident that had nothing to do with anything other than what can happen in any big city around the world if it had been some other random tourist we wouldnt even know anything about it maybe
2931413 so of course she got on the plane anyway and ill be happy to have them here you know youve just got to live your life you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2931414 bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas still go to wal mart thats how you kind of have to live your life
2931415 they have told us not to do anything like that
2931416 you know at the olympics it could be anything it could be because you guys want an interview it could be a problem with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know not until we got our therapy done and whatnot and saw the usoc people show up and the head of usa volleyball we knew something was wrong
2931417 we had lots of questions being only a couple hours since the incident they didnt have a lot of answers thats where most of the frustration came in were trying to make decisions in the next six hours people are supposed to fly here should we tell them to come not come was it something related to usa athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know obviously it was
2931418 we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2931419 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931420 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2931421 you have to get focused and give it a go
2931422 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2931423 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931424 just unfurling a banner in tiananmen square took every ounce of courage i had
2931425 in some parts of china 10 000 yuan or about 1 400 is the price of life
2931426 they tried to block the view and asked us why are you doing this then they tried to take our banner
2931427 we said no and they threatened to put us in jail for five days
2931428 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931429 they laid a fastball in there and he hit it out
2931430 thats what happens if youve got patience i aint worried about chases hitting not at all his hitting is going to come around hes fine hes a good hitter
2931431 obviously i didnt want to hit into a double play but we swung the bats well late in the game thats really all that matters
2931432 weve all been in the batters box hundreds of times with guys on base and without guys on base
2931433 so you try not to let it change your approach
2931434 he still gets his walks when he gets a hit its usually a huge one i think thats the sign of a great hitter to be able to mask those slumps with his tenacity even if hes 0 for 20 having him in the lineup is a weapon
2931435 hes so steady so even keel he does a good job of not riding that roller coaster that a lot of us get wrapped up in thats why as great as he is a lot of us dont notice he may be in any kind of slump
2931436 he makes it look too easy at times hes a huge part of our success this year he prepares every day hes a good guy to have on your team
2931437 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931438 no one has ever been in a game like this
2931439 we were excited the fans were excited bush was excited
2931440 it was amazing i had five dunks in one game
2931441 that was because of the crowd the last time i had five dunks in one game was in high school i was 17
2931442 i wasnt surprised theyre really huge nba fans here they wanted to see an entertaining game
2931443 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931444 hey we want a nickle for the bag you used
2931445 he went through about three quarters of the morning practice maybe a little bit more than that
2931446 we took him out because were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2931447 i dont know if it will be as much as the first group goes or if hell just take a few snaps but well see how he feels here
2931448 he needs to practice in this scheme but hell pick it up and be fine
2931449 i knew that the team wasnt going to be too happy with me not being involved in the optional workouts you can ask anyone around im the first one here and the last one to leave i love pushing myself working out and being here its just with some personal things going on i wasnt here
2931450 i know i just have to keep getting better every day and try to help this team
2931451 kimo has to get himself right and we can always bring him back if we need to later
2931452 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931453 in the video game industry if you sell a million copies you throw a ticker tape parade
2931454 if youre selling five to six million copies of the same title every year youve just won the super bowl world series and stanley cup combined
2931455 people who want to play with their favorite quarterback or their favorite team
2931456 hard core players can do hundreds of hours of labbing playing all the different teams to find an edge
2931457 theres a crazy amount of dedication to finding out ways to win this game
2931458 then its a race to figure out the game the players change but mostly its what ea does with the game the new features
2931459 mostly practice and reaction time and getting everything down so you dont have to think about it while youre playing
2931460 randy moss has a big advantage over any defensive back
2931461 just throw the ball up and hell go get it
2931462 im very competitive and i like to match wits with other opponents
2931463 i love to talk trash thats the best part of the game for me
2931464 if youre playing a good defensive back like antonio cromartie why would the ball go through his hands and hit him in the face
2931465 ea does it because they dont want the backs to have outrageous interception stats but its really annoying
2931466 it should balance out between someone with twitch skills and someone who knows football strategy
2931467 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931468 the last time i had five dunks i was like 17 thats all because of the energy
2931469 the one thing about us were not used to seeing open looks
2931470 what did you do to have your players kill their super egos
2931471 well im going to tell them you think they have super egos
2931472 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931473 ive had a tough year losing in the 200 breaststroke at the trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit
2931474 i wasnt at my sharpest i wasnt at my best i wanted to swim fast here once i gave it all i had
2931475 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931476 its the perfect time to make mistakes to get the nerves out we have our world title from last year and we feel like we are the world champions and we want to show the world that
2931477 i am totally surprised its some type of nerves i just have no explanation
2931478 both of us have hoped and prayed that when this day came we would be one and two
2931479 whether it was her first or me first it didnt matter going into the all around final its going to be great knowing that no matter what ill have my teammate right there and shell be helping me and ill be helping her
2931480 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931481 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
2931482 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931483 hmmm i wonder what could have pulled jeremy away from his beer and l amp o
2931484 jaimerais me fondre dans cette for t je r ve daller toucher ce grand fr ne qui soutient le ciel oui mais aussi le temps
2931485 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2931486 his last 50 meters were just unbelievable said a relieved phelps who howled for a good minute after lezaks incredible finish gave phelps his second gold medal in as many days
2931487 the poor guy is swimming his mind out and theyre saying ok one down seven to go
2931488 you dont know how hard it is to get on the blocks and do what hes doing
2931489 and like tiger hes forcing all of us to swim better
2931490 as prepared as i can be at this moment and
2931491 im not downplaying this race by any means he said after breaking his own world record in what may be his final 400 individual medley sunday
2931492 but i have to put that race behind me i have to just win or lose act as if it never happened i have so many races left so many tough races
2931493 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931494 good evening ive come to see if youve a room for just one night i came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore and theres no bus till morning
2931495 i guess its my face i know it looks terrible but my doctor says with a few more treatments
2931496 i could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch my bus leaves early in the morning
2931497 your children made me feel at home grownups are bothered by my face but children dont seem to mind
2931498 did you keep that awful looking man last night i turned him away you can lose roomers by putting up such people
2931499 if this were my plant id put it in the loveliest container i had
2931500 i will issue rebate checks to help you with the price of gasoline
2931501 i am president there will be no more excuses they will have to make cars that use less oil
2931502 you people have brought so much advancement to the country sir
2931503 you sit in an office and write something on a computer and it does so many big things outside
2931504 it is not as simple as that my friend it is not just a question of writing a few lines there is a lot of process that goes behind it
2931505 it has to be no wonder you people are so highly paid
2931506 everyone just sees the money no one sees the amount of hard work we have to put in
2931507 indians have such a narrow concept of hard work just because we sit in an air conditioned office doesnt mean our brows dont sweat you exercise the muscle we exercise the mind and believe me that is no less taxing
2931508 let me give you an example take this train the entire railway reservation system is computerized you can book a train ticket between any two stations from any of the hundreds of computerized booking centers across the country thousands of transactions accessing a single database at a given time concurrency data integrity locking data security do you understand the complexity in designing and coding such a system
2931509 oh come on does life ever get easy as you go up the ladder responsibility only brings more work design and coding that is the easier part now i dont do it but i am responsible for it and believe me that is far more stressful my job is to get the work done in time and with the highest quality and to tell you about the pressures there is the customer at one end always changing his requirements the user wanting something else and your boss always expecting you to have finished it yesterday
2931510 you dont know what it is to be in the line of fire
2931511 i know sir i know what it is to be in the line of fire
2931512 there were 30 of us when we were ordered to capture point 4875 in the cover of the night the enemy was firing from the top there was no knowing where the next bullet was going to come from and for whom in the morning when we finally hoisted the tricolor at the top only 4 of us were alive
2931513 i am subedar sushant from the 13 j amp k rifles on duty at peak 4875 in kargil they tell me i have completed my term and can opt for a land assignment but tell me sir can one give up duty just because it makes life easier on the dawn of that capture one of my colleagues lay injured in the snow open to enemy fire while we were hiding behind a bunker it was my job to go and fetch that soldier to safety but my captain refused me permission and went ahead himself he said that the first pledge he had taken as a gentleman cadet was to put the safety and welfare of the nation foremost followed by the safety and welfare of the men he commanded his own personal safety came last always and every time he was killed as he shielded that soldier into the bunker every morning now as i stand guard i can see him taking all those bullets which were actually meant for me i know sir i know what it is to be in the line of fire
2931514 if you ask for a statement he types it from his books and you get the printout if you ask for a withdrawal he checks the balance and any restrictions and if all is okay he gives you the amount he then calls all of the other branches and atms tells them how much youve withdrawn so that they can update their books
2931515 the fascinating thing is i didnt have a golf swing
2931516 i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough i felt tired possibly i was dehydrated whether that was causing it or not at least it was something tangible i could pin it on it gave me the belief that i could get it right and come back
2931517 i knew if i could just hang in there id get my opportunities
2931518 there was no backing off im a great believer in making what happens your own responsibility some days its not going to go your way you have to be prepared to handle that too
2931519 if youre going to finish second i guess qualifying is a victory in itself
2931520 i feel like i can help i think itll be good fun
2931521 i felt like i gave it my best harrington obviously played a very good back nine things just happened to go his way i dont regret anything i did out there
2931522 ive said before some guys get a little bit fortunate either because theyre playing well or someone comes back to them unfortunately it hasnt happened to me thats the way it is sometimes
2931523 i played nicely on a tough sunday at a major im pretty happy about that i just finished a little bit short ill go back home with my head held high and keep working on it it doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2931524 ive probably been the leading player in europe for 6 years
2931525 and i probably still get asked am i the leading player in europe so this is a good situation to be in its a big step to move up and start competing on a different level
2931526 ive still got phil mickelson who tied for seventh seven strokes back and tiger ahead of me in the world rankings i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i do believe i can improve its a long way to catch tiger but im putting a lot more things together im making things happen thats the only thing i can ask of myself
2931527 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931528 if i had not seen the porn websites i would not have done such a thing
2931529 the boom of pornographic content on the internet has contaminated cyberspace and perverted chinas young minds the inflow of pornographic materials from abroad and lax domestic control are to blame for the existing problems in chinas cyberspace
2931530 as more and more illegal and unhealthy information spreads through the blog and search engine we will take effective measures to put the bbs blog and search engine under control
2931531 strengthen positive guidance web sites should proactively guide public opinion in a positive way highlight positive voices and create a pro npc online environment
2931532 no matter how china tries to control olympic related news and imagery anyone with a cell phone will be a journalist come august
2931533 wei wenhua was driving through the area when he stopped to film the protests which were triggered by a decision to build a rubbish tip close to a residential area it was not clear whether he stopped on impulse or deliberately set out to record the clashes in which villagers faced about 50 local officials and enforcers known as chengguan but when it became clear what he was doing the chengguan turned on him he tried to flee but was beaten for 10 minutes witnesses said among those being questioned by police is a senior government official the state news agency xinhua said
2931534 the coming of an era for the second land reform
2931535 in reality restrictions imposed by officials are often premised upon ill defined concepts of social stability state security and sedition that mask what is in fact mere intolerance of dissent
2931536 i think the guys are looking forward to it this season will be a new challenge for us
2931537 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931538 its 10 40 in the morning in london what time is it in moscow
2931539 mr rude told me to phone his wife for him
2931540 i have to answer the phone and write a lot of emails
2931541 i have to get up early and i dont like it
2931542 i had to see the boss about something important and it took a long time
2931543 i have no idea when the teacher is going home
2931544 if you throw salt over your shoulder youll have good luck
2931545 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2931546 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at this as half empty or half full
2931547 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2931548 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2931549 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2931550 if you look at the replay it goes right under the wall
2931551 unfortunately we were the better team for 70 minutes we let two points get away from us
2931552 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931553 i thought there would be some trouble though not this bad when i heard their decision i couldnt help a bitter smile it was the same thing that happened to me in the past the same thing that many directors have experienced i bet even the official who made the announcement was bored
2931554 the political system is more flexible the economy is growing fast and the relationship between people is more equal
2931555 i dont understand why the authorities are so sensitive about 1989 they shouldnt worry about it the facts are out there already analysis of those facts still requires a lot of work but im not trying to make a comment this movie is just a love story set against that background
2931556 i think the most fundamental reason is that they think movies are a form of politics if that was their opinion 10 years ago i could fully understand but the reality today is not like that in 2006 films are part of the entertainment industry
2931557 what is more important is what is going on inside the characters this is a journey of the soul of a female chinese intellectual such a trip could only happen here
2931558 ive never been antagonistic toward those official agencies ive been feeling my way along where are the lines
2931559 the picture was too fuzzy and the sound was too low
2931560 lou ye tried out some new artistic methods in this film but the committee of censors judged it as not being up to technical standards this struck a blow to the director and he cannot accept this result at present
2931561 the ruling against yahoo china is extremely significant in clarifying copyright rules for internet music services in china

2931566 im going to give it one more day then try to be ready to go about every single day in september
2931567 im not real worried about it at the same time i dont want to keep on plowing through something and make it worse i just need to give it a couple days to get some inflammation out of there
2931568 thats where he could have gotten soreness and hes just now working out of it
2931569 i cant honestly say the all star game is what did it
2931570 i felt kind of funky before that but when i was pitching in a lot of games straight it felt better then it started feeling bad again when i took a couple days off
2931571 looking back there was no real time to say i should nip it in the bud now it just happened to be in the last couple days it became a little aggravated its just a simple case of bicep tendinitis theres no cause for alarm
2931572 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931573 if you hadnt missed the bus because of your broken leg then your boss wouldnt have been angry with you
2931574 id rather watch a movie than go to a play
2931575 his call what the bleep am i supposed to do
2931576 two kind of i guess strong willed people that had a disagreement

2931579 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931580 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931581 i saw the ball go by me off to the right
2931582 after i saw the ball go by i realized i could make it to second but when i turned to go to second base randy was right there i really had nowhere to go i just talked to him to see if he was ok and he said he was watching the ball as well so it was one of those things
2931583 but i dont want to keep plugging through it and make it worse were just giving it a couple days to let the inflammation out the doctors looked at it its no cause for alarm we just want to make sure we nip it in the bud
2931584 my shoulder was feeling sluggish a little before and after the all star game i dont know if it contributed
2931585 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931586 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931587 we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old and they get lined up and the government backs them and the federation runs away
2931588 there is an age limit and it cant be controlled
2931589 a fortune teller told me if i changed my name i would go far so i changed it because i wanted to go to the olympics
2931590 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931591 it will be nice to play some good ball weve been playing decent ball but i dont think weve peaked yet
2931592 were too good an offensive team to hit the way we have
2931593 all it takes is one pitch one swing one at bat to get going
2931594 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931595 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931596 its been weird this game is crazy were not necessarily putting up booming numbers or playing the kind of baseball were capable of playing but at the end of the day were in first place and we know its going to get better
2931597 its getting to the point where people are starting to count games and its up to us to go out and play good baseball
2931598 we need to get on a little bit of a roll its going to be a tough road trip for us
2931599 we did just enough yesterday and i think thats a good sign when youre not running on all cylinders and can still win some baseball games were playing decent baseball hopefully we can peak at the right time ive seen a lot of teams peak in the middle of the season and have nothing left at the end i dont think weve peaked yet i think we have a lot of good baseball in us
2931600 as i made my turn randy was right in front of me
2931601 i was like oh hi i felt bad i tried to grab him but i think i ended up pushing him i dont round the bag too often i felt like i was in little league
2931602 i think he could run out of daylight in an 8 day week
2931603 recently weve come away with some wins and at times we havent played good
2931604 were definitely capable of playing better and were going to

2931664 i would obviously like to have earned a spot on the team by finishing in the top eight in the ryder cup standings
2931665 but i still have two events to prove im good enough to be there azingers in a very difficult position there are a lot of players he could take whatever his decisions im sure hell make the right ones
2931666 i just had a bad day i didnt play very well im human i played pretty well the first 2 days my putter kind of left me today ive been playing well for the last 3 weeks i dont think one day should make or break you its disappointing but everyone has bad days this was just a bad time to do it
2931667 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931668 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2931669 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2931670 we wanted to get him in early to play against the best and i thought he handled it extremely well
2931671 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2931672 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2931673 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931674 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2931675 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2931676 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931677 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2931678 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931679 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2931680 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2931681 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931682 those are just the olympic rules youve got to beat everybody at the olympics regardless if youre seeded one two or whatever you are youve got to beat the best teams thats what we plan to do regardless of seed
2931683 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931684 and especially to do this in a win is kind of the icing on the cake im very honored
2931685 but it would be great i guess its somewhat of a goal i can aim for but its a goal thats far off
2931686 anytime im put in that situation i want to do what i can to help the team whether it be a hit move a guy over sacrifice fly walk it doesnt always have to be a hit if it ends up being a hit so be it
2931687 you can turn numbers into whatever you want to make them
2931688 to me thats my responsibility to pitch and be successful but i wouldnt be in that situation if i didnt have a good defense behind me
2931689 there comes a time when youve got to do what you think is right
2931690 thats kind of how i manage and run my team
2931691 i will handle things and i do handle things i think its up to a manager not to accept someone showing them up i can understand someone getting upset but at the same time whoever is in charge has to make sure hes in charge
2931692 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931693 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2931694 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2931695 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2931696 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2931697 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2931698 maybe thats why it hurt so much iit just felt so close

2931715 were easing him back in he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2931716 i was kind of gauging him on how he felt rick was communicating with him during the practice we actually got more out of him than what i anticipated
2931717 hell pick it up and be fine but itll be a learning process
2931718 you cant get a feel for each other until you get in a game where you have to communicate you do develop some chemistry in practice but the reality is youve got to play together in a game
2931719 it makes it even more important that we get the film study in before the first regular season game
2931720 when youre out there and youre doing it at practice you get in a rhythm the quarterback and receivers always talk about developing timing
2931721 its the same when youre out there with a defensive back youve been playing with when i come over in coverage you dont even have to say anything you know what each others going to do but when youre not able to do it together youve got to get it in the film room because youre kind of forced to start slow
2931722 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931723 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2931724 but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2931725 yeah he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2931726 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with andrews
2931727 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931728 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931729 to get him for me was like milwaukee getting cc sabathia
2931730 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931731 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931732 this is not going to be a one day event
2931733 this wasnt a spring practice event theres nothing in the book of football that says youve got to make decisions based upon this starting time is it built into the mind set of football that quicker is better yeah but its nothing thats etched in stone i mean we made the decision to play two quarterbacks on a sunday 6 days before techs 40 21 win against florida state last season you make it work
2931734 i feel like im a pretty good quarterback and tyrod is a pretty good quarterback too
2931735 its hard to say one is really head and shoulders above the other the coaches say theyre not going to make a decision on either one of us until theres an obvious difference between the two
2931736 it keeps us to where we can go out there and compete every day the coaches make the call when theyre ready its their call to make well find out when theyre ready to tell us
2931737 i havent been thinking about it of course everyone wants to play but its still the coaches call
2931738 there was something about that murder that outraged me completely
2931739 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2931740 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful
2931741 im going to gradually feed him back in i just want to see how hes doing thats my primary focus right now then well see about those other things well see where they fall in
2931742 he made it through this much of camp without a problem which he hasnt done in the past it has always happened sooner than this i guess im looking for a positive in the situation i expect him to get out and be ready to go here in the next little bit
2931743 enjoys starting at guard but if you asked him his choice hes going to tell you tackle
2931744 thats what he sees himself as hes doing a heck of a job right now at guard too hes having his best camp so far
2931745 with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra isnt out there id rather play tackle
2931746 i feel like its a little easier on your body and you get to use a little more of your athleticism at tackle instead of brute force i was a little rusty at it today
2931747 i think he could step in and be one of the better left tackles in this league he just hasnt had a chance to work there
2931748 ive been anxious ever since we got to camp to see shawn

2931812 you cant complain too much when you score four goals away from home and i knew it would be a tough match but i didnt think we would concede that many goals

2931845 we havent modelled that but we would not expect it to have any impact
2931846 senator what i am saying is that the prices you are talking about are generally set in international markets and this would not have any impact on those prices
2931847 as far as we are aware no approaches have been made to treasury for a meeting from the north west shelf
2931848 just because you want to achieve a particular result to use one policy tool such as the carbon production reduction scheme or whatever its called that doesnt mean you need to have an uneven situation for another policy tool
2931849 we would not expect this to have any impact on exploration in other areas but we have not necessarily modelled that in particular either
2931850 many farmers went into organic production when the outlook for conventional farming especially milk production was fairly bleak and the return was 16p 19p per litre they were looking at organic milk fetching 34p 35p within an increasing demand
2931851 suddenly things changed and the price of conventional milk rose to 25p 26p at a time when many farmers were at the very difficult point of their conversion
2931852 theyre converting the land from the use of chemicals and relying on clover sward for nitrogen but this hasnt had time to be properly established youre not applying nitrogen to the surface but the clover isnt established yet it takes a leap of faith
2931853 a number of farmers who were already under pressure from the strict disciplines of organic farming decided to revert to conventional but it was a relatively low percentage

2931868 thats the reality of football i know for certain some of the players whove left our club in the past have spoken long and hard with coaches at other club
2931869 we know where theyre at we need to consider how the others are and then make some choices
2931870 players argue when we win too and its only really highlighted when you lose he said
2931871 i suppose the tradition of the club here is you demand a lot from each other and i know over the years we won premiership after premiership wed argue with each other and demand a lot from each other and try to keep the standard up so im sure thats a lot of it and i suppose carlton arent used to that

2931881 they said he was vomiting and had to be rushed to the hospital about 3 25am when the doctors eventually saw him he was dead
2931882 where is the money how much have they gotten and where is it how are we feeling the impact of this money from lng as a nation before they move to train seven
2931883 so the senate will not support train seven of bonny lng we will not support it until proper account of trains one to six are given to the nigerian people so we advise them to render proper account to the nnpc
2931884 we had raised the issue with the nnpc in the past and we expect that should be done before they can contemplate this issue of train seven
2931885 when this thing was done 10 years ago they were given all manners of incentives so that they could come into the business but today those incentives can no longer stand the test of time much as they have 10 years to run we will like to find out whether those incentives are supposed to cover for train one or two
2931886 these incentives if you open it up critically are like dashing these people this gas and getting no money out of it for a country that is greatly blessed in gas resources like nigeria
2931887 if you can notice in the last three days every julius bergers vehicle that we have arrested in any vehicle infringement we have sent to court we want to know the status of your drivers as it affects alcohols drug testing drug testing and the health policy of the company
2931888 we convened this meeting earlier today and the julius berger team came and i insisted that the managing director of julius berger plc should come because i wanted to underscore the important of human lives
2931889 i wanted to underscore the important of the road safety standardization scheme we have in place at the frsc and to underscore the fact that road safety is put before all other issues because if it was a plane crash involving julius berger plc plane the whole world will be informed it will be on the cnn bbc and even if it is three people that are involved everybody will turn up
2931890 we the downtrodden and almost forgotten masses of the nigerian railway corporation pensioners do hereby once again cry out for help

2931893 our fears are deepened by the federal governments policy of retiring unspent funds by december of each appropriation year
2931894 the death of this pacesetter must not go uncelebrated our celebration of this developer of the pen profession should start from the media family and then government it would not be a bad idea if the nuj national headquarters is named after him as part of our conscious effort to immortalize him
2931895 the federal government may also in its own wisdom name the radio house babatunde jose house this is one way to say thank you posthumously to a man who did his best to promote the fourth estate of the realm
2931896 the death of alhaji babatunde jose foremost journalist and pen pusher of no ordinary description has created a vacuum in the journalism profession especially for upcoming ones who should ordinarily see him as a role model
2931897 the eulogies obsequies and epitaphs that have watered the pages of newspapers in the last couple of weeks are indicative of the strength of character strong personality and deep level of influence of this exemplary role model who contributed his all in developing a very critical sector of our national life
2931898 for the past two weeks i have tried to assume the right frame of mind to join millions of others to condole the family and pray allah to grant him eternal rest having been jolted by the sudden announcement of his demise even though he lived a fulfilled life and impacted positively on national life the mere fact that he is gone to be seen no more makes the thought emotionally painful for me and my family
2931899 i maintained and enjoyed very good mutually beneficial relationship with alhaji babatunde jose and gained tremendously from his wisdom and counsel during my regime as military president of this great country nigeria
2931900 as an avid reader i enjoyed his style and learned a few vocabularies from his presentations he was thorough in his production used the right word to describe situations and left his readers spell bound by his graphic presentation his essays breathed life and it was easy to see the energy he put into them to make them usually signature classic
2931901 look i am from the united states of america i have come to represent some financial institutions we have money to disburse for any serious willing investor
2931902 when the fire started i personally contacted the onitsha main market fire service officials on phone through the main market security outfit but the inability of the fire service to respond quickly contributed to the market being razed down completely
2931903 it is unfortunate that the incident occurred now that the state is enjoying a peaceful atmosphere
2931904 when the west told us that we dont need steel plants that the ones we were building were white elephant projects
2931905 it was clear they did not want to see us industrialised but i knew that everything about civilisation has got to do with steel so we pursued it
2931906 it then became apparently clear to the military government headed by gowon that the west had no sincere desire to help nigeria develop a steel plant
2931907 you cannot get better brains and ideas than this group of people they are the best and we are not going to joke with their ideas
2931908 that is why it is such an emotional thing to see it lying waste 30 years after its conception
2931909 ajaokuta steel had been on the drawing board for more than 30 years and over the period other african countries and saudi arabia which started at the same period as nigeria have made tremendous progress
2931910 ich fing 1982 an spiele zu programmieren nach ein paar anl ufen gelang es mir 1985 mit hellowoon mein erstes game zu ver ffentlichen danach kamen noch ein paar weitere text adventures die ich mit meinem schulfreund hans j rgen br ndle zusammen erstellte 1989 beschlossen wir einen weiteren schulfreund jochen hamma mit aufzunehmen attic entertainment software war geboren nachdem wir von diversen publishern ganz brutal abgeledert wurden beschlossen wir 1991 unsere games in zukunft selbst zu publishen das war ein riesenschritt weil wir von dem moment an eben fast alles komplett selbst machen mussten ich blicke immer wieder gern darauf zur ck wie wir n chtelang in meiner wohnung wie die irren auf etwa 10 amigas disketten kopierten um sie am n chsten tag dann zu labeln und mit handbuch in einer box zu verpacken das war auch in etwa die zeit als wir die dsa nordland trilogie in angriff nahmen nach dem dritten teil habe ich attic und deutschland verlassen und mich in s dkalifornien niedergelassen
2931911 meine partner hans j rgen br ndle jochen hamma und ich haben selbst rege das schwarze auge gespielt und hatten immer davon getr umt eines tages ein dsa computerspiel zu machen eines tages bekamen wir dann pl tzlich aus heiterem himmel einen telefonanruf mit der frage ob wir interessiert w ren
2931912 projekte dieser gr enordnung haben permanent ups und downs im gro en und ganzen wars eine menge spa und zu sehen dass unser werk damals international anerkennung fand war f r uns alle glaube ich sehr sch n au er uns und blue byte gab es damals keine deutsche firma die produkte in europa den usa und asien am markt hatte an frus trationen kann ich mich nicht mehr erinnern nach so langer zeit sieht man alles durch eine art rosa brille denke ich
2931913 ich w rde es nicht mehr so extrem am pen amp paper spiel orientieren inhaltlich nat rlich schon aber von der bedienung und den attributen k nnte man das schon etwas anwenderfreundlicher machen als wir das mit der nordland trilogie getan haben
2931914 ich schaue mir das spiel immer wieder an ja die jungs von radon labs haben mich vor zwei jahren bereits kontaktiert um mir erste demos zu zeigen und von mir etwas feedback zu bekommen was hat bei der nordland trilogie funktionert was kam nicht so bei den leuten an einfach ein freundlicher informationsaustausch seither habe ich das game immer mal wieder gesehen mir gef llt es sehr gut die atmosph re ist prima und jedesmal wenn ich es sehe f hle ich mich sofort nach aventurien versetzt
2931915 nein ich habe an solch gro en projekten kein interesse mehr ich habe zwar generell schon noch interesse am rollenspielmarkt aber nicht in der form von vierjahresprojekten mit 50 teammitgliedern und so fort dem teufelskreis bin ich gl cklich entsprungen
2931916 ich denke es wird immer ein publikum f r gute rollenspiele geben keine frage das problem ist dass die erwartungshaltung der industrie heute sehr uniform ist spiele m ssen heute auf kommerz getrimmt werden publisher und deren marketing leute die in aller regel von games keine ahnung haben diktieren den entwicklern wie das spiel auszusehen hat dazu kommt die erwartungshaltung der presse dass jedes spiel mindestens ein drei ig millionen dollar budget braucht und immer die neueste technologie ausnutzt spieldesign wird heutzutage konstant mit technischem design verwechselt und anstatt mehr spa in die games zu packen werden stattdessen immer mehr unn tige effekte und noch mehr polygone und texturen reingepackt all das ist kontraproduktiv und dient wirklich nur dazu immer mehr immer teurere spiele imitationen zu vermarkten die in ihrem kern aber total verarmt sind rollenspiele leben aber von ihrem kern der story der welt den figuren dem wahren game design leider sehe ich kaum einen major publisher ein solches projekt anfassen weil ein rollenspiel im markt nie die akzeptanz eines shooters wie bioshock haben wird das rpg element wird bei solchen versuchen rollenspiele gro er publisher anm d red immer total verw ssert und am ende kommen spiele heraus die die echten rollenspieler einfach nicht recht ansprechen der rollenspielmarkt ist und wird immer ein nischenmarkt bleiben wenn es also richtige rollenspiele geben wird in zukunft werden die von kleinen indie publishern unabh ngige publisher hnlich den independent labels in der musikbranche anm d red kommen denen es um die spiele geht und nicht um die erwartungen ihrer aktion re oder das dritte eigenheim auf den fidschi inseln
2931917 die welt die atmosph re und der spielspa alles andere ist f r mich pers nlich zweitrangig

2931924 people do not believe in god because they have given long and careful thought to the matter they do so because they have been infected by a powerful meme
2931925 memes are trivial to be banished by simple mental exercises in any wider context they are hopelessly if not hilariously simplistic
2931926 we believe in evolution because the evidence supports it and we would abandon it overnight if new evidence arose to disprove it no real fundamentalist would ever say anything like that

2931977 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2931978 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2931979 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities

2932034 in europe real incomes are not going up due to rising prices but in russia its different
2932035 because the domestic economy is growing like crazy incomes are still going up like crazy
2932036 if i see a new place which i want to go into i do worry what the service will be like
2932037 you pick a place to eat where you know the service will be good
2932038 we were unbelievably frustrated two years ago because we would get these people in and we would just want them to smile and they wouldnt even know why
2932039 the customer five years ago in russia would have been only too happy if within five minutes walk there was a place to have a coffee latte
2932040 in russia the moment you give somebody a title they stop working
2932041 now we give people more money and more responsibility but not a new title
2932042 turkey has maneuvered to create an anti kurdish iraqi parliament
2932043 it is behind the adoption of article 24 of the electoral law as it is trying by all means to reduce the gains made by the kurds after the fall of saddam hussein
2932044 the increase could be attributed in part to a series of investment related reforms plus a program of privatization which turkey had introduced in 2003 in order to improve the investment climate and to facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment
2932045 the major achievement has been the enactment of the new fdi law in june 2003
2932046 there is not a place of worship in schools in germany
2932047 even the top court banned the religious symbols from being displayed in classes s zen purposely tries to mislead the public and aims to convert the national education system into a religious one
2932048 the german youth protection law regulates the situations under which circumstances children are allowed to enter bars and discos and consume alcohol
2932049 it doesnt include such an arrangement for schools to secure a place of worship for students
2932050 we sow watermelon in adana they said they would give our money but had not given half of it claiming that watermelons are parched under sun is this our guilt
2932051 scorpion stung my son in yozgat we hardly moved him to hospital while we were coming to ordu from yozgat we almost died of airlessness at the back of the truck i cut a little piece from the canvas of the truck to get air however the driver wanted the cost of the canvas which was ytl 200 and half of the money we earned was paid to that later we took the canvas of the truck and turned it into a tent we will go back to home in autumn however there is no money left
2932052 these graves reveal istanbul used to be home to some of the earliest types of settlements during the stone age when people migrated from anatolia to the european continent
2932053 they also show that the marmara sea used to be a small and shallow water in ancient times
2932054 particularly the excavations carried out in the fikirtepe district have yielded fruitful results
2932055 we are thankful to sinan etin his assistant adil o uz and to all our celebrities that took part in the films in spite of their busy programs they accepted to execute such a project without expecting any profit
2932056 that our president has given a positive reply to the invitation is definitely an important step but more important than that is establishing a dialogue between the two peoples the turks and the armenians we are not politicians but we will be in yerevan on september 6 in the name of peace and friendship fifty of us will be there to form a bridge but hundreds of us will follow in the near future
2932057 some ears might not perceive karlens and eriks voice as a strong one but to us their voice is one free from hatred and enmity we were deeply impressed when we read the interview in which these two strong and self confident young people from armenia expressed themselves and the way they look with hope to the future without denying the past
2932058 as karlen and erik pointed out no matter what words you utter to describe those events in history they would not alleviate the pain caused by them
2932059 traumas can only be overcome through mutual understanding having close contacts sharing the pains and listening to each other
2932060 for historians too voice an official rhetoric just as politicians do
2932061 we have begun for some time debating about our thoughts freely in turkey the biggest problem between the turks and the armenians is just a lack of a healthy and full fledged communication we members of the two societies might begin a dialogue by detaching ourselves from politics we truly do not need official ideologies anymore
2932062 lets recall the past years when we turks and greeks came to the brink of war because of the kardak rocks just some small rocks on the aegean sea but today we are extending olive branches to each other and again becoming immersed in each others songs
2932063 so why shouldnt such normalization take place in turkey armenia relations as well within ten years for instance i see no obstacles to that
2932064 there in that stadium we shall stand shoulder to shoulder together with our friends from the armenian community of istanbul and we shall altogether cry out for peace and friendliness in fact we shall be hugging each other in that stadium as hrant would do if he had lived
2932065 the head of the hadrians culture which has been discovered in the antique city of sagalassos is now exhibited in england as the excavations continue and the artifacts will be a part of the collection of burdur museum the museum will be among the select few of the worlds museums especially the artifacts from the antique city of sagalassos receive interest both domestically and from abroad
2932066 it has a diversity of cultures and dissimilarity that has been a part of europe since the beginning of history
2932067 re endorse the public health message of the beneficial effect of increasing total fruit and vegetable intake

2932070 the economy is decelerating sharply the correction in the construction sector is still ongoing and the outlook for the near to medium term is rather bleak
2932071 we believe the deterioration of spain is just in the beginning stages
2932072 the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
2932073 overthrowing geography jaffa tel aviv and the struggle for palestine
2932074 the goal of the book was to create public discussion
2932075 generate within the muslim world a greater understanding of this music and in the west the idea that being a muslim and a metal head arent mutually exclusive
2932076 the issue is not about religion or secularism there are a lot of similarities in the grassroots activism on the secularist left musicians and long haired activists and anarchists who were at bar a and the more conservative people who represent erdo an
2932077 it is the businesses and governments everywhere that are trying to keep them apart if these two poles of the culture come together they are going to bring with them everyone in between and the governments are going to be in trouble
2932078 i think turkey has been at the vanguard of the development of popular music as a legitimate means of expression
2932079 without having to get the corporate money it can afford to be more politicized which you couldnt do in dubai or morocco or lebanon because neither governments nor sponsors would allow it
2932080 because of the freedoms in turkey its own metal scene tends to have a lot less edge than its other muslim counterparts tending to be a lot less underground
2932081 on the other hand musicians are able to say things and proclaim causes unimaginable in other countries in the region
2932082 turkey has long been at the forefront of cultural hybridity and music is crossing the bridge obviously
2932083 i think turkish metal can be more of a hybrid than other forms of metal in the middle east in other countries it sounds much more like american or european metal
2932084 we were doing that 40 years ago the key for us is that we never just copied the west
2932085 it needs to be supervised to reveal whether the organization acts in accordance with the criteria of economic efficiency and profitability
2932086 some of the acts of tok which has constructed tens of thousands of residential projects have caused controversy in society
2932087 first of all we need to question whether tok s projects really target and provide the financing of the housing projects for lower and middle income groups
2932088 while there is a 100 percent rise in fertilizer prices and 30 percent in fuel oil prices the government should start to implement the marginal payment support system which was regulated for supply deficit products in the tobacco code and specifies the seed cotton premium at least ykr 50 for the 2007 product
2932089 the premium rate that will be specified will draw the road map of the future of turkeys cotton production whether the producers will keep sowing cotton or they will terminate plantation through decreasing the production rate with each passing year
2932090 cotton which is a vegetative raw material of textile has a considerable role in both turkeys and the worlds agricultural industry and trade
2932091 despite its strategic importance the cotton production rate unfortunately declines in turkey year by year there is a 20 percent decline in plantation area in 2007 to 2008 business year compared to the previous year and we expect the decline to continue this year as well
2932092 the deterioration in cotton production is a matter that concerns turkeys future
2932093 there will be no competitiveness in cotton production without more public support
2932094 allocating additional premiums we should switch the supply surplus products to supply deficit products as it is the policy of the ministry of agriculture
2932095 the minimum rent on the houses in the region begins at ytl 400 000 while the rent of the houses in the housing complexes is not greater than ytl 900 meanwhile these levels reach ytl 1 200 in high quality projects
2932096 the construction of the exhibition center which started in april 2007 continues without ceasing
2932097 the construction of the first stage of a two staged project continues the exhibition center which sits on an area of 83 500 square meters will be comprised of a hotel with a 600 bed capacity a congress hall with a 3 000 person capacity open and closed parking garages restaurants and stores similar to the ones in kapal ar
2932098 the exhibition center will be established with the method of build operate transfer and thus the municipality will not have to spend any money for the project the second stage of the project will sit on an area of 820 000 square meters
2932099 in five years 947 farmers have installed modern irrigation systems by using loans worth ytl 21 million and started using the decreasing water sources more efficiently
2932100 within this context 1 373 farmers have been trained about irrigation and the economic usage of water in 54 residential areas in 2007 to 2008 besides 68 farmers in ye ilova yenikent sultanhan were given certificates at the end of their training periods and secured as voluntary irrigation circulators our training periods for farmers to use modern irrigation techniques will continue
2932101 georgian police forces were waiting on the bridgehead lines due to the clashes all the civilian vehicles which operate between tblisi and ossetia were carrying soldiers i heard that the bridges were attacked after i passed meanwhile those residing near the region have started to move toward tblisi
2932102 i passed near the georgian cities of tskhinvali and gori i heard the voices of bombs and cannons many of our friends are changing their routes and trying to reach turkish border checkpoints by passing through paths that are far from the combat area
2932103 it is not possible to pass the customs bureau until the war is over even the customs agents went to fight in the war bombs are exploding all around us there is no one in the streets i take refuge in a calm area nobody knows what to do next it is impossible to cross over here give your blessing it is a life or death situation
2932104 turkish truck drivers are stuck in the middle of war as in the case of aslan and they have difficulty in returning to turkey
2932105 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
2932106 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
2932107 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
2932108 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
2932109 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
2932110 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
2932111 the marketing company will actually serve for the regulation of the market we will buy the product at the market to control low prices and low quality while forming a commodity exchange which is a center to sell and purchase products we are also preparing the infrastructure of a center that provides stock brokering services
2932112 we plan to enter all of the developing tea markets in these regions particularly in georgia in coordination we will run all activities from the plantation to the sale points by mixing turkish tea and the tea produced in these regions we will market at russia and former turkic republics
2932113 in the upcoming five to 10 years we plan to produce 100 000 tons tea derivatives such as herbal tea will also come up our basic target is to elevate turkish tea which has a bad reputation in the world market
2932114 we plan to prepare the foundation until the shoot of 2009
2932115 we still plan to establish a partnership and it will be a vestel company on the other hand we have been cooperating with vestfrost which is now a subsidiary of ours for two years the company buys the products which it sells under its own brand from vestel now we are looking forward to expanding in europe and russia through this brand
2932116 i wouldnt be surprised if we are at 50 50 here and abroad by the end of 2010
2932117 it doesnt mean we are going to sell canadian assets but rather that a good chunk of our investments will be made abroad we are going to add to our portfolio in countries where we expect long term growth
2932118 we invested 30 million in georgia which draws attention as an energy corridor we cannot give up on this country
2932119 there has always been a vivacity in the region since we launched our investments but the recently increasing tension led the investors to secure the production facilities tighter
2932120 the communication lines are out of service here as of now
2932121 the communication systems such as telephone and internet are down and this causes us troubles
2932122 we are trying to be in touch with the government officials via the embassies the security of our workers is quite important for us we have 120 personnel in our storage facilities and 10 percent of them are turkish workers we warned them not to leave the region and there is no problem around our facility now
2932123 there are many of foreign investors here usually the investors blench and reconsider their investments in the region in such cases but georgia is a place that you cannot reconsider the investments due to its strategic importance in terms of the energy area
2932124 all the investors and governmental officials should take responsibility and end the hostilities
2932125 the countries of the region are developing quickly and receiving important investments everyone is aware of the potential of the region countries while the trade volume between turkey and the region countries we consider to operate in this region for very long term the region has a key importance for our projects
2932126 the foreign trucks are waiting as well as turkish trucks
2932127 war causes the investor and the exporter to blench and now we are experiencing such a process the doors are open but the trucks are waiting
2932128 the sarp border gate which opens turkey to key destinations has a great importance to turkey it loomed large with its convenience recently it provides access to azerbaijan and the turkic republics the transitions are going on but the loaded vehicles are not allowed to pass
2932129 the consumer goods are rather transported over the region we will wait and see what will happen in the upcoming period the developments will lead the transport sector to specify what to do in case the war continues and enlarges the exports to georgia will be affected heavily everyone has to do the best to stop this war
2932130 what is happening in south ossetia will cause turkeys exports to the region countries to decline and it will affect us negatively
2932131 turkish drivers are leaving their vehicles in poti port which has heavily been damaged by the russian bombs and escaping safe places
2932132 even if the conflicts end the relationships between turkey and georgia will never be the same without an absolute compromise
2932133 unless the uncertainties and the confidence issues are sold there will be a stagnation in commercial activities this will cause a vast loss in our exports
2932134 there is no problem with the russia for the time being
2932135 we do not foresee a problem with russia in terms of the exports
2932136 the evaluations we made during the hike in rice prices overlap with the prices in domestic market during that period we said that there were ample products and that the rise derived from the world
2932137 we said that the consumption would drop due to the price hike and then the prices would decline the development occurred just in that direction rice prices deteriorated 20 to 25 percent since the crisis
2932138 looking into the situation more concretely i suppose that these price increases cannot stem from production however routine price creases will take place we should watch other products rather than rice there may be price rise in lentil as well as boiled and pounded wheat
2932139 the harvest will launch in 20 to 25 days and there are ample products on the stocks moreover a certain amount from the previous period will be transferred to the new season it is impossible to witness a rise in rice prices during ramadan
2932140 this year productivity will also be high prices will decline 50 percent moreover tmo has ample amount of rice
2932141 besides rice some may try to increase the prices of legumes such as red lentil chickpea haricot bean by stocking the prices may rise also with the export limitations of rice producer countries
2932142 according to our initial predictions the worlds rice production will rise 2 3 percent to reach a new record level of 666 million tons

2932160 we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement
2932161 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2932162 the georgians must pull out of south ossetia and must agree to sign a document of non use of force in south ossetia
2932163 two thousand killed is it enough for you thirty thousand refugees is that enough for you
2932164 how many people have to be killed for genocide its genocide to the south ossetians
2932165 the violence has to stop foreign forces have to be withdrawn
2932166 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2932167 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone including the bombing of the upper kodori valley
2932168 to fulfill the duty ordered by the commander without questioning why such an order is given even if the order is the oddest ever you might have heard of
2932169 acting under your order we are watering the trees along the program devised by my senior officer and approved by you sir
2932170 watering trees under rain because the commander said so was a sign of good discipline
2932171 if your soldiers start questioning the orders you gave how can you order to engage in a fight to the death with an enemy even if the order might appear to be an odd one a good soldier never questions the order he receives
2932172 the duty officer will decide whether or not there is sufficient rainfall and decide accordingly whether there is need to water the trees
2932173 there should not be a regional divide or a communal divide
2932174 it lets you know the words someone would have to type into a search engine for your particular press release to be found and helps put your release at the top of the search engine
2932175 we have done for 412 press releases that incorporate that word so far in 2008 up from 261 last year
2932176 thanks to american military aid georgias 18 000 strong armed forces are the best trained and equipped fighting force in the caucasus
2932177 but it is one thing for them to defeat the raggle taggle militia of a tin pot place like south ossetia population 70 000 it is another for a country of less than five million people to take on russia population 142 million
2932178 reinforcements are pouring in and the kremlins mighty propaganda machine is lumbering into action while a cyber attack appears to have crippled georgias websites
2932179 together with military aid and training from the u s britain and turkey and the experience of its forces in iraq this has helped to modernize and improve the professionalism of certain units however many units including the large reserve forces remain poorly equipped and trained
2932180 russias forces are overwhelmingly superior and their equipment more modern and more serviceable than georgias
2932181 turkey does not have much to do it is already doing what it can
2932182 this war is about a big sharing deal that began with the independence of kosovo kosovo abkhazia south ossetia they are all pieces that will slowly fall into place
2932183 this is a game to decide the place of georgia in between the west and russia russia hinted that there may be problems as georgia approached the west
2932184 war is a result of the contest for global hegemony
2932185 turkey is in a difficult position but it can do nothing more than to try to bring the two sides to the negotiating table
2932186 turkey will also stick to georgian territorial integrity but only by declaring its opinion in principle
2932187 it is impossible to understand turkeys military support for georgia we have a connection with turkey from the past
2932188 if all ethnic minorities start implementing their own foreign policy vision turkey cannot move nearly all groups want to protect their own ethnic relatives turkey has this experience and will not take an adventurous step
2932189 turkey is a nato member and it sends military aid to many places stability in georgia and keeping russians away from its borders as much as possible is in turkeys interests
2932190 all georgian armed forces have been withdrawn from the zone of conflict
2932191 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2932192 by a decree of abkhaz president sergei bagapsh a state of war has been introduced in part of the republics territory
2932193 we felt it coming instinctively it was just a matter of time
2932194 we watch tv the georgian and russian channels and surf the net to try to untangle the truth from fiction and get an idea of what is happening in south ossetia
2932195 i would have preferred simply to return home but you cannot choose the circumstances it falls on us to defend our country
2932196 we have received the green light from tbilisi we do not yet know when and where we are going
2932197 when they call their families our soldiers do not speak too much of our plan we are afraid that the russians listen to our phones
2932198 i have two children and in the past 14 months that i have been in iraq i can see they have grown in the pictures my wife sent me
2932199 professionally speaking we have learned a lot knowing how to work and move together
2932200 this will serve against the russians even if the fight will be very different and even though i have no illusions of the power of the russian army
2932201 one knows that we cannot win against russia with its latest weaponry
2932202 we have not finished our mission in iraq but we must leave our american friends
2932203 who wants to talk in order to find a solution not to prevent a solution
2932204 while the u s investment total is down compared to last years impressive second quarter we still saw steady deal activity and investment in the first half of the year which is encouraging
2932205 venture capitalists commonly take the long view when it comes to investing while ipos and acquisitions may be rare now vcs arent consumed about that theyre focusing on whats next and thats reflected in the healthy early stage investment were seeing in areas like renewable energy information services and business support services
2932206 web 2 0 companies was the only area within it to see positive gains with 688 million invested in 80 deals a 20 increase over the 572 million invested in 94 deals during the same period last year
2932207 the health care industry is the most concerning at the moment as investment is down 31 compared to the first six months of last year and deal flow is at its lowest level in three years
2932208 considering the amount of time and capital it takes vcs to build a successful life science company there may be a hesitation to continue investing in these companies given our current ipo market conditions
2932209 the movement of venture dollars from the traditional areas of information technology and health care toward burgeoning sectors like renewable energy power management and agriculture or
2932210 the most encouraging part of this quarters report is that early stage investing is holding relatively steady thus far in 2008
2932211 it may be harder for entrepreneurial companies to raise venture capital these days but its by no means impossible continued early stage deal flow is a good sign that the venture industry is prepared to weather the economic downturn and will continue to back the next wave of disruptive technologies
2932212 im from new york and i live next door to anthony perkins
2932213 akp appointed people from its circle to certain official positions
2932214 our craftsman has been working there since the new year although we have been talking this project for a year
2932215 the prisoners became very excited when they earned the right to health services
2932216 the unemployment rate among university graduates is almost 20 percent this is a very high rate we should teach youngsters vocations that they can find jobs
2932217 workmanship is so critical in this job labor is cheap there and they are in this business for years
2932218 the number of nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit should have been double at that time we informed the health ministry many times but they were short of personnel too
2932219 none of the newborns who died were healthy all of them were at risk of death and they had very low weights
2932220 many babies were born in july and deaths of newborns increased relatively statistically the number of births and the newborn deaths is high in january too
2932221 there was something wrong with his right thigh yesterday and i gave him an injection today
2932222 he felt so so this morning but chose to continue
2932223 i dont know what happened to nurcan i was just concentrating on my own attempts
2932224 i knew i could do a lot better than the competition i wanted the gold
2932225 i will cooperate with the kurds on everything except on kirkuk
2932226 jason finished the race better than we could have asked for
2932227 but we think about that more than michael does he just takes it one race at a time
2932228 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2932229 at the end you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
2932230 i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope said lezak
2932231 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50 meters
2932232 i feel like i should have gotten my hand on the wall first
2932233 i gave it everything i had possible but she got me in the end
2932234 i would be baffled if you do not say that was perfect
2932235 time is something to be smashed anytime but at the moment that i marked 58 seconds i probably should have been happier
2932236 now i have to go and take care of myself tonight because tomorrow its going to be a tight race
2932237 if i wasnt as self deprecating as i am what i say on the show may come off as bitchy or catty but that has never been my intention and i dont have a catty bone in my body
2932238 i think they saw a couple funny clips from the style shows on the soup and realized there was a whole world out there that needed to be made fun of
2932239 like for project runway the soup would air a crazy clip where someone gets stabbed with a pair of scissors but there are 20 other moments to talk about theres not enough time in the soup format to do that so thats where the dish would pick up
2932240 if the soup can kick the kardashians in the shins then style better be ready
2932241 im sure theres going to come a time when im going to have to discuss something about someone i know and that might feel uncomfortable for me but im never going to personally attack anybody although i may poke fun at a situation im never going to pass judgement
2932242 gemini division plays to the history of storytelling nbc is known for
2932243 the story really lent itself to creating an immersive environment beyond the show
2932244 he wont have that home court advantage of new york where people romanticize him
2932245 you can bet kuby will be there again standing up for his good friend
2932246 i wont get into an argument with curtis about this im not paid to do that anymore
2932247 in this technological age the queue is quite a tragedy
2932248 we buy water from here for its being both cheap and clean spring water are priced at ytl 4 5 to 5 5 on the market but it is brought to stations through water pipes from yamanlar mountain and a 20 liter gallon can be filled up just for ytl 1
2932249 when it comes to sport we will always remain friends and nothing will come between our friendship
2932250 if the world was to draw any lessons from what we do there wouldnt be any wars we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage wars
2932251 there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave it to the politicians to figure it out
2932252 weve been shooting together for a long time we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
2932253 last night the president called and told us we had better stay in beijing we couldnt sleep we were up until one or two oclock in the morning all we could think of was georgia
2932254 i dont want to support russia georgia or abkhazia but i think georgia is doing a stupid thing by making war during the olympic games
2932255 georgian people are very nice and very funny i think the problem is with the president of georgia and thats it only one man who is deciding everything for his country i have no problem with the people of georgia
2932256 we are going to play with more passion against all countries including russia
2932257 pepino originally grown in south america lives for eight to 10 years its a very soft plant and sensitive to handling our goal is to produce more pepinos in the region
2932258 pepino a well known fruit in the world but not popular in our region is an energy booster and good for health our goal is to expand the production area of pepino with the support given by the residents of the village and local governmental officials
2932259 ive heard that pepino includes the flavors of melon banana and pineapple pepino which is also edible like melon can also be used as a side dish with salad
2932260 it was brought to my attention even before deciding to move from istanbul that there is a need here in the expat community for someone of the christian faith who could help in times of spiritual need especially for those who have loved ones who become ill and are in the hospital and for those who lose loved ones in death
2932261 one was an irish family that had been here on holiday and the other an expat resident
2932262 my first visit to marmaris last december afforded me the opportunity to assist the christian community in the celebration of the birth of jesus so there is a need for someone to be present to be available to the expat community for those individuals who desire to receive such assistance and spiritual encouragement
2932263 i feel quite at ease in providing the ministry that i have been doing so far
2932264 it has been without difficulty or problems that could be interpreted as some sort of opposition to the presence of a christian community here i believe this is a credit to and a direct result of the local officials here and this wonderful community of people we cherish this tolerance as a rare and precious gift
2932265 these are purely social events which we are glad to host said bradley
2932266 after lunch is an opportunity for those that want to stay attend a bible study these classes are given in english and german
2932267 i dont see a need at present to do that after all i am still just settling in im sure the community will help define any such needs
2932268 until we do i certainly expect oil prices to remain at these elevated levels over 100 a barrel and eventually challenge their all time highs again and then surpass them in the coming year
2932269 m istagi on selleks kurjategijaks saaka vili seega on raske eeldada et venemaa peaks t naseid gruusia v ime nn legitiimseks partneriks

2932279 this way every company can be treated equally and on a uniform basis
2932280 its a new season and every year theres optimism at every camp across the country
2932281 were no different than anybody else were excited to get going and see where were at
2932282 the nice thing is weve got a lot i guess veteran kids now some older kids
2932283 well have at least 15 seniors on the squad which for us is the most weve ever had so were excited about just the age of the kids and the leadership that possibly could emerge from this group
2932284 but with the older kids were also going to try to stress being perfect they should know what were doing now
2932285 i think as most positions go that will determine itself
2932286 i feel good about all the fuels reduction work done in that corridor and you can see it in the protection of the structures on the north side
2932287 im thinking theyve done a good job in the heat of battle and im hopeful that its all going to come out ok im feeling pretty good that were positioned pretty well
2932288 we dont feel that even spotting over that has much if any probability
2932289 were going to be looking at actions to try to corral it up into the woods
2932290 it gets out on the grassy slopes where bucket work or retardant will work
2932291 the process of going from a green tree to a replacement tree after it dies can take a very long time
2932292 fire is the natural recycling mechanism for the forest instead of waiting 10 to 50 years for that process to potentially occur fire will consume the excess material left by the dead tree and scarify the area for a receptive seed bed to grow a new tree
2932293 not every tree dies there are survivors and those are the trees you want to stock the new forest with
2932294 the pine species will come through first but its going to be different on this fire because its a hot dry south facing aspect so it could take longer for new growth depending on future weather conditions
2932295 a lot of those have burned a little bit here and there but its not like the whole bottom is ripped and snorted
2932296 but there are positive benefits compared to the risk which is isolated mainly to the river corridor beetle infestation is taking out huge portions of the timber base fire needs to burn in this landscape
2932297 pro choice americans sent thousands of messages to senators calling on them to stop another anti choice bush nominee from getting lifetime employment at taxpayer expense
2932298 we will continue to monitor this nomination its positive that the honaker nomination hasnt moved forward but we wont take anything for granted
2932299 the spirit of that case is the right to privacy and i recognize the right to privacy
2932300 while some groups suggest that mr honaker is a one issue ideologue we can assure you that such is not the case
2932301 mr honaker will serve wyoming and our country with distinction and he deserves prompt consideration by the senate judiciary committee
2932302 we had to make adjustments we kind of got out of our game plan today
2932303 but you cant let that get to you you have to stay positive hope to go back the next inning and score again
2932304 you could see we were in trouble from the beginning
2932305 idaho falls starter bryan casey came out and did a good job he was able to mix his pitches and it looked like he had a good curveball working today thats mainly what got us in trouble
2932306 they know how to steal thats the strength of their club
2932307 its really disheartening to me to lose any structures particularly a place like that that has a lot of history
2932308 its their road and their bridges and they put no maintenance into either one since 1995 and prior to that they did insignificant amounts of maintenance
2932309 the forest service has not accepted the responsibility to provide access
2932310 had the erroneous view that the sweetwater could operate the lodge without bridge access on a permanent basis by using fords
2932311 the change of forest administration in 1996 brought forward active opposition to the use of funds for sweetwater bridge replacement which resulted in the rejection of available funds in 2000 and the bridge closure in 2001
2932312 although the road is not open as a public road reliable motorized access is needed by the forest service for maintenance at the lodge facility fire suppression and other resource management needs a road and motorized access may be needed in the future if the lodge facility is operated under a special use permit
2932313 there was lots of conversation about having it be a remote access facility it would be an adventure trip where you pack in on horses one individual was potentially interested in mountain bike access
2932314 thats the whole point we were making as a business youre not going to be able to get fire insurance for it who is going to invest in that
2932315 each decision the forest service has made and each action theyve taken has made it harder and harder for a business to survive
2932316 sticks like a big thumb for three miles up into the wilderness area
2932317 with no structures there it wouldnt be reauthorized as a lodge use
2932318 it would be open to the public its rough to cross and depends on the time of year
2932319 when for 100 000 they could have had two bridges
2932320 its a lot like doing your hair you just try to make them look better and bring out their best
2932321 it really helps to work with them when theyre calves
2932322 you work hard on your cattle and it all comes down to this and you get to show off what youve done
2932323 were having a very hard time recruiting and retaining teachers the pay is a major issue
2932324 there just isnt the pool out there to draw from
2932325 rural schools are going to be the last to get to fill their positions so in turn you get desperate and you need somebody you need a person to fill the class so you take the ding and try and make it work in a lot of instances you put a good person in there they just dont have the state certification
2932326 its very difficult to recruit teachers right now considering our funding structure
2932327 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2932328 while the fighting continues we expect the market to remain under pressure as investors seek safer opportunities
2932329 the armed conflict with georgia has damaged investor confidence and a drawn out war would likely fuel the debate about political risk
2932330 british representatives on the ground and the media have reported that russia has extended the fighting today well beyond south ossetia attacking the georgian port of poti and the town of gori while abkhaz forces have been shelling georgian positions in the upper kodori valley i deplore this
2932331 we serve them approximately 6 000 calories a day during the week they get three beef dinners two pork and two chicken but they really like the beef
2932332 a roll of the dice because you dont get paid for sitting around waiting only when youre feeding people
2932333 its a fun job and you do see a lot of the same people
2932334 it was nice being down there feeling like you were making a contribution the alligators were really interesting and here its bears theyre warning us about
2932335 thats the standard around the world the five minute rule
2932336 if you cant get your water to the point of attack and get back for another load in five minutes or less youll never win
2932337 and this fire the gunbarrel has a really good name that would make a great design
2932338 somebody just needs to make a bunch and bring them up here and theyd make a fortune
2932339 we believe a male has shot a female in the car park and he has then turned the firearm on himself
2932340 then i thought thats ridiculous this is an olympic games you have to go for it
2932341 jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
2932342 the last 10 to 15 metres were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
2932343 i didnt go in planning to break the world record im very excited it was a great swim she said
2932344 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
2932345 there were several attacks on the kodori gorge all of them repelled
2932346 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2932347 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2932348 in certain zones near tskhinvali russian peacekeepers met active confrontation
2932349 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides
2932350 fast ppi growth suggests strong inflationary pressures remain upstream as a result it is difficult for the government to loosen policy more aggressively
2932351 we see it exerting more pressure on profit margins than cpi
2932352 as long as overcapacity exists in chinas consumer related manufacturing sectors and we expect the overcapacity to be increasingly exposed as chinese exports continue to weaken firms will have difficulty passing on rising production costs to consumers
2932353 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2932354 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2932355 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2932356 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2932357 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2932358 you could probably have been forgiven for expecting the aussie to trade slightly better but its probably more down to what the euro does and what the us dollar does at least in the short term
2932359 it does seem to be the case that the market has really moved on from watching us factors to watching european events and european data
2932360 traders are more concerned about the fact that the more negative european data that weve had out risks that we see more to come and the fact that the escalation in violence is very close to europes backyard
2932361 it poured some cold water on the notion that they might start with some aggressive moves and really slash rates
2932362 they will cut rates in september probably by 25 basis points
2932363 they probably dont envisage to do a lot of cuts at this stage
2932364 all wins are important but i suppose since the origin series weve been labouring a little bit at some stages in some games
2932365 we think theres some areas of our game we can improve and well have to improve but there were some good signs to be able to play 80 minutes at that intensity against manly even though we probably didnt execute it as well as wed like
2932366 just from that game the other night i think we can improve with our attack
2932367 the origin series takes a lot out of some guys physically and takes a lot out of some guys mentally so even during and after the origin series theres usually some signs there that weve had nine or 10 players who havent been at their best
2932368 we havent been at our best but theyve still found a way to win most of those games
2932369 a lot of its mental especially this time of the year but were sort of concentrating a little bit more on our physical stuff at the moment because we gave the origin players a whole heap of rest
2932370 were probably trying to build that up a little bit at the moment so thats one of our focuses
2932371 we think theyre fresh enough now for us to lift their training load and hopefully that will help us as well
2932372 theres probably a couple there that might be a little bit of a concern for this week they didnt train today
2932373 i dont think its going to stop them playing but at the end of the day it restricts their preparation
2932374 knee and body are fine i pulled up ok after the game on the weekend so hopefully i can get through training this week
2932375 im very comfortable its probably the best ive felt game wise and each week is getting better so i cant wait to get out there soon
2932376 ive been told theres no more things i can do to my knee its not going to get any worse
2932377 the only main thing is to make sure i get my hammies and quadies right
2932378 if i run out there and tear a hammy or quady i miss a couple of weeks anyway so if i get that strengthened up ill be fine and ive been doing that for the last eight weeks and its getting better each week
2932379 im squatting heavier each time i do it so its a positive sign
2932380 and every time i get out and train im running a bit faster and kicking a bit better on the left its getting better and better each time
2932381 georgian military detachments are completely cornered in the upper part of the kodori gorge in abkhazia
2932382 more than 50 russian warplanes are flying over georgia tbilisi was bombed bombs hit the village of kojori and makhata mountain
2932383 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals

2932386 the energy sector was another big dampener on the market due to another four per cent fall in the price of oil on friday
2932387 oil rose a bit today but that hasnt come across much
2932388 gold stocks in particular were heavily sold off after a 1 5 per cent fall in the gold price

2932405 what we now see in the smoking ruins of the 2005 bankruptcy reform law is a colossal failure twice over the gao study shows that the law sharply increased the costs of bankruptcy further bankruptcy numbers have been rising steadily since 2006 with the current situation being one in which all too many americans suffering through the home mortgage crisis find themselves stripped of key protections that congress removed in 2005 it is hard to imagine how the 2005 law could have been engineered to do more harm to consumers than we now know to be the case
2932406 bankruptcy reform dollar costs associated with the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005
2932407 based on a random sample of bankruptcy files gao estimated that the average attorney fee for a chapter 7 case increased from 712 in february march 2005 to 1 078 in february march 2007 for chapter 13 cases in more than half the cases the increase was 55 percent or more as a result of the act and subsequent budget legislation total bankruptcy filing fees have risen from 209 to 299 for a chapter 7 and from 194 to 274 for a chapter 13 in addition fees to meet the acts credit counseling and debtor education requirements are typically about 100

2932410 children play with these objects they are made to feel as though computers are something that might love them that they might love that they need to nurture that might nurture them how are we going to feel when our computers are relating to us at that level do we want that how is that going to change our views of ourselves and of our relationship with the world around us thats what interests me now

2932429 as far and away the most important customer for any publishing company in this country
2932430 not an integrated company but a globally co ordinated one that is the trick that we try to get right this loose tight solution
2932431 on the one hand we try to take advantage of the resources of the global organization the penguin brand but the local application of those assets is absolutely down to whoever the publisher is in the particular market
2932432 and commercial non fiction publishing was what we became known for
2932433 we want to reassert penguins claim as a publisher of literary fiction
2932434 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2932435 i cant believe they would be so stupid its just provocative
2932436 but maybe their intention is to get rid of all the former liberal governments tomorrow starts today programs
2932437 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
2932438 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding
2932439 would we not love to get that from our stock portfolios if these cuts will save the countrys economy god help us were in worse shape than i ever thought

2932443 all historical references fit together and make tecumsehs role a believable story
2932444 what else could tecumseh give brock as a gift theres nothing else that would be important but without being there you cant prove it

2932450 in this case as in many others the company responsible has skipped out of town without paying much of anything and left taxpayers paying

2932459 we were at a point where there were questions about some of the payments and some of the contractors were getting concerned as to whether or not they would get paid
2932460 were willing to make the payment but we dont know where
2932461 it became obvious it was time to separate theres really no big dark secret it was just time
2932462 sometimes doors open for you and sometimes you need to kick them in
2932463 we make the most of each day and always hope for tomorrow
2932464 i was pretty confident that we would break the record but we went above and beyond my expectation
2932465 its great to see the community around an event that broke the world record
2932466 to be part of an olympic team is to go beyond the competition
2932467 you are very proud of representing your country being part of a city learning about other cultures

2932546 i dont think any woman wants to gain weight anywhere but her belly and her boobs

2932571 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2932572 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2932573 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2932574 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2932575 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2932591 youve got to give gifts to get anything done these days when zhou dixuan and chen aimin get out theyll settle your hash
2932592 the diary is out there and zhou dixuan has been arrested but apart from zhou and his wife theres been no legal proceedings brought against anyone else and zhou himself might not be charged with bribery
2932593 we wanted to restart normal company operations here but now it looks like thats impossible
2932594 xianglian had more than 300 outlets bringing in annual profits of more than 2 million losses are serious now that things have stopped
2932595 get together twenty or thirty thousand and ill help you get a wholesaler license
2932596 but zhou dixuan said that chen aimin had to have rmb 20 000 more than the two of us or else we could forget about the company
2932597 at first he didnt know that you could make so much money in this business but then he asked around and discovered that it really had a good future if business was good then it wouldnt be unusual to make 10 000 a day there was lots of room for profit so he changed
2932598 chen aimin was the companys legal representative and her husband zhou dixuan was the companys legal consultant who also was deeply involved in company operations their daughter zhou hong was nominally the company accountant but in actuality it was chen aimin who handled the accounting her skills were limited leading to frequent errors and omissions this caused the companys operations and financial affairs to be joined into one monolithic entity whose management was imperfect and only nominal under internal control
2932599 i knew right away that the company was a mess but it really did have a bright future
2932600 zhou jianming youre an entrepreneurial whiz who can take this company red hot when you join up the company will be run according to your ideas under digital control
2932601 the real length of my contract was less than 20 days which were all profitable
2932602 but this was just something to make the scam go down easier
2932603 to get me out earlier so i could spend the holiday with my family zhou dixuan and chen aimin took rmb 40 000 from me to pull some strings
2932604 contractors may work together to build relationships with administrative departments all such expenses are the responsibility of contractors themselves
2932605 after spending so much time with the kids in the kindergarten hes an honest man he always felt that if he put his heart into making those payments hed be able to win over zhou dixuan and his wife
2932606 its all because i wanted too much to make the company better but there are too many time bombs buried in it otherwise i wouldnt in the straits i am now
2932607 you cant take this theyre suing us and if you take these receipts youll be sorry youre guilty of sending gifts too
2932608 no bring the rest of them with you tomorrow and ill give you a real receipt for them all
2932609 zhou jianming never listens let me take care of him
2932610 it was important to stay alive so i didnt want the bag any more i ran down the stairs and heard zhou dixuan shout sanyazi if that schemer tries to make any trouble i want you to kill him
2932611 the tax business administration and public security bureaus sent core members to take part in the case so the number of participants was actually more than just twenty
2932612 its been many years since weve seen so many provincial and municipal leaders paying such close attention to a single case though the amount of money involved isnt all that much it could have an extremely harmful influence
2932613 youve got to give gifts to get anything done these days when zhou dixuan and chen aimin get out theyll settle your hash
2932614 its obvious that this is revenge lots of people are intentionally making things difficult and whenever i look them up they treat me like the god of pestilence and avoid me true they no longer take our gifts but its still difficult to get anything done
2932615 thats what society is like these days its impossible to avoid sending gifts

2932882 dari irbadh bin sariyah ia berkata rasulullah memimpin salat subuh kemudian ia menasehati kami dengan nasehat yang sangat indah sehingga berlinang air mata kami dan bergetar hati kami seseorang berkata ya rasulullah seakan akan ini nasehat terakhir berilah kami wasiat lalu ia bersabda aku wasiatkan kamu untuk bertakwa kepada allah dan untuk mendengar dan menaati pemimpin kamu walaupun ia budah dari habsyi siapa diantara kalian yang hidup sepeninggalku akan melihat ikhtilaf yang banyak sekali hendaklah kalian berpegang kepada sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa al rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk berpeganglah kepadanya erat erat
2932883 azan awal hari jumat diperintahkan oleh amirul mukminin utsman bin affan yang ketiga dari al khulafa al rasyidin nabi bersabda ikutilah sunnahku dan sunnah al khulafa al rasyidin
2932884 tidakkah engkau lihat bahwa para sahabat sudah ijmak pada tindakan umar yang menghimpun orang untuk salat tarawih berjamaa yang dipimpin imam dengan 20 rakaat dan ucapan umar bidah yang paling baik ini semuanya itu benar dari umar dan para sahabat tidakkah kau perhatikan bahwa orang yang menganggap umar sesat karena sebab itu yakni karena membaut bidah salat tarawih jr sudah masuk dalam lingkungan kesesatan umar termasuk al khulafa al rasyidin al mahdiyyin yang kita diperintahkan untuk meneladaninya dan mengikuti petunjuknya
2932885 berpendapat tentang takhshish kitab allah dengan amal shahabi karena shahabat yang berilmu tidak akan meninggalkan amal dalam keumuman al kitab kecuali dengan dalil amalnya yang bertentangan dengan umum nya al kitab menjadi dalil tentang takhshish dan dengan begitu amalnya mendapat pahala
2932886 siapa yang menyertai rasul allah saw atau pernah melihatnya dari kalangan muslim ia termasuk shahabatnya
2932887 yang paling benar menurutku ialah bahwa shahabat adalah orang yang berjumpa dengan nabi saaw yang sambil beriman kepadanya dan meninggal dalam keadaan islam
2932888 sepakat ahlu sunnah bahwa semua sahabat udul tidak ada yang membantahnya kecuali orang orang yang menyimpang dari kelompok ahli bidah
2932889 menurut pendapat salaf dan jumhur khalaf adalah shahabat itu diterima karena allah pun menjadikannya adil bi tadilihim iyyahum dan memujinya dalam kitab nya kecuali yang benar benar jelas kefasikannya dan ia sadari untuk yang tidak jelas untuk tidak diperlukan tadil allah swt berfirman kamulah umat yang paling baik yang dikeluarkan ditengah tengah manusia kemudian al ghazali mengutip ayat ayat dan sunnah tentang keadilan sahabat sekiranya tidak ada nash dan sunnah tentang keadilan mereka keadaan mereka hijrah jihad berkorban memerangi orang tua dan keluarga demi membela dan menolong rasulullah cukuplah sebagai argumen tentang keadilan mereka mereka semua mujtahid atas apapun yang mereka lakukan yang benar mendapat pahala yang salah dimaafkan
2932890 sekalipun jumhur berpendapat bahwa sahabat semua udul tidak boleh dikenakan kepadanya al jarh wa tadil sebagaimana dikenakan pada perawi yang lainnya dan menganggapnya maksum dari segala kesalahan dan lupa ada banyak peneliti yang tidak menerima keadilan mutlak bagi semua sahabat mereka berkata seperti al muqbili yang adil itu kebanyakan bukan semuanya mungkin terjadi pada mereka apa yang mungkin terjadi pada yang lain yang memang lahir dari tabiat manusiawi apa yang terjadi pada zaman nabi saw seperti orang munafik dan para pembohong dan apa yang terjadi sesudahnya berupa perang kerusuhan fitnah permusuhan yang dampaknya terus menerus sampai zaman kita sekarang dan akan terus berlanjut sampai zaman yang akan datang
2932891 mereka bersumpah kepada kamu dengan sumpah palsu hanya supaya kamu senang kepada mereka
2932892 janganlah kamu mengatakan kepada orang yang mengucapkan salam kepadamu kamu bukan muslim
2932893 sungguh aku telah mendapat sedikit dari kebaikan duniaku dan menimbulkan kerusakan yang banyak pada agamaku sekiranya aku perbaiki itu apa yang aku rusak dan sekiranya yang rusak itu aku perbaiki pastilah aku orang yang beruntung sekiranya ada gunanya untuk meminta aku akan meminta sekiranya aku dapat selamat dengan berlari aku akan berlari

2932901 due to the serious allegations that have been raised regarding cuppys failure to honor various contractual commitments
2932902 in that the aafd board of directors next meeting is set for september 4 2008 i am acting to immediately to suspend cuppys accredited contract status pending action of the aafd board i am causing this action to be published on the aafd website and to appropriate media all listings of cuppys coffee will forthwith be removed from the aafd website and we are instructing cuppys management to remove all references to the aafd from its website and franchise marketing literature
2932903 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
2932904 the path to a successful resolution of the cuppys quagmire is through communication negotiation collaboration and if necessary mediation the path to certain destruction is to ignore the problem and face an inevitable and costly litigative path

2932951 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2932952 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2932953 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2932954 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2932955 now the whole world knows so i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2932956 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2932957 i was pretty shocked when i heard about it because theres a lot of people that we know on that bus
2932958 so im thinking that could have been us and it made me realize that life is really short and precious and you never know when you know it might can happen to you
2932959 this has no relationship to nor does it involve john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my child
2932960 i want to pass all the skills i have to the young members of my staff so that when they decide to pursue other posts within this profession they will be fully equipped
2932961 i would like to see everybody perfect in what they specialise in and be able to alternate from one speciality to another
2932962 i think that through the college i will be able to transfer the skills and knowledge that i have gained throughout my years in this profession
2932963 she is everything a mother is and can be accommodative both professionally and personally
2932964 i have learned everything about primary health care from hiv treatment to antenatal care and from family planning to pregnancy management basically i have learned comprehensive health care and i even have management skills
2932965 living a christian life has taught me one lesson to serve gods people to the fullest
2932966 some of our patients come to the clinic late verbally abuse my staff and still demand service some even use fake addresses and we cant trace them for follow up check ups we also have a staff shortfall
2932967 you have to be flexible in this kind of a situation and be very accommodating of all types of people
2932968 everybody has to be involved in this quest we have to strategically tailor this service to work better for the community that we serve
2932969 i visit the clinic mainly when i have flu and presently i come for antenatal care
2932970 however i think they should increase their facilities so that everyone can be accommodated
2932971 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
2932972 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2932973 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2932974 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2932975 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2932976 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
2932977 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
2932978 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2932979 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
2932980 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
2932981 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2932982 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2932983 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2932984 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2932985 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2932986 i wore a loose fitting t shirt yesterday i was very hot in london yesterday and its no secret i dont like wearing bras besides i dont need to measuring in at 32a it hardly seems necessary
2932987 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently
2932988 its actually incredibly embarrassing and lonely when im walking down the street and men are chasing me with their cameras drawing attention to me and people then pointing and taking out their cameras and phones all getting in on the action
2932989 anyway my point is i would never use my body in that way im just not that kind of girl
2932990 cheryls been through a very tough time so i went to her dressing room on the first day of filming to introduce myself and wish her luck
2932991 its true that girls aloud have said some unfortunate things about me but you cant hold on to things like that
2932992 the drug thing is something i cant go into for legal reasons but i will say that it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed
2932993 i had a bad experience it was nowhere near an overdose
2932994 i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs
2932995 its something that everyone well not everyone smart people usually dont do it but its something that people go through in their lives especially growing up in london and its not something ive ever had a problem with
2932996 im not friends with amy winehouse i dont live in camden ive never smoked crack in my life ive done other drugs
2932997 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2932998 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2932999 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2933000 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please

2933026 lets rachet up the tension go full tilt and slam the foot on the gas
2933027 lets do it what do we got to work with
2933028 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2933029 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2933030 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2933031 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2933032 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2933033 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2933034 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2933035 the mood of the country is very sour about the current administration people dont like the party as much as they did four years ago
2933036 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2933037 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2933038 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2933039 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2933040 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2933041 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2933042 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2933043 the national western stock show isnt partisan it doesnt take sides
2933044 its an opportunity to bring people of all different backgrounds culture races together thats what the west is really about
2933045 okay so when you look at the chart and see a bad dr do you tell the patients that theyve got a dog
2933046 if i had to choose i would rather have birds than airplanes
2933047 this is where i could write a novel the mountains of costa rica are beautiful and offer a 10 to 15f degree lower temperature than on the coast the cooler air and lower humidity in the mountains are often preferred when living in the tropics all the land is deeded and is usually a lot less expensive than on the coast
2933048 i dont see my family much my family is the company
2933049 i cant decide which is more pathetic the way these men approach their roles as parents or the way that fortune magazine writes about it without any commentary
2933050 if you are poor and abandon your children you are a bad parent but if you are rich and you abandon them to run a company you are profiled in fortune magazine
2933051 im only 36 why would you assume ive decided never to have children
2933052 im kind of leaning towards obama but hes a rookie you know and im kind of worried about that
2933053 hillary said shes the candidate for people who need a president
2933054 in other words people who dont need a president can afford to vote for obama because hes exciting represents change etc
2933055 the mother that had to cut back on groceries because of rising gas prices the guy i met who couldnt fill up his gas tank to go on a job search
2933056 obama could use a little more empathy and a little less lecture
2933057 im hoping obama would be a better steward of the economy but im undecided
2933058 i dont like mccain mccain is bush and weve already had this one you know what i mean
2933059 base are independent leaning voters concerned by overspending in washington
2933060 obama can battle mccain in appealing to those kind of voters very well
2933061 mccain hes be a good military leader but i dont know as far as running the economy
2933062 its hard to say at this point whod handle the economy better
2933063 we need change so whoevers going to make the biggest change
2933064 it appears the way the numbers have fallen short means that the country liberals with the support of territorians have done exceptionally well but have fallen short
2933065 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
2933066 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2933067 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there

2933070 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
2933071 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it

2933076 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2933077 thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2933078 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2933079 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2933080 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2933081 for a normal healthy pregnancy the hospital environment is overkill
2933082 interventions that neither the mother nor father wish to occur are more likely when surrounded by people who view pregnancy as an illness or labor as inherently dangerous
2933083 i consider birth sacred and a joy and i intend to birth my baby in a way that reflects that
2933084 legislating against home birth is totally un american and unfair
2933085 we rank 42nd in the world in live births and we spend more money than anyone else you cant blame it on home birth
2933086 unless theres ready access to certain emergency personnel and equipment and even surgery youre potentially endangering babies and moms health and lives
2933087 weve all seen scenarios where mothers came in after very major blood loss in a very catastrophic state
2933088 by the time they arrive in the hospital youre sort of behind the eight ball in trying to resuscitate these patients the same thing with neonatal outcome
2933089 i identified myself and the chaps reaction was what on earth do you think ive done
2933090 the numbers there are just overwhelming just an astounding number of people theyre trying to keep track of
2933091 the met is absolutely brilliant at the big set pieces
2933092 if you cant trust the police in times of crisis then who can you turn to
2933093 the metropolitan police has always struck me as iconic of english society
2933094 it merges absolute professionalism discipline and hard careful work with a kind of organization that creates disorganization services arent sufficiently interconnected
2933095 our disadvantage is that weve got twice the geographic area and weve got some other functions as well were a combination of the nypd and part of the u s secret service and part of the fbi
2933096 it sometimes can be detrimental to some of our responses when we work within these portfolios
2933097 terrorists are actually engaged in serious criminality as well so there is that crossover that takes place and theres often debate around which unit is responsible
2933098 the police need to remain focused on what theyre supposed to be there for which is about making london safer
2933099 twenty per cent of our last academy class was foreign born
2933100 scotland yard is pretty much still lily white they have a different reputation within the population as a result
2933101 we have independent advisers who are community representatives jewish turkish black faith lesbian gay bisexual transgender
2933102 policing is like being on a river bank next to a fast flowing stream
2933103 you have the choice of pulling them out of the water or going upstream to find out whos throwing them in theres a lot of debate about where is the limit of the police mandate because we could go very far upstream
2933104 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2933105 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2933106 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2933107 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2933108 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2933109 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2933110 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2933111 theme parties fund raising galas social activities abound in escazu costa ricas beverly hills
2933112 he has turned pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2933113 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2933114 ha sido el colof n a un ciclo fant stico
2933115 troops had killed 60 ltte terrorists and 28 were wounded from sundays confrontations
2933116 the death injuries and loss due to this attack typical when sri lanka air force bombs a heavily populated area in vanni have been repeated more than one hundred times over the vanni area over a period of two years

2933118 they were killing people chopping them down and burning the houses and the shops i am afraid to go back to school i want to go back maybe someone here can help me
2933119 we have identified the priorities on long term development targets with the focus on 100 indonesian people living under 2 u s dollars per day
2933120 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2933121 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2933122 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2933123 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2933124 it is very sinister when we hear that they the kalenjin are sending their women and children away
2933125 when the election result was questioned my kalenjin neighbours came to us and killed my husband the burnt down our house
2933126 they said go and dont come back let your great man kibaki take care of you now
2933127 houses were burning people were fighting people were killing the women were crying
2933128 tell the newspapers we want peace we dont want corruption corruption makes us poor
2933129 i am now an orphan from kibera i ended up here after my luo neighbours drove me out of my single room home owned by a kikuyu and then threw petrol over it life here is difficult with other kikuyu and luos is very difficult the people call each other names i think they hate us all i have in the world now is the clothes im wearing and a single blanket which is for lying on and covering yourself too i dont know when this this will end i just want my life back
2933130 my mother tells me i cannot go home because it is not safe i want to go to school where they give us food
2933131 as soon as the election results was announced they the kalenjin
2933132 they were killing people i dont know how many i could hear my neighbours screaming then the silence then more screaming
2933133 its tribal jealousy they burnt all our schools they have killed our homes and our businesses
2933134 my father is in hospital he is fighting to live they came into his shop and stole everything and then set it on fire he was cut up in the head with pangas and left for dead with the shop assistant he died
2933135 things look really bad it doesnt look good at all
2933136 it passed so quickly that i wished to go again because it was so much fun
2933137 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader mr mills said
2933138 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2933139 i was quietly confident that if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you and i was always confident of that mr mills said
2933140 i believe that the result that has been achieved is an endorsement for that kind of politics
2933141 i think gary has done an outstanding job and would have made a significant contribution
2933142 we have certainly improved our position in fannie bay i am more confident of holding fannie bay mr henderson told reporters outside parliament house
2933143 there is still quite a large number of postal votes out there so its not impossible there will be a change but i am much more confident that we will hold the seat
2933144 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader mr mills said
2933145 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short

2933153 since friday we have yet to see the pull out that was agreed upon by the milf
2933154 what is highly irregular is the fact that these contentious barangays whose residents were driven from their homes and farmlands are not even part of the proposed bangsamoro juridical entity that is the subject of ongoing negotiations
2933155 thus widening the scope of the conflict and causing more civilians to evacuate
2933156 rasmussen is the most handsome prime minister in europe i think i will introduce him to my wife because he is even more handsome than cacciari

2933159 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2933160 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
2933161 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
2933162 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
2933163 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
2933164 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
2933165 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
2933166 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
2933167 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
2933168 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
2933169 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
2933170 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
2933171 de groei wordt vooral gerealiseerd bij jongeren en oudere mensen
2933172 de belangrijkste verklaring voor de stijging is dat steeds meer mensen gaan shoppen op de gsm markt ze volgen de aanbiedingen van de operatoren nauwkeurig en gaan zowel een simkaart nemen bij degene die gratis smsjes aanbiedt als bij degene die gratis belminuten geeft

2933340 prima di scegliere un appartamento guardo i vasi sul balcone i fiori ti dicono tutto sul conto corrente di chi ci vive
2933341 quando sei in strada devi studiare la vittima vedere come vestita seguirla e scoprire dove abita in casa sua per esempio non entrer mai
2933342 portare tutto in una cassetta di sicurezza in banca l noi non entriamo
2933343 uno fa il palo un altro di supporto e guida la macchina e quello con le palle entra e fa il lavoro sporco
2933344 noi leggiamo sempre la cronaca nera e se un furto in un quartiere ha avuto molto risalto sui giornali per un po abbandoniamo quella zona perch chi ci abita alza la guardia

2933347 abbiamo adottato un metodo in uso in altri paesi intendiamo aprire una consultazione pubblica durer tre mesi su unipotesi di scenario accompagnata da molti interrogativi vogliamo che vi partecipino in molti nel parlamento e nella societ pensiamo che il ridisegno del modello sociale sia parte della costituzione materiale del paese non quindi una consultazione dettata da generica propensione bipartisan ma la convinzione che il punto di arrivo i valori debbono essere largamente condivisi nel gergo della commissione europea il libro bianco invece un prodotto compiuto pi che domande contiene risposte ancora a valle poi come governo predisporremo le riforme legislative per transitare dallattuale al futuro sistema di welfare
2933348 il macrolane nasce come versione per il corpo dellacido ialuronico che da anni gi ampiamente utilizzato per il viso infatti pi denso di restylane e perlane ed prodotto dallazienda svedese che unica in america ha ottenuto lautorizzazione dalla severa fda
2933349 biosintetico non di origine animale ed ottimo per il ripristino di volumi persi e per il bodyshaping cio il rimodellamento del corpo
2933350 in questo caso meglio aspettare prima di gridare al miracolo nel mondo la sperimentazione sul corpo del macrolane ha solo cinque anni in italia luso stato autorizzato lo scorso settembre per il corpo pochi mesi dopo anche per il seno la casistica di cui disponiamo ancora troppo bassa per valutare se si tratta di un impianto sicuro lunico studio serio conosciuto e pubblicato dal giapponese inami handa sul journal of plastic surgery americano riguarda 1 100 casi tutti giapponesi perch questa tecnica piace moltissimo in un paese in cui le donne sono minute e hanno poco seno una misura in pi su di loro un cambiamento eclatante
2933351 anche perch non affatto vero che si esegue in cos poco tempo non sempre basta lanestesia locale spesso bisogna anche sedare la paziente e quindi necessaria la presenza di un anestesista spaventata da un ago decisamente ragguardevole che penetra sottocute
2933352 non solo per effettuare pi punture e distribuire bene vari cc di gel possono bastare 30 40 minuti il recupero per richiede vari giorni ma la vera controindicazione che da chirurgo e da donna mi sento di dover sottolineare che nel seno andrebbero utilizzate solo sostanze ben delimitate come le protesi che nel caso sia necessario possano essere tolte come corpo unico perch non bisogna dimenticare che il seno pu anche essere colpito da tumori

2933360 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2933361 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2933362 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2933363 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2933364 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2933365 we believe a male has shot a female in the car park and he has then turned the firearm on himself
2933366 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2933376 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2933377 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2933378 he was a dc in manchester in the early seventies
2933379 and i was pretty sure his reaction would be i can see why youve pushed gene hunt into a sort of caricature for dramatic effect but of course it wasnt really like that
2933380 my response to that was no it isnt over the top at all in fact if anything its rather toned down by comparison with real life all these things happened they just didnt all happen in one hour
2933381 i think gene hunt is very typical of cid before the mid 1980s when a variety of reforms kicked in slowly but which transformed the whole world of criminal investigation and the way suspects are handled but as a portrayal of detectives before that its as accurate as you can get in drama
2933382 i knew some of the detective chief inspectors who were so tough that they would have regarded a gene hunt character as being a 22 carat nancy boy
2933383 there are many aspects of the programme life on mars and certainly revolving around police tactics that absolutely ring true
2933384 the officers who did that kind of thing were almost considered pariahs by other officers who didnt
2933385 it wasnt so much a case of it being against the law of it being illegal which of course it was those officers were generally seen to be buffoons the ones who couldnt do the job properly
2933386 there was a lot of pressure on the detectives then to get a person to admit to being guilty of a criminal offence because if that detective didnt get an admission it was almost as if hed failed and wasnt up to the job
2933387 in some cases and i would stress this is a few cases now that would lead to violence i know of that i never witnessed it personally but i know it went on but those were relatively rare cases
2933388 a copper leaps to a conclusion and then finds the evidence to fit
2933389 the life on mars programme portrays the police exactly as they were in fact it doesnt go far enough in respect of the brutality and the violence
2933390 we decided that gene wasnt an overt racist but that he was racially lazy so that he would just generalise about people
2933391 you argue were getting away with it but are you getting away with it if you show hanging drawing and quartering in an elizabethan drama were not actually advocating any of this were saying this is a period piece
2933392 and that was the interesting thing i think about approaching life on mars its only 35 years ago but it is a period drama
2933393 were offering up to 2 000 for information on his whereabouts
2933394 als je geen tijd hebt voor je passie is het dan wel je passie
2933395 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2933396 the refusal of submission to the roman pontiff or of communion with the members of the church subject to him
2933397 you are in danger of losing the eternal salvation of your soul jeopardizing the salvation of other innocent faithful and inflicting a most severe wound to the communion of the roman catholic church
2933398 i thought the outcome of the court meeting last week was that everyone was going to play nice and that the archdiocese would allow this election to go on
2933399 then they come like a thief in the night and deliver this letter threatening excommunication that doesnt sound to me like the archdiocese is playing nice
2933400 but then i realized this is a struggle thats been going on for a while and i feel that now im really a part of it
2933401 excludes the offender from taking part in the eucharist or other sacraments and from the exercise of any ecclesiastical office ministry or function
2933402 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
2933403 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2933404 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2933405 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2933406 books with the name of god written in them especially those written with the purpose of studying the scriptures and for prayer have a sacred nature to them
2933407 we want to honor the role these books played in helping people connect with god and judaism
2933408 we came because this is not a ceremony that happens very often and we wanted to pay our respects
2933409 its a sacred book and i thought it would be more respectful to come and bury it than to throw it away
2933410 within four to five years if we dug again in the same spot we wouldnt find any of them
2933411 we now prepare to lay within the earth these sacred texts that have taught us guided us and moved us closer to our people and closer to god
2933412 what we lay within the earth is ultimately only paper and ink the learning and inspiration we have derived from them will stay with us for all time
2933413 when you play harmonica you have to inhale and exhale as you pull your lungs downward it opens up the air sacs and the supply of oxygen to the body and the brain multiply
2933414 people say when you create music and listen to it it helps you emotionally
2933415 the harmonica is even better for patients because its easier to carry than other instruments
2933416 i had been working on this already but that accident kind of pushed me to go ahead and get it done
2933417 a lot of people have speculated that but its still being determined and its an ongoing investigation
2933418 now in town and country we have to avoid luxury car drivers swerving across centerlines while talking on the phone and all the deer its getting tough to drive out here
2933419 i think that while instinctively it has a great deal of merit it ought to be considered as well as on the state level to make sure we have a uniform set of laws rather than varying ordinances across municipal boundaries that might actually cause greater hazards
2933420 we support any legislation that promotes safety and saves lives on all the highways in missouri
2933421 maybe we will get lucky and have this pass and other cities will do the same and finally the statehouse will pass similar legislation that is my hope

2933432 we look forward to working together closely with his experimental team as this exciting project goes forward over the next five years
2933433 we invite computational theorists and scanning probe experimentalists in the nanoscience community to join our collaboration
2933434 theres lots of interesting work to do the first important steps toward practical realization are now underway
2933435 in coming months we expect to see signs of a widespread slowdown in the electronics sector which would directly impact semiconductor sales
2933436 as the economic cycle unfolds it seems inconceivable that we will not see a more significant reduction in spending on electronics even in the most resilient of industry sectors and regional markets

2933532 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders
2933533 they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty
2933534 i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain
2933535 this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009

2933578 over the christmas new year period and through the spring and summer of 2009 may decide to book with other carriers to avoid any possible interruptions in their holiday schedules as a result i find as a fact that the buttons will harm the employers relationship with its customers
2933579 the right to freedom of expression and participation in the lawful union activities is not an absolute one
2933580 employees owe a duty of loyalty to their employers wearing buttons at work which a carry a message detrimental to the employers economic interests is a breach of duty of loyalty
2933581 the buttons may be worn by employees so long as they remain in an area to which the public has no access to this extent the grievance is allowed
2933582 my impression is that all of these different agencies are treating this like a hot potato trying to pass it to the next agency and saying that they themselves are blameless
2933583 with hindsight there are probably many things that could or should have been done to avoid this crisis
2933584 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2933585 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint
2933586 that introduced huge amounts of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere and subsequently us
2933587 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2933588 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2933589 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2933590 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2933591 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2933592 i dont know if you could tell but we didnt have that same look in us going out to the floor
2933593 we had some tension finishing up so that was a tiny bit of disturbance
2933594 the injury took us all by surprise and we were all freaked out
2933595 its always hard going into something knowing one of your teammates is injured and cant help you out but we knew we had to even fight harder for it
2933596 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor

2933601 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2933602 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be

2933605 the ontario competition has accelerated for the feds the whole question of what they are going to do with aecl and the acr1000 reactor
2933606 this is not just about selling a reactor in canada its critical to aecls plans to compete in the world
2933607 the feds will blame the province and the province will say we heeded the advice of outside experts
2933608 ill pay for alec baldwins ticket out of the country
2933609 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was shortlisted
2933610 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2933611 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2933612 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2933613 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2933614 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2933615 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2933616 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2933617 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2933618 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2933619 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2933620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2933621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2933622 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2933623 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2933624 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2933643 yes sir i understand that some people might not have an easy time with technology however when a customer brings us an empty cartridge to refill we assume that since theyve been using it for however long they know that the gold part has always been on it have a nice day sir

2933741 you people have brought so much advancement to the country sir today everything is getting computerized
2933742 you sit in an office and write something on a computer and it does so many big things outside
2933743 it is not as simple as that my friend it is not just a question of writing a few lines there is a lot of process that goes behind it
2933744 it has to be no wonder you people are so highly paid
2933745 everyone just sees the money no one sees the amount of hard work we have to put in indians have such a narrow concept of hard work just because we sit in an air conditioned office does not mean our brows do not sweat you exercise the muscle we exercise the mind and believe me that is no less taxing
2933746 let me give you an example take this train the entire railway reservation system is computerized you can book a train ticket between any two stations from any of the hundreds of computerized booking centres across the country thousands of transactions accessing a single database at a time concurrently data integrity locking data security do you understand the complexity in designing and coding such a system

2933751 he was killed as he shielded and brought that injured soldier into the bunker every morning thereafter as we stood guard i could see him taking all those bullets which were actually meant for me i know sir i know what it is to be in the line of fire

2933782 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2933783 but it was kind of funny to see him over there running a lap he knew it was going to happen at some point i think it was a penalty lap but the fans turned it into a victory lap
2933784 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2933785 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2933786 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different

2933849 i just want the rockets to stop for good so that we dont have to live for these little moments of quiet that are followed by terrible barrages of qassams
2933850 the cease fire is giving families especially parents and kids a chance to breathe a little
2933851 this is not a real calm however because we know the rocket fire will resume soon
2933852 most people anticipate another heavy round of rocket fire based on what happened in the last cease fire
2933853 just governments must sometimes take the lives of unrepentant terrorist mass murderers in order to protect and uphold the infinite value of human life

2933888 he came one sabbath to the church of tongue on a day of drift and snow during the ministry of old mr william a distance of about sixteen miles and there was no road at that time after the close of the service the minister asked him why had ventured out on such a stormy day when only people in the near neighbourhood were at the service in reply he stated that there were three things that moved him to attend the house of god 1st the lord had given him strength and he considered it his duty to wait on him in public worship 2nd he came to add to the number in the congregation and thus encourage the minister when he knew that many would absent themselves 3rd he came so that if the spirit of god should be moving in the church that day he might not find his pew empty

2933941 some tvs need an upgrade to get digital you could even lose your signal get the facts
2933942 people who will need converters need to be encouraged to act sooner rather than later
2933943 retailers wont be able to handle a rush for boxes at the last minute and once a household applies for and receives a maximum of two coupons no more can be issued even if the original coupons expire
2933944 the digital signal provides a better picture and gives broadcasters the option of providing extra channels
2933945 unfortunately some of the people who use antennas may be the least capable of getting through the process
2933946 a station will either come in great with a wonderful picture or not at all
2933947 but try with your old antenna first because it may be ok

2933951 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
2933952 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
2933953 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now

2933968 i mean is this going to be something we cant even interpret through polling we can talk about the bradley effect because of what happened to tom bradley when he ran for governor of california and won in the polls twice and lost the governorship twice on election day ive seen theories about this that unless the african american candidate is able to get the election number he needs he wont get it that day he has to get it in the polling and barack hasnt cracked about 45 percent
2933969 pollsters look for the bradley effect the idea that some white voters are reluctant to say they support a white candidate over a black candidate the phrase refers to californias 1982 gubernatorial election when the late tom bradley a black democratic mayor of los angeles led in exit polls against white republican george deukmejian mr bradley lost the election the conclusion some voters hid their true choice from pollsters

2933977 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2933978 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2933979 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2933980 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2933981 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2933986 there were times id spend the day stretched out on the couch i couldnt move
2933987 i work from home a lot and i found that the way i sit at my computer is the worst way to sit if you have back pain
2933988 i lean against something or i dont put all of my weight over my lower back
2933989 i started taking into consideration things like when i buy new shoes i look for more support softer soles
2933990 except for a few twinges now and then i dont have any pain any more it was surprising its how you stand how you sit
2933991 there were no major purchases just lifestyle changes and exercises and stretches now i run a couple of days a week as of now im not having any acute back pain
2933992 many many people are at risk due to family history age genetic characteristics but we dont have a good prediction formula for who will actually get the disease
2933993 its clear that finding this disease at the earliest possible stage provides the best possible window for therapeutics
2933994 if you can make an early diagnosis you can think about trying to arrest the disease which is better than trying to reverse it
2933995 it will be an important piece of information used with other information to make an accurate diagnosis
2933996 i think people have a right to know but at the same time people should be counseled fully and not be led into getting these tests without knowing the risks and benefits

2934005 because most patients with knee replacement have lived with debilitating pain for years they work around the pain by adopting different strategies to avoid using their weakened quadriceps muscle in front of the thigh when going from a sitting to standing position
2934006 is that it shows that even following surgery this movement continued even as patients muscle strength improved
2934007 simply put it was a learned movement pattern that could not be resolved without retraining by a physical therapist usually beginning 4 6 weeks after surgery when weight can be put equally on both legs
2934008 i went to a doctor and told him it was really bad
2934009 normally they would crack your chest they dont have to crack your chest its like a turbo heart pump it kept me alive during the operation
2934010 it was the most amazing thing i went from near death to feeling pretty damn good
2934011 what we found is people who have lots of blockages we start working on one of the arteries that doesnt have a problem
2934012 if we work on the last artery thats open while were putting balloons and stents into the heart the heart cant pump and the patient really deteriorates the blood pressure drops and they can be at risk of having a stroke or a heart attack on the table
2934013 there are many people who have had heart attacks or severe damage to the heart muscles and the heart isnt able to function normally they are that weak
2934014 its a useful but a very inefficient way of supporting heart function
2934015 i wasnt even a candidate for surgery they were very much afraid they wouldnt be able to keep me alive
2934016 many dont realize that its not uncommon for athletes particularly football players in the southeast in august and september to have core body temperatures over 103 when competing
2934017 it is extremely important to test out new devices in randomized controlled trials like this one
2934018 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2934019 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2934020 this area is an area that could significantly do with a facelift
2934021 better exhibition space better grandstand facilities and much better use of the ekka space here
2934022 der rnf hat sich aus der motivation der frauen selbst gebildet da ist niemand gekommen der gesagt hat mach doch mal so was
2934023 institutionalisierte politik ist f r frauen einfach nicht so das bet tigungsfeld wir treffen uns und sprechen sehr viel inhaltlich
2934024 sie haben am infostand mehr erfolg bei der kontaktaufnahme zu passanten und sie bernehmen immer st rker arbeiten in den vorst nden
2934025 es ist nie so gewesen dass m nner sie verhindert oder daran gehindert h tten im gegenteil ich habe berall in der partei erlebt dass wenn frauen sich zur wahl gestellt haben sie berall den bonus bekommen haben
2934026 frauen in der rechten szene sind wie ein spiegelbild der gesellschaft das hei t sie k nnen ein traditionelles rollenmodell leben berufst tige m tter oder emanzipiert sein oder sogar gewaltbereit agieren
2934027 auch frauen sind politische akteurinnen sie gehen weit seltener als ihnen nachgesagt wird in die szene weil ihnen die jungs gefallen oder weil sie es dort besonders nett finden oder sie dort besonders hofiert werden sie gehen dahin weil sie rechts sind und rechte positionen haben f r die sie einstehen und k mpfen wollen
2934028 m nner und frauen sind f r uns nicht gleich sondern verschieden vom wesen her wir sehen im gender projekt das tiefgr ndigere interesse frauen und m nner gleichzuschalten v llig die identit ten zu verwischen alles austauschbar zu machen
2934029 unserer meinung nach ist sie im dienste der wirtschaft unterwegs um frauen als billige arbeitskr fte auf den markt zu holen
2934030 wir holen den armen l ndern die ihre fachkr fte eigentlich selbst zum aufbau ihrer wirtschaft brauchen die leute weg
2934031 ich sehe das wie einen teller mit knete wenn ich es zusammenmatsche bleibt am ende nur braun brig oder grau kulturen sind gewachsen aus v lkern und nicht weil v lkergruppen ausgetauscht worden sind
2934032 v lker sind nach der familie die wirksamsten gemeinschaften wie jede zu sch tzende pflanze und tierart sind sie eine bereicherung
2934033 was wir voraussehen ist ein kampf der kulturen der wird kommen und dann kann man sich nichts mehr sch n reden
2934034 wir sind anders wir t fteln nicht nur irgendwelche ref rmchen aus sondern wir haben eben einen ganz anderen ansatz des lebens wir versuchen heimatliebe naturliebe aber eben auch verbundenheit zur tradition und zur kultur in unserem leben umzusetzen
2934035 mein ex mann hatte die idee am 20 april zu heiraten das ist nat rlich eine provokation gewesen
2934036 frauen werden untersch tzt auch was ihre berufswahl angeht es ist in den unis schulen und kinderg rten noch nicht angekommen dass dort rechte sch lerinnen und studentinnen sitzen k nnten dass es welche gibt die ganz bewusst einen beruf ergreifen um die n chste generation mit ihrem gedankengut in kontakt zu bringen
2934037 aufgrund der zuschreibung dass frauen keine so politische haltung zugetraut wird kommen sie viel weiter mit ihrer unterwanderungsstrategie
2934038 with regular races the pressure is to run fast with this race the idea is to run at a pace that youre comfortable running
2934039 weve had people qualify for awards for the entire summer series that walked it
2934040 im coming back from a bike injury so this is my first pace series run this year
2934041 i like it because it forces you to pay attention to your body it makes you more disciplined sometimes you get behind somebody and they make you want to go faster you know you get a rabbit
2934042 i find that stretching makes me run about half a minute faster a mile
2934043 because its low key no pressure its more of a social gathering
2934044 normally we have water gatorade pretzels cookies and bananas at the end people stand around and talk about running or whatever else comes up
2934045 everyone teases him now because hes so big and doesnt fit in the stroller
2934046 but when people see me without him they dont recognize me
2934047 so i think heres where i am at my training level and my fitness level i usually put down a pace at about as fast as i can go
2934048 sometimes we are all off because we really are on each other for pacing
2934049 always had a soda on my desk id plan to start on monday and on sunday id gorge myself
2934050 i hadnt weighed myself for six years i stepped on a scale and thought id be 325 350 the scale said 481 i got tears in my eyes
2934051 i was 400 pounds 6 feet 5 inches i couldnt sit even when my company bought two seats for me
2934052 i got in trouble at my job because i couldnt travel
2934053 i had heart palpitations one day and nearly blacked out just walking up one flight of stairs
2934054 my doctor told me lose weight or id be dead before i was 40
2934055 every time id start a diet id gorge the day before
2934056 i would drink soda and eat an entire bag of doritos while i was watching television
2934057 he thought he was working out strenuously but he was just doing some minor work
2934058 the first thing we had to do was change his eating habits youre not going to lose weight unless you do that first
2934059 but considering he started at 481 pounds that would be a lot
2934060 there was something about him that i could see he was going to do this
2934061 one of the great things to take away from this he didnt make excuses he doesnt say im not going to work out today he knows that when he has aches or pains he has to work through it
2934062 when i told brett my legs were shot could i take a day off he said well take care of that i worked out an hour sitting on a bench i was uncomfortable for the first two months then the work became a habit thats natural to me now when i see people i havent seen for a while they wonder who is this guy and it takes awhile to see its me
2934063 get help even if you cant hire a personal trainer see a dietitian
2934064 i have really good friends im at a sports bar drinking water watching a game and my friends are eating all the stuff and they wont let me have any
2934065 when i get off work i 270 is terrible i go to the fitness center and work out for an hour when i go home the highway is clear and theres no stress
2934066 i see my programs without the interruptions and i have more time to work around the house work on the yard and not just sit around
2934067 i think dawn would literally kill me if she saw me with even a french fry
2934068 this is the way we take up up the ass
2934069 yah thats right my penis stuck in a hole at a childrens park
2934070 aint never seed nothin like that cept maybe escapen from prison
2934071 aint never seed nothin like that cept maybe escapen from prison
2934072 we figured it was now or never because we were constantly bei ng followed and figured we were about to be arrested
2934073 they treated us fairly well one person was kicked and the others were hit we got treated better than the people who live in tibet
2934074 everybodys physically fine a lot of us are emotionally shaken from this
2934075 he had to travel to china on his irish passport because he was denied a visa to china on his canadian passport likely because he has been a long time and outspoken tibet supporter

2934114 it may be the lesser of two evils because some evils are pretty evil
2934115 it is a certain fact that not all muslims are terrorists but it is equally certain and exceptionally painful that almost all terrorists are muslims
2934116 fortunately there will never be islamic unity theyre all different from one another and hostile to each other thank god
2934117 as for converting them muslims to christianity i think it might be a good idea to get them on some sort of hobby other than slaughtering infidels i mean perhaps thats the peace corps perhaps its working for planned parenthood but ive never seen the transforming effect of anything like christianity
2934118 what are we supposed to do if osama bin laden calls the united states

2934121 fewer than 10 u s citizens or residents a year according to an authoritative account have aroused enough suspicion during warrantless eavesdropping to justify interception of their purely domestic calls as well that step still requires a warrant from a federal judge for which the government must supply evidence of probable cause

2934127 i really do like the fact that no other european has won those two majors consecutively
2934128 because i obviously hold a lot of european players that i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
2934129 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major of sunday
2934130 i love it so much im actually disappointed im eight months away from the next major
2934131 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back

2934139 waarom zijn wij het slachtoffer ik ken zelfs geen davina
2934140 omdat we nooit langs de processieweg komen hadden we vrijdagavond nog niet gemerkt dat ook ons huis het doelwit van vandalen was geweest
2934141 mijn moeder belde laat op de avond of ik al gezien had wat er op de muur van ons huis te lezen was davina slet x hoer luidde het opschrift in koeien van letters dat was wel even schrikken ik vraag me af wie die davina is ik ken zelfs niemand die zo heet waarom schrijven ze dat dan bij ons op de muur met rode verf hadden ze dan weer lul op de weg geschilderd we hebben vernomen dat we niet het enige slachtoffer zijn
2934142 waarschijnlijk is het een bende die op verschillende plaatsen aan de slag is geweest onze gevel hebben ze er waarschijnlijk uitgepikt omdat die voor een groot stuk aan het zicht onttrokken is ook de overbuur heeft langs de processiestraat een blinde gevel je kan daar dus ongemerkt aan de slag omdat we het huis huren heb ik onmiddellijk de huisbaas op de hoogte gebracht die heeft de politie gecontacteerd elders zijn de rolluiken beklad bij ons is het de muur maar hoe gaan we die verf eraf krijgen en wat gaat dat kosten je staat daar zo machteloos tegenover ik kan je verzekeren dat dit een heel onaangenaam gevoel geeft

2934155 voor we aan deze onderneming begonnen hadden we al samen door azi en zuid amerika getrokken en afrika bereizen met een 4x4 langs niet voor de hand liggende locaties was iets wat we zeker in ons jonge leven wilden doen
2934156 ethiopi kenia zimbabwe en namibi soms moesten we om veiligheidsredenen afwijken van onze route bijvoorbeeld omdat het wegdek te slecht was in kenia en congo waren het dan weer rellen die ons deden uitwijken gelukkig konden we onze tijd volledig zelf bepalen slapen deden we in een tent die was bevestigd op het dak van onze jeep e n keer dachten we dat bobje het begeven had de achteruitversnelling deed het niet meer via de telefoon heeft een garagist uit peer ons gelukkig kunnen helpen
2934157 vaak was het hartelijk en had je niets te vrezen maar in ethiopi werden we als blanken voortdurend aangeklampt door bedelaars
2934158 zelfs in maatpak en met laptop aan de arm staken ze hun hand uit en als je niets gaf begonnen ze met keien te gooien naar de auto
2934159 wij kennen het hier als een dorre woestijn maar tot onze verrassing was het een enorm groen en vruchtbaar gebied dat is volgens ons de uitdaging in veel afrikaanse landen de plaatselijke bevolking helpen om profijt te halen uit die grote rijkdom
2934160 we zijn door natuurparken gereden die vele malen groter dan belgi waren we ontmoetten dan ook wel eens toeristen en telkens polsten ze of belgi nog bestond
2934161 op een weg zagen we door de voorruit plots een volwassen olifant onze kant opkomen we stopten deden de ruiten dicht zodat het beest ons eten niet kon ruiken met zijn slurf en afgebroken slagstanden heeft hij ons flink door elkaar geschud en bobje van een bluts voorzien
2934162 een dubbel gevoel was dat blij dat we het hebben kunnen waarmaken en spijt dat het voorbij was

2934177 i very rarely think of myself as a pastors wife i think of myself as mikes wife im allowed to be who jesus calls me to be and its wonderful
2934178 people are hungry for jesus and to have people come alongside and be their friends people want to see jesus in you not hear you talk about it show them who he is by who you are
2934179 i enjoy the details ive always been drawn to numbers and organized things
2934180 when i got toward the end of my career i decided i didnt want to be a one school career
2934181 the interesting thing for me is dalton school board meetings are very informal because the dalton schools have hired great people
2934182 ashland and mansfield they often have many many people in dalton apparently the community puts much trust in their board
2934183 i would love to see more people involved so they can see the business of running the district
2934184 its been an exciting adventure to see where god has taken us through the years
2934185 i never had any idea it would take me all the way to treasurer at mansfield

2934187 i am a bit embarrassed i am just doing my job
2934188 it can be sad but i dont think too deeply and i always think about the other people i am dealing with and that helps you have to put the other people first the clients are the main thing
2934189 when i see someone going out the front door and saying that wasnt as bad as i thought it would be i know it has gone well
2934190 that is the best thing knowing its all gone smoothly and ive helped people

2934224 while the focus of tb control is on prompt case detection and effective treatment better housing conditions and reduced levels of crowding also have a role in controlling the spread of this disease
2934225 unlike some previous studies we were able to control for the effects of known risk factors notably poverty and migration from high incidence countries linking to census data also allowed us to include a relatively large number of cases
2934226 the finding that tb rates are associated with crowded living conditions fits with what we know about the transmission of this bacteria via small airborne droplets
2934227 household crowding increases opportunities for active cases to infect other household members particularly children

2934236 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
2934237 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love

2934369 something about this rubs me the wrong way the restaurants own the tables not some independent contractors

2934385 social justice equality and dignity of persons are cornerstone of social democracy social justice is a dynamic device to mitigate the suffering of the poor weak dalits tribals and deprived sections of the society and to elevate them to the level of equality to live their lives with dignity of person social security just and humane conditions of work and leisure of workman are part of his meaningful right to life and to achieve self expression of his personality and to enjoy the life with dignity
2934386 in the present case the contention on behalf of the respondents that the regularisation was itself a mode of appointment under article 162 of the constitution is unsound the rules came into existence in the present case in 1964 the regularisation was made in the year 1967 the regularisation was made with effect from 1958 therefore the rules became applicable the regularisation in the present case was also bad because even without specific methods of requirement appointments could be made only by selection or promotion or transfer from equivalent grade the method of recruitment and qualification for each state civil service was to be set forth in the rules of recruitment of such service specially made in that behalf
2934387 all that the public service commission did was to regularise the appointment to the post of the principal the regularisation by the state of the appointment is with effect from 1958 this regularisation is bad for the following reasons first regularisation is not itself a mode of appointment secondly the modes of appointments are direct recruitment or selection or promotion or appointing for reasons to be recorded in writing an officer holding a post of an equivalent grade by transfer from any other service of the state
2934388 it was argued that the regularisation of the promotion gave it the colour of permanence and the appointments of the promotees as assistant engineers must therefore be deemed to have been made substantively right from the 1st of november 1956 the argument however is unacceptable to us for two reasons firstly the words regular or regularisation do not connote permanence they are terms calculated to condone any procedural irregularities and are meant to care only such defects as are attributable to the methodology followed in making the appointments they cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of the appointments
2934389 we may take note of the pernicious consequences to which the direction of regularisation of workmen on the only ground that they have put in works for 240 or more days has been leading although there is employment exchange act which requires recruitment on the basis of registration in employment exchange it has become a common practice to ignore the employment exchange and the person registered in the employment exchange and to employ and get employed directly those who are either not registered or are lower in the long waiting list in the employment register the court can take judicial notice of the fact that such employment is sought and given directly for various illegal consideration including money the employment is given for temporary periods with technical breaks to circumvent the relevant rules and is continued for 240 or more days with a view to give the benefit of regularisation knowing the judicial trend that those who have completed 240 or more days are directed to be automatically regularised a good deal of illegal employment market has developed resulting in a new source of corruption and frustration of those who are waiting at the employment exchange for years not all those who gain such back door entry in the employment are in need of the particular jobs though already employed elsewhere they join the job for better and secured prospects that is why most of the cases which come to the courts are of employment in government departments public undertaking or agencies ultimately it is the people who bear the heavy burden of the surplus labour the other equally injurious effect to indiscriminate regularisation has been that many of the agencies have stopped undertaking casual or temporary works though they are urgent and essential for fear that those who are employed on such works are required to be continued for 240 more days have to be absorbed as regular employees although the works are time bound and there is no need of the workmen beyond the completion of the works undertaken the public interests thus jeopardised on both courts
2934390 adhoc appointments a convenient way of entry usually from backdoor at times even in disregard of rules and regulations are comparatively recent innovation to the service jurisprudence they are individual problems to begin with become a family problem in court of law it is unjust and unfair to those who are lesser fortunate in society with little or no approach even though better qualified more meritorious and well deserving the infection is widespread in govt or semi government departments or state financed institutions it arises either because the appointing authority resorts to it deliberately as a favour or to accommodate someone or for any extraneous reason ignoring the regular procedure provided for recruitment as a pretext under emergency measure or to avoid loss of work etc or the rules or circulars issued by the department itself empower the authority to do so as a stop gap arrangement the former is an abuse of power it is unpardonable even if it is found to have been resorted to as a genuine emergency measure the courts should be reluctant to grant indulgence latter gives rise to equities which have bothered courts every now and then
2934391 there is still another reason why the high court cannot be equated with this court the constitution has by article 142 empowered the supreme court to make such orders as may be necessary for doing complete justice in any case or matter pending before it which authority the high court does not enjoy the jurisdiction of the high court while dealing with a writ petition is circumscribed by the limitations discussed and declared by the judicial decisions and it cannot transgress the limits on the basis of whims or subjective sense of justice varying from judge to judge
2934392 from the facts placed before us it appears that the scheme under which the petitioners are working is of a very specific nature there is no permanent need for the work and since it is a project for a particular purpose it will not be possible to direct that the petitioner may be regularised in service
2934393 existence of statutory rules is not a condition precedent to appoint an eligible and fit person to a post the executive power is co extensive with legislative power of the state and under article 162 the state can create civil posts and fill them up according to executive instructions consistent with articles 14 and 16 of the constitution it is settled law that once statutory rules have been made the appointment shall be only in accordance with the rules the executive power could be exercised only to fill in the gaps but the instructions cannot and should not supplant the law but would only supplement the law
2934394 a little leeway to make ad hoc appointment due to emergent exigencies does not clothe the executive govt with power to relax the recruitment or to regularise such appointment nor to claim such appointments to be regular or in accordance with rules back door ad hoc appointments at the behest of power source or otherwise and recruitment according to rules are mutually antagonistic and strange bed partners they cannot coexist in the same sheath the former in negation of fair play the latter are the product of order and regularity every eligible person not necessarily be fit to be appointed to a post or office under the state selection according to rules by a properly constituted commission and fitment for appointment assures fairness in selection and inhibits arbitrariness in appointments
2934395 it is now well settled law that that appointment promotion must be in accordance with the rules direct recruitee takes his seniority from the date on which he starts discharging the duty of the post borne on the cadre while a temporary appointee appointed dehors the rules or on ad hoc basis or to a fortuitous vacancy gets seniority from the date of regular appointment
2934396 in a k bhatnagar vs union of india 1991 1 scc 544 this court while deprecating the practice of the government giving a go by to the statutory rules or regulations framed under proviso to art 309 of the constitution making large scale departure expressed thus
2934397 employment to government service in the irrigation department is regulated by statutory rules presently the respondent no 2 was not employed in accordance with the rules for engaging a person casually on day to day basis the statutory rules are not required to be followed under which the posts have to be advertised and only the best from the market have to be picked up keeping in view reservation provided from certain classes thus every eligible person has an opportunity to participate in the recruitment process this is not so in the case of daily wager in whose case even regularisation regarding age medical fitness character roll etc are not observed therefore daily and casual workers who are engaged in disregard of all rules cannot be allowed to enter government service through the back door and the labour court cannot be allowed to be used as a legal means for such back door entry the anomalous situation that the impugned award creates can be seen from the fact that till before his alleged retrenchment the respondent no 2 was on engagement from day today the impugned award makes him a permanent employee with the necessary consequence that he would have to be paid salary for all the 365 days as regular employee and the other benefits of regular employment can also not be denied to him thus the award put him in as much better position that he was before the alleged retrenchment such a result is not conceived
2934398 when the scheme itself was over and it was known to him that his requirement was only during the currency of the scheme then no relief could be granted
2934399 it is common knowledge that the government as a welfare state floats several schemes and projects generating employment opportunities though they are short lived the objective is to meet the need of the moment the benefit of such schemes and project is that for the duration they exist they provide employment and livelihood to such persons as would not have been able to secure the same but for such schemes or projects if the workmen employed for fulfilling the need of such passing phase projects or schemes were to become a liability on the employer state by too liberally interpreting the labour laws in favour of the workmen then the same may well act as a disincentive to the state for floating such schemes and the state may opt to keep away from initiating such schemes and projects even in times of dire need because it may feel that by opening the gates of welfare it would be letting in onerous obligations entailed upon it by extended application of the labour laws
2934400 that when posts temporarily created for fulfilling the needs of a particular project or scheme limited in its duration come to an end because the need for the project comes to an end either because the need was fulfilled or the project had to be abandoned wholly or partially for want of funds the employer cannot by a writ of mandamus be directed to continue employing such employees as have been dislodged because such a direction would amount to requisition for creation of posts though not required by the employer and funding such posts though the employer did not have funds available for the purpose
2934401 6 the question of regularization of daily wages employees has been subject matter of judicial scrutiny for a long time in a developing country various schemes are implemented these schemes are supported by limited financial allocation the employees appointed on daily wages in such schemes are fully aware of its temporary nature and also the nature and terms of their appointment in daily rated casual labour employed under p amp t department v union of india 1988 1 scc 122 the supreme court considered the rights of the daily rated casual labour and directed for submission of a scheme to extend permanent status of the workmen state of haryana and others v piara singh and others 1992 4 scc 118 was a case of ad hoc temporary government employees and consider the validity of the orders of regularisation made by state of haryana in which supreme court held that eligible and qualified continue in service satisfactorily for a long periods raises presumption of need of regular posts later on there has been a marked changed in law relating to regularisation of daily rated employees in ghaziabad development authority amp others v vikram chaudhary 1995 5 scc 210 it was held that in the absence of availability of posts for regular appointment regularisation cannot be directed and that the daily rated employees should be given minimum wages under the statute if any or the prevailing wages in the locality in state of himachal pradesh v nodha ram jt 1996 1 sc 220 it has been held that where a project is completed and closed due to non availability of funds the employees have to go along with its closure no vested right is created in temporary employments directions can not be given to regularise their services in the absence of any existing vacancies nor can directions be given to the state to create posts in a non existing establishment in this case supreme court found that the directions issued by court for regularisation were illegal warranting interference
2934402 it is seen that when the project is completed and closed due to non availability of funds the employees have to go along with its closure
2934403 although there is employment exchange act which requires recruitment on the basis of registration in employment exchange it has become a common practice to ignore the employment exchange and the person registered in the employment exchange and to employ and get employed directly those who are either not registered or are lower in the long waiting list in the employment register the court can take judicial notice of the fact that such employment is sought and given directly for various illegal consideration including money the employment is given for temporary periods with technical breaks to circumvent the relevant rules and is continued for 240 days or more days with a view to give the benefit of regularization knowing the judicial trend that those who have completed 240 days or more days are directed to the automatically regularized a good deal of illegal employment market has developed resulting in a new source of corruption and frustration of those who are waiting at the employment exchange for years
2934404 i am of the considered view that wholesale and unconditional orders cannot be issued by this court directing the respondents to regularize the services of the petitioners and in no case such direction can be issued in the absence of posts and a scheme rules visualizing regularization on certain principles and norms framed in consonance with the related constitutional provisions for regularisation has not been claimed herein in the above sense of the term rather it comprehends induction into the cadre of the service which in the absence of posts and a legally framed scheme cannot be allowed except on pains of violating the constitution and relevant service rules
2934405 making appointment on daily wages without the availability of the post and without following the provisions of articles 14 and 16 suffers from patent illegality apparently for the reasons which are only extraneous the officers of the departent have given appointments on daily wages to few favoured those who have waited in queue at the employment exchange have been altogether ignored in fact while the length of the queue continuously increase the back door entrants got the entry in service as daily wages employee and got the order of appointment on salary in the regular pay scale and ultimately the order of regularisation on the service
2934406 we cannot lose sight of the fact that the recruitment rules made under article 309 of the constitution have to be followed strictly and not in breach if a disregard of the rules and by passing of the public service commissions are permitted it will open a back door for illegal recruitment without limit in fact this court has of late been witnessing a constant violation of the recruitment rules and a scant respect for the constitutional provisions requiring recruitment to the services through the public service commission it appears that since this court has in some cases permitted regularisation of the irregularly recruited employees some governments and authorities have been increasingly resorted to irregular recruitments the result had been that the recruitment rules and the public service commissions have been kept in cold storage and candidate dictated by various considerations are being recruited as a matter of course
2934407 nor the claim of the appellant that she having worked as lecturer without break for 9 years on the date the advertisement was issued she should be deemed to have been regularised appears to be well founded eligibility and continuous working for howsoever long period should not be permitted to over reach the law requirement of rules of selection cannot be substituted by humane considerations law must take its course
2934408 this being so those who come to be appointed by such arbitrary procedure can hardly complain if the termination of their appointment is equally arbitrary those who come by the backdoor have to go by the same door the fact that they are made by public bodies cannot best them with additional sanctity every appointment made to a public office howsoever made is not there is therefore no public interest involved in saving all appointments irrespective of their mode from the inception some engagements and contracts may be the product of the operation of the spoils system there need be no legal anxiety to save them
2934409 expression service rules cannot be given a restrictive meaning in the absence of the definition of the said terms and therefore it would include within its sweep the necessary government order providing the method recruitment
2934410 assuming that the respondent was asked to work in a factory in anticipation of securing appointment that too by an officer who was not competent to give appointment that did not make the respondent a workman or regular employee of the appellant company
2934411 it is well settled that equation of posts and determination of pay scales is the primary function of the executive and not the judiciary and therefore ordinarily courts will not enter upon the task of job evaluation which is generally left to expert bodies
2934412 from the conspectus of views taken in the aforementioned decided cases the position is clear that to substantiate a claim of higher scale of pay salary on the basis of the principle equal pay for equal work the petitioners will have to establish that they are equally placed in all respects with the person or persons whose scale of pay salary they claim they must allege and prove that the mode of recruitment eligibility qualifications prescribed the nature of duties responsibilities discharged and the service rules if any applicable to the two posts are similar they cannot succeed in the case merely by showing that they have been discharging the same duties which are being discharged by persons holding the other class of posts
2934413 a scale of pay is attached to a definite post and in case of a daily wager he holds no posts the respondent workers on daily wages in haryana roadways cannot be held to hold any posts to claim even any comparison with the regular and permanent staff for any or all purposes including a claim for equal pay and allowances to claim a relief on the basis of equality it is for the claimants to substantiate a clear cut basis of equivalence and a resultant hostile discrimination before becoming eligible to claim rights on a par with the other group vis vis an alleged discrimination no material was placed before the high court as to the nature of the duties of either categories and it is not possible to hold that the principle of equal pay for equal work is an abstract one however the appellant state has to ensure that minimum wages are prescribed for such workers and the same is paid to them equal pay for equal work is a concept which requires for its applicability complete and wholesale identity between a group of employees claiming identical pay scales and the other group of employees who have already earned such pay scale the problem about equal pay cannot always be translated into a mathematical formula
2934414 10 the respondents therefore in the present appeals who are employed on daily wages cannot be treated as on a par with persons in regular service of the state of haryana holding similar posts daily rated workers are not required to possess the qualifications prescribed for regular workers nor do they have to fulfil the requirement relating to age at the time of recruitment they are not selected in the manner in which regular employees are selected in other words the requirements for selection are not as rigorous there are also other provisions relating to regular service such as the liability of a member of the service to be transferred and his being subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the authorities as prescribed which the daily rated workmen are not subjected to they cannot therefore be equated with regular workmen for the purposes for their wages nor can they claim the minimum of the regular pay scale of the regularly employed 11 the high court was therefore no right in directing that the respondents should be paid the same salary and allowances as are being paid to regular employees holding similar posts with effect from the dates when the respondents were employed if a minimum wage is prescribed for such workers the respondents would be entitled to it if it is more than what they are being paid
2934415 the principle of equal pay for equal work has been considered and applied in many reported decisions of this court
2934416 daily rated workers casual workers who are not regularized and work is taken from them are entitled to minimum of scale of pay prescribed for that post and in addition to that they are also entitled to 60 of the d a on punjab pattern which is being followed in all others cases
2934417 it may be true that the petitioners have not been regularly recruited but many of them have been working continuously for more than a year in the department and some of them have been engaged as casual labourers for nearly ten years they are rendering the same kind of service which is being rendered by the regular employees doing the same type of work clause 2 of article 38 of the constitution of india which contains one of the directive principles of state policy provides that the state shall in particular strive to minimize the inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status facilities and opportunities not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged indifferent vocations even though the above directive principle may not be enforceable as such by virtue of article 37 of the constitution of india it may be relied upon by the petitioners to show that in the instant case they have been subjected to hostile discrimination it is urged that the state cannot deny at least the minimum pay in the pay scales of regularly employed workmen even though the government may not be compelled to extend all the benefits enjoyed by regularly recruited employees we are of the view that such denial amounts to exploitation of labour the government cannot take advantage of its dominant position and compel any worker to work even as a casual labourer on starvation wages it be that the casual labourer has agreed to work on such low wages that he has done because he has no other choice it is poverty that has driven him to that state the government should be a model employer we are of the view that on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the classification of employees into regularly recruited employees and casual employees for the purpose of paying less than the minimum pay payable to employees in the corresponding regular cadres particularly in the lowest rungs of the department where the pay scales are the lower is not tenable india is a socialist republic it implies the existence of certain important obligations which the state has to discharge the right to work the right to free choice of employment the right to just and favourable conditions of work the right to protection against unemployment the right of everyone who works to just and favourable remuneration ensuring a decent living for himself and his family the right of every one without discrimination of any kind to equal pay for equal work the right to rest leisure reasonable limitation on working hours and periodic holidays with pay the right to form trade unions and the right to joint trade unions of ones choice and the right to security of work are some of the rights which have to be ensured by appropriate legislative and executive measures it is true that all these rights cannot be extended simultaneously but they do indicate the socialist goal the degree of achievement in this direction depends upon the economic resources willingness of the people to produce and more than all the existence of industrial peace throughout the country of those rights the question of security of work is of utmost importance if a person does not have the feeling that he belongs to an organization engaged in production he will not put forward his best effort to produce more that sense of belonging arises only when he feels that he will not be turned out of employment the next day at the whim of the management it is for this reason it is being repeatedly observed by those who are in charge of economic affairs of the countries in different parts of the world that as far as possible security of work should be assured to the employees as that they my contribute to the maximization of production it is again for this reason that managements and the governmental agencies in particular should not allow workers to remain as casual labourers or temporary employees for an unreasonably long period of time
2934418 it is true that principles of equal pay for equal work is not expressly declared by our constitution to be a fundamental right but it certainly is a constitutional goal article 39 d of the constitution proclaims equal pay for equal work for both men and women as a directive principle of state policy equal pay for equal work for both men and women means equal for pay and equal work for everyone and as between the sexes directive principles as has been pointed out in some of the judgments of this court have to be read into the fundamental rights as a matter of interpretation article 14 of the constitution enjoins the state not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws and article 16 declares that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the state these equality clauses of the constitution must mean something to everyone to the vast majority of the people the equality clauses of the constitution would mean nothing if they are unconcerned with the work they do and the pay they get to them the equality clauses will have some substance if equal work means equal pay whether the special procedure prescribed by a statute for trying alleged robber barons and smuggler kings or for dealing with tax evaders is discriminatory whether a particular governmental policy in the matter of grant of licences or permits confers unfettered discretion on the executive whether the takeover of the empires of industrial tycoons is arbitrary and unconstitutional and other questions of like nature leave the millions of people of this country untouched question concerning wages and the like munhdane they may be are yet matters of vital concern to them and it is there if at all that the equality clauses of the constitution have any significance to them construing articles 14 and 16 of the constitution in the light of the preamble and article 39 d we are of the view that the principle equal pay for equal work is deducible for those articles and maybe properly applied to cases of unequal scales of pay based on no classification or irrational classification though those drawing the different scales of pay do identical work under the same employer
2934419 we accordingly allow this writ petition and direct the respondents to pay wages to the workmen who are employed as the contingent paid staff of the income tax department throughout india doing the work of class iv employees at the rates equivalent to the minimum pay in the pay scale of the regularly employed workers in the corresponding cadres
2934420 11 this court in union of india and others v pradip kumar dey 2000 8 scc 580 jt 2000 s2 sc 449 after referring to various decisions dealing with the similar question in para 8 has held thus
2934421 in our considered view the division bench of the high court was not right and justified in straightway giving direction to grant pay scale to the respondent when there was no material placed before the court for comparison in order to apply the principle of
2934422 47 no doubt in certain decisions the courts have given directions for regularising daily wagers or casual temporary employees but in our opinion such directions do not amount to a precedent vide indian council of agricultural research v raja balwant singh college 2003 1 esc 424 delhi administrtion v manoharlal air 2002 sc 3088 etc what is a binding precedent is a principle of law which has been laid down in a decision of the court and a mere direction without laying down any principle of law not a precedent a case is an authority for what it actually decides vide goodyear india ltd v state of haryana air 1990 sc 781 sreenivasa general traders v state of a p air 1983 sc 1246 para 29 union of india v dhanwanti devi 1996 6 scc 44 paragraphs 9 and 10 m s amar nath om prakash v state of punjab and others air 1985 sc 218 etc everything in a decision is not a precedent vide state of punjab v baldeo singh 1999 scc cri 1080
2934423 the executive authority of the state must be held to be within its competence to frame a policy for the administration of the state unless the policy framed is absolutely capricious and not being informed by any reason whatsoever can be clearly held to be arbitrary and founded on mere ipse dixit of the executive functionaries thereby offending article 14 of the constitution or such policy offends other constitutional provisions or comes into conflict with any statutory provision the court cannot and should not outstep its limit and tinker with the policy decision of the executive functionary of the state this court in no uncertain terms has sounded a note of caution by indicating that policy decision is in the domain of the executive authority of the state and the court should not embark on the unchartered ocean of public policy and should not question the efficacy or otherwise of such policy so long the same does not offend any provision of the statute or the constitution of india the supremacy of each of the three organs of the state i e legislature executive and judiciary in their respective fields of operation needs to be emphasized the power of judicial review of the executive and legislative action must be kept within the bounds of constitutional scheme so that there may not be any occasion to entertain misgivings about the role of judiciary in outstepping its limit by unwarranted judicial activism being very often talked of in these days the democratic set up to which the policy is so deeply committed cannot function properly unless each of the three organs appreciate the need for mutual respect and supremacy in their respective fields

2934501 so youre telling me you havent fallen asleep at the wheel on any trips youve made with her
2934502 i focus on smooth driving occasionally if i catch a groove in the pavement or get blown to one side and my outside wheels catch the wake up strip outside the yellow line ill ease it back over smoothly if she had bothered to ask me about it first shed damned well know that and if i dont have a ten foot wide breakdown lane as a cushion i hold it tight
2934503 i told her id check into it and i have
2934504 pretty good i thought up until now shes gonna need some remedial education in working and playing well with others that will start tomorrow night
2934505 now dont go retaliating just because i told you she came to me with a concern
2934506 you warned me before i ever got cleared and so did everyone else but relax im not going to break any rules she is going to adjust her attitude though or working as my partner is going to turn into an experiment in just how much humiliation a basic emt can endure before she straightens up or quits
2934507 several of us said that very thing when we assigned you as her partner try not to leave any marks ad
2934508 lets shut it down and get in the back of the rig
2934509 ssm means system status management imagine getting in your truck at the beginning of the shift and not getting out again until the shift is over
2934510 if were not at ours were at one of the other stations except for the rare occasion like this in a ssm system they dont even have stations you have no idea how good you have it here
2934511 theyll only move us again thirty minutes after we go to sleep our dispatchers are so stupid honestly i am so tired of the borg this place is so chickenshit
2934512 go follow your ex partner i hear they have openings
2934513 that is if youre willing to stop pissing and moaning long enough to listen to it
2934514 im gonna sound like an old man when i say this and thats guaranteed to make you roll your eyes and tune out everything i say
2934515 you havent listened to anything ive said in two months but im gonna say it anyway there is a certain degree of chickenshit at every company you work for theyre just chickenshit in different ways there are stupid dispatchers at every company just like every company has its share of emts who are impossible to please
2934516 but it aint gonna make anything better you run into these same things everywhere you go this is ems kid this is the profession you got into you can either find what satisfaction you can in it or get out of ems entirely this is as good as it gets bp
2934517 im a good emt i dont want to get out of ems
2934518 you just suck as a partner and im telling you the things youre looking for youre not going to find in another company doesnt matter where you go bp people are pretty much the same wherever you go you bitch about bullshit calls stupid patients clueless dispatchers mindless bureaucracy and system abuse those kinds of things are found in every ems system bp the problem isnt ems at the borg the problem is your perception of what ems is the problem is you
2934519 what the fuck are people doing on the road at 3 am
2934520 thats why you work a twelve hour shift if you cant manage your second and third jobs childcare and your busy social calendar without expecting to sleep through an entire shift at your primary job perhaps you should seek employment elsewhere
2934521 you can bitch to me as long and as loudly as you want because im your partner but you better stop channeling your rage through your driving and when you get out at that scene you goddamned well better be 100 sweetness and light and calm professionalism you show your ass in public once more and ill have a new partner by the next shift and im the only medic who will work with you as it is bp
2934522 but were gonna stabilize it and getcha to a hospital right quick okay maybe even get you some pain medication along the way howd that be
2934523 bleeding control on that foot spinal packaging and rapid transport lets go bp
2934524 if you would just hold that leg while my partner gets her foot bandaged and when we move her onto the board i want you to hold traction on that leg okay
2934525 we gotta get you on this board and to do that we gotta move your leg itll hurt hon
2934526 but it had to be done dont worry yourself about it
2934527 ill let you move your right leg to wherever its most comfortable in return you dont move another body part unless i tell you okay
2934528 if youre gonna engage in a pissing contest with your patient make sure its over something that matters now wrap that foot tightly and dont pussyfoot around with it
2934529 and shes only going to get worse while i sit here and argue with you youre interfering with her care
2934530 you better back your ass outta my rig or im gonna
2934531 these are your choices hoss you can shut up and ride back here with your wife or you can continue to threaten and ill make sure you go to jail and the whole time youre showing your ass while the deputy bodily pulls you outta my rig your wife is just gonna get sicker so whats it gonna be
2934532 yell at me or my partner once more and you go to jail and that applies all the way to the point we pull up to the hospital we clear
2934533 fine walk around the rig to the side door get in and strap yourself into that jump seat lets roll bp
2934534 kevin its ad on cct 206 five minute eta with a status one patient
2934535 helmeted female mid forties no reported loss of consciousness multiple fractures of the left femur tib fib and ankle avulsion of the soft tissues of the left foot with profuse bleeding bp is only 68 palp heart rate is well lower than youd think it would be only 60 per minute were gonna need the trauma room dude
2934536 high flow oxygen 14 gauge iv with fluids running and the bleeding is under control see you in five minutes
2934537 the main drug i can give her tends to make the bp crap out a bit when you give enough for it to do any good right now im trying to save her life maybe if i get her pressure up enough they can get her some pain relief in the er
2934538 but were doing what we need to get it back up at the hospital theyll give her blood and take her to emergency surgery
2934539 dude how much you had to drink is between you and the cops i see no reason to tell them anything and from the looks of things she had no time to avoid the car if you had left when she did youd have either watched it happen or been laying on a spine board right next to her dont blame yourself i had one turn in front of me not two weeks ago she damned near killed me
2934540 im still stove up but as soon as i can get my bike replaced ill be up again i love it
2934541 now a permanent resident of the salvage yard on highway 103 east of here a ways it was totaled
2934542 i ride an electro glide and she has a sportster
2934543 used to be mine she liked riding it so much i got another one for myself
2934544 just follow us inside and ill show you where the registration desk is so you can get her signed in
2934545 remember what i said dude getting pissed doesnt speed things up for her go where the man tells you and ill come get you in a few minutes
2934546 her husband is outside and i promised id fill him in on things
2934547 but theres just too much damage vascular and ortho are just arguing over how high to cut it off personally i dont see why they cant have that damned conversation over an or table weve done all we can do down here
2934548 have the clerk put them in the family room and say the er doc will be in to talk with them in a little while you can tell them shes stabilized but dont tell them about the amputation okay
2934549 so how was my driving did it meet your standards
2934550 i think ill be requesting a new partner first thing in the morning
2934551 we have had four brilliant months in worcester where my colleague ross lawford and the rest of us at the rspb have endured the same emotional rollercoaster of excitement and grief as thousands of local people over the changing fortunes of the peregrine family
2934552 the fact that we ended up with two healthy youngsters should be celebrated and we hope they will flourish as they roam the worcestershire skies in the years to come
2934553 however we know that peregrines and other birds of prey fall victim to human persecution all too often and we encourage everybody who cares about these birds to help us stamp out the illegal persecution of birds of prey by signing our online campaign pledge on
2934554 this has indeed been an exciting summer and we hope the adult peregrines will choose to breed in worcester next year
2934555 meanwhile we appeal to local businesses and individuals to help sponsor the project in terms of a new camera and other equipment to give us sharper pictures which will hopefully lead to an even better experience for everybody who wishes to follow the lives of worcesters wild peregrines during the breeding season

2934587 though we expect a continued deterioration as the year goes on as american and european consumers stay at home the resilience of demand for chinas exports is still remarkable
2934588 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time
2934589 all legal avenues have not fully been exhausted thats why the question of clemency is not on the table yet
2934590 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2934591 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2934592 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2934593 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2934594 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2934595 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties

2934603 meine crew ist mit richtig guten leuten besetzt auf die ich mich verlassen kann
2934604 basis f r den bisherigen erfolg die nichts dem zufall berlassen m chte
2934605 it was actually a small label called source that was eaten by virgin which was part of its downfall the band kind of split up at the end of a cruel hot tour in the states but probably for the best i think what made simian interesting was the sort of tensions within particularly musically but we were pulling more in an electronic direction up until the point that it was actually not so productive
2934606 jas and i had already started djing while we were in the band we started out playing really eclectic sets because it was more what we wanted to hear wed play stuff like sun ra raymond scott really all over the shop but we really really enjoyed it and that was the main thing then when the band split up we sort of carried on djing wed already started doing a few remixes while we were in the band and we were also making mixtapes that represented our dj sets at the time some of them got printed up by the label mixtapes called simian mobile disco they were just little promos but thats where we made the name up because we were in simian it was just a jokey name if wed thought about that band ending and this being a new band we wouldve made up a new name but it didnt work like that
2934607 we are your friends came up because of a france only remix competition for one of the singles we did with simian
2934608 we picked the one that seemed the furthest away from the track which was just really noisy and distorted but also on that cd was the we are your friends justice remix that was about 4 years before it actually came out from there they got signed to ed banger and pedro winter put that out as a 12
2934609 weve always had a sort of well not contrary but we sort of try to do the opposite
2934610 well in that case i guess weve always been quite contrary laughs maybe people expect us to play ed bangers or distorted electro but we dont play any of that stuff weve just been djing in america and i think there especially justice are doing really well obviously with our association with them people expect us to play that sort of music i suppose we play quite minimal stuff really stripped out disco but thats just the stuff were excited about
2934611 we actually only intended to do very few live shows we knew we didnt want to put a proper live band together because wed been down that route with simian and although both of us play instruments we didnt really feel that represented the record so the closest thing we could think of is to pretty much build a studio on stage and have loads of room for us to experiment and improvise then we kind of realised that people wouldnt know what we were doing so we thought wed get shitloads of lights to make it more interesting for other people to watch
2934612 the main thing is that it is actually something organic we really didnt want to be behind laptops we really like old gear we like the way it makes you approach making music we were very keen to have that as part of our live show so weve got old synthesizers and drum machines on there really weve made it quite flexible so we can change it every time we do it and because were mixing it all live as well there are lots of areas where we can mix it up on the spot makes it more tied to a moment i suppose
2934613 there are quite a few moments where absolutely nothing is planned and they dont always go well but thats kind of the beauty of it different things are appropriate for different nights if were playing to a bar type crowd were not going to play tracks really long and stripped out well play the shorter punchier tracks maybe even more vocal ones but then quite often well play in a dance venue like fabric and at fabric you can get away with playing a track for ten minutes maybe you only play half the tunes you normally would but you play them different were not that good of showmen if were bored we look bored so at least this way it keeps us on our toes
2934614 we dug through a lot of stuff thats not very current with a lot of mix cds you do them and you know its just going to go out and do its thing but we always think a fabric mix is something that sticks around a lot longer we werent aiming to make it the most current mix of tunes of course there will be a few new things but a lot of it is us digging back into our record collections just the stuff that people may have forgotten about or that went overlooked
2934615 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region

2934618 the u n secretary general is profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict
2934619 precision strikes against military infrastructure in order to prevent georgian aircraft and military attack on our peacekeepers
2934620 we want to force the georgian leadership to peace and what we see right now on the ground is that georgian troops not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2934621 my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire
2934622 for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2934623 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2934624 show me your favourite photograph and tell me why its your favourite it can be one youve taken yourself or one someone else has taken a snapshot or a more professional image is there a story behind it do you love it for the memories it gives or just because its pleasing to the eye show me and tell me

2934653 except for the incorporation paper the oldest thing i have is minutes from a 1957 meeting at the gazette auditorium and a copy of the 1957 mooring fees
2934654 a bunch of records have been lost in the floods
2934655 i remember when they had barges made of wood instead of steel
2934656 boat club members used the sides as gunnels to moor their boats fifty five gallon drums under the barges kept them afloat
2934657 you know how long a barge is well the gunnels were that length with three or four more hooked to it depending on how many boats they had
2934658 my father was spoiled he didnt do anything he played a lot
2934659 my grandfather was philander chase knox u s secretary of state u s attorney general and a u s senator from pennsylvania he cosigned the note for walter clark to buy the charleston daily mail
2934660 he was going back to washington when he met my mother at the train station he came back and married her
2934661 my dad was the first to have a chris craft cruiser on the river i must have been 12 when we got the boat he called it miss gloria what they were going to name me if theyd had a girl
2934662 having a boat is about 90 percent work and 10 percent pleasure i used to have to take it to cincinnati just to get the bottom painted
2934663 when my dad started boating gasoline was 10 cents a gallon there wasnt a road tax back then
2934664 they would start up the river as far as maybe this side of marmet stop the engine tie some boats together drink and talk a while then float back down river

2934677 the boat club bought what extra property the hospital needed to put in the day care center
2934678 the club still controls the entire parcel that keeps the place going
2934679 fifty foot lots would probably have been maybe 50 they own about three blocks of riverfront property lots not large enough to accommodate houses
2934680 we took that thing from charleston to new orleans during the worlds fair another time 12 or 14 boats took a trip to the wvu pitt game there were 13 locks to go through
2934681 for about 30 years members did all the work built the docks cut grass anything that needed to be done
2934682 in the mid 1960s they got their first commercial slips before that people built their personal boat houses
2934683 and now most of the club is commercially built covered slips
2934684 first they had to put in new steel gunnels to hold the new harbor house
2934685 they were built in indiana in two sections tom jones brought them into nitro welded them together and put them back in the water with a crane and brought them to the boat club in one piece
2934686 used to be the club was wide open and people who werent members thought it was a little country club and theyd go down and have parties
2934687 when i became commodore in 1982 one of the first things i did was put up gates and have a secure place for people to have their boats
2934688 the annual rate for a 30 foot cruiser would be around 1 000 compared to 10 per month in 1957
2934689 the winter of 1978 i had a 25 foot criss boat that id just bought it only had 18 hours on it
2934690 one of our board members called me at 1 in the morning and said my boat had just burned up eleven boats were lost in that fire
2934691 i looked at the hull and the lines that were burned and i made up my mind that i would buy another boat
2934692 the fire was caused by gasoline in the water someone lit a match to melt the end of a rope to keep it from fraying and tossed the match in the water
2934693 all that was left of my boat was the bottom
2934694 the fire warped the door of the refrigerator in the dockhouse and melted a case of empty glass coca cola bottles
2934695 they had to separate the docks into two sections to give them the room they needed
2934696 people on the upper end came in one way and the lower end got used to the lower level we put in a new gunnel once it was over with so it turned out to be a good thing for the club
2934697 charleston boat club anchored in 70 years of river history

2934721 it is a phenomenal achievement he came in when murali muttiah muralitharan needed support and he rose to the occasion well
2934722 he has gone beyond our expectations and the important thing for him is to keep learning
2934723 its disappointing that we have not performed as a batting unit these are the guys who have won games for india its just a matter of not clicking i dont know how it happened

2934725 im really proud of her adlington im proud of both of them to be able to watch an olympic gold medal for great britain
2934726 the medal around my neck was my motivation i couldnt see anyone past katie
2934727 i didnt know what was going on over that side of the pool so i saw katie and it was just lets try and catch her and keep with her and thats what i did
2934728 i dont think either of us expected it especially two british girls on the podium and especially gold and bronze
2934729 that race was just completely different we did go slower than we did last night in the heats and it was just about racing and we did that
2934730 i dont think either of us are natural front end swimmers we dont do the 100 free so we are just naturally suited to the back end of the race i dont think either of us panics if in the first 100 were a little bit behind
2934731 its a great result to get on the podium its just amazing im so happy for both of us and its great for british swimming
2934732 theres different swimmers the 800 is completely different event but im really confident going into it and its just about the next two days and getting some recovery and rest and getting ready for it
2934733 this is definitely the best british team weve ever had and we just keeping getting stronger and stronger and weve proved that were a nation to look out for now
2934734 you may hear many dates but really i caution you to not pick any of these dates until you get the final document

2934778 we were in the gymnasium and i asked him bryant if i could have my photograph taken with him
2934779 he replied by asking about my hamstring injury and said that i was in his heart i didnt know what to expect from approaching him
2934780 i was so excited that i rang my mother and said kobe asked me about my leg
2934781 the other night at the opening ceremony there were all these people chanting kobe kobe and i said to one of the coaches i want to get closer to him so i will be on television and he said dont worry about it kid
2934782 thats crazy and he said hes coming to the track to see how i go
2934783 i get sleepy at 7 oclock i have been to the opening ceremony in sydney and was in a foul mood by the time 5 oclock came along

2934785 i just choose not to stay in the village because i like privacy and i dont want people around me and all that other stuff

2934788 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2934789 we need to stop hostility we dont need further military action we need to stop it we need to bring back peace and a cease fire is about both sides
2934790 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2934791 that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2934795 and we hear it but we dont hear it with the clarity that we used to
2934796 but i dont think its a problem at all for the winery
2934797 they can afford to charge the prices they do because of the intimacy you take the same artist and you pay them just a little bit more to play shoreline its hard to sell 20 000 seats the profit margin is there at the winery even though you may be paying the artist 100 000 or 150 000

2934823 it takes about 3 minutes for that to happen theres this veiled hatred
2934824 weve gotten to the age where we dont feel like fighting anymore because the end is a lot closer than the beginning

2934826 we work very closely with the different departments of the museum to have the tree come to life
2934827 we love doing it every year and its a chance to draw attention to the art form
2934828 we made sure its not just a parade of dinosaurs
2934829 we set about creating a story using our theater background that would make the audience feel some kind of personal connection with these creatures
2934830 id seen the bbcs tv series and thought no way this isnt going to work
2934831 it was just amazing even in the warehouse with fluorescent lights this thing looked unbelievable
2934832 theyre legendary even though dinosaurs were obviously real they fulfill our desire for magic as well

2934838 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
2934839 that is a simplified argument it is much more complicated than that
2934840 it is because silly malstrom the core buy all the games they are too strong look at their numbers how can anything disrupt that
2934841 blah blah blah all you do is repeat yourself blah blah blah do you know how many polygons the new video cards can do of course not did you see my cool neon blue lights on my computer you will be amazed
2934842 no not true the hd systems are perfect for pc gamers who dont want to shell out thousands of dollars for a computer they get to play all the latest pc games with full online and on the couch yeah they dont get to use a mouse but that is one sacrifice to make voice chat has replaced keyboard text anyway hd consoles were a bargain for pc gamers who didnt want to upgrade
2934843 hello malstrom where have you been there has been a great pc gamer migration to the hd consoles all the great pc games are coming out on consoles now outside of mmorpgs rtses and other strategy games
2934844 and they make pc games um more accessible there is no reconfiguring the computer to play a pc game on the dongle the controller is always the same so no confusion about keyboards and mouse
2934845 shhh dont tell anyone i like to pretend i am hardcore but the truth is that the real hardcore games are on the pc the dongles are casualizing the pc games dumbing it down for us but dont tell anyone it would hurt my image
2934846 so you are saying my precious pc gaming market which couldnt move upmarket anymore became a sitting duck for consoles that were still moving upmarket is that how consoles were able to cannibalize pc gaming
2934847 but if i am doing all the work for you what is the point of this post
2934848 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

2934860 i had enough of people trying to hurt me and harass me
2934861 ill probably have to do it myself but i want to see all forms of bullying made illegal
2934862 we have harassment through telephone in the criminal code we have harassing people by letters we say the criminal code is silent on new technology
2934863 the laws in the criminal code were all written years ago lets update it where its necessary
2934864 id be very careful about making online bullying a crime
2934865 the most severe forms of cyberbullying are already captured in the criminal code
2934866 we do have freedom of expression in canada and that means sometimes you can say unpopular and even nasty things and there is a line thats crossed
2934867 that line is already in the criminal code and im not quite sure why we need a specific law targeting the internet
2934868 as someone who has been bullied for 11 1 2 years im not sure how you can express yourself through bullying
2934869 its something that should have been done a long time ago
2934870 if you can get charged for bullying physically you should be able to get charged in regards to the form of cyberbullying
2934871 when i brought it up with the school i kept a copy of the chat log where they threatened me
2934872 they said there were no charges that could be laid because it was online if it had happened in person they could have pressed charges that was one time when i was let down by the justice system
2934873 i know that they dont believe in criminalizing it alone

2934876 there are only four approved ingredients known to block uva rays
2934877 many of the larger companies use avobenzone as a uva blocker
2934878 if youre relying on avobenzone to block uva its a trust issue
2934879 oxybenzone is a concern because it is readily absorbed by the skin and has hormone disruptive effects
2934880 we know for sure that uva rays can cause cancer
2934881 you need to apply sunscreen every few hours to be effective and you dont want to put bug repellent on that often

2934979 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2934980 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2934981 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2934982 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2934983 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2934984 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies

2934989 i n 1957 werd ik opgepakt na een bescheiden feestje bij mij thuis hier in brussel
2934990 een niet ge nviteerde had de politie verteld dat ik een minderjarige geld zou hebben aangeboden volledig uit de lucht gegrepen maar ik bracht wel een hele dag door op het justitiepaleis in afwachting van mijn verhoor werd ik in een kamertje opgesloten ik heb toen alle blaadjes van mijn nochtans lijvige adresboekje verorberd om mijn vrienden en kennissen niet in moeilijkheden te brengen ik ben een fijnproever en tussen haakjes ik vind dat je in brussel lekkerder kunt eten dan in om het even welke stad van west europa maar d maaltijd vergeet ik nooit
2934991 de officier die mij ten slotte ondervroeg was best sympathiek
2934992 na het verhoor hebben rijkswachters mijn appartementje in de ijzerenkruisstraat doorzocht en ook mijn kleerkast om na te gaan of er geen kledingstukken van anderen hingen dat zou erop wijzen dat er iemand bij mij overnachtte ze trokken een grote lade open en toen stond mijn hart stil die lade stak letterlijk boordevol brieven vijftig jaar geleden schreef je vaker naar elkaar e mail bestond natuurlijk niet en bellen zeker internationaal was duur en nederlanders schrijven sowieso meer dan vlamingen en brusselaars daar lag dus mijn hele priv correspondentie met namen en adressen mijn amoureuze en andere verzuchtingen de man keek er even naar en concludeerde als we daaraan moeten beginnen dan hebben we veertien dagen werk en hij schoof de lade dicht
2934993 nu betreur ik het dat mijn hele archief foldertjes uitnodigingen en meer door een overstroming verloren zijn gegaan die documenten zouden een mooi overzicht geven van een facet van het uitgaansleven van een halve eeuw geleden
2934994 haar zakenpartner had een door de pokken verwoest gelaat ik zag hem eens aan de toog van een caf in de marollen dat baa den bult au bossu heette de eigenaar had ook metterdaad een bochel en de twee caf bazen allebei niet meteen moeders mooiste raakten aan de praat de ene keek ongegeneerd naar de bochel van de andere en zei ik vraag me nu al heel van mijn leven af wat daarin zit de repliek liet geen fractie van een seconde op zich wachten daar zit mastiek in om de gaten in uw gezicht mee dicht te plamuren en dat allemaal zonder enige stemverheffing ze spreken vaak over de typisch nederlandse radheid en gevatheid maar sinds ik in 1948 in brussel neerstreek sta ik in bewondering voor de unieke brusselse humor rauw maar zo echt
2934995 in de getrouwheidsgang zat le canard sauvage waar ik voor de eerste maal travestieten zag optreden een primeur voor belgi of toch bijna enkele meters verderop hadden de lesbiennes the black swan als belangrijkste trefplaats een vriendin uit nederland een heel keurige dame ontmoette op de expo een vlaamse en het klikte nogal tussen hen na het expo bezoek vroeg de vlaamse aan mijn vriendin zullen we een pot pakken tot l verbijsterd was ze in nederland is pot een scheldnaam later tot een geuzennaam ge volueerd voor een vrouw die op seksegenoten valt zij dacht werkelijk dat haar nieuwe vlam voorstelde om een mooi meisje te kidnappen om dan weet ik veel wat voor fantasie n in de praktijk te brengen
2934996 toen absoluut n relatief de grootste homo organisatie ter wereld
2934997 mijn familie woonde veilig in nederland en wist niets van mijn avonturen de anonimiteit van brussel gaf me bewegingsvrijheid ik manifesteerde me niet als zodanig zoals dat heette

2935003 temples are so separated from society today but thanks to this high tech system people have turned their attention to the buddhist memorial service

2935011 als toeristische attractie zijn we de derde in brussel na mini europa en het atomium dat is allemaal gebaseerd op omzetcijfers we hebben de laatste jaren ook heel wat gerenoveerd en vernieuwd en dat was ook wel nodig oceade is volgens mij toch h t zwembad in brussel
2935012 zo heeft onder andere de hal een nieuw decor gekregen is heel het park in cara bische stijl aangekleed en is er ook een eigen mascotte gekomen captain o er zijn de laatste jaren ook een paar nieuwe attracties bijgekomen het aqua fun house is een interactieve speelzone met waterspelletjes de bounty raft is de eerste duo bandenglijbaan in belgi en met het interactieve spel caribbean madness worden de bezoekers gefilmd en kunnen ze zelf piraat spelen op het scherm het cara bische thema geeft de mensen ook meer een vakantiegevoel
2935013 wij zijn een dag en namiddagwaterpark aqualibi en sunparks hanteren een andere formule daarbij zijn wij in belgi uniek omdat we de meeste glijbanen hebben twaalf ts de snelste de langste en de grootste

2935080 the rogue employers who underpay the minimum wage deserve zero tolerance the minimum wage is making a real difference to the lives of many low paid migrant workers and we must continue to crack down on those mean bosses not paying their staff the legal wage to which they are entitled
2935081 the tucs commission on vulnerable employment heard many complaints from migrant workers including excessively long hours no contract and a complete lack of health and safety training
2935082 unions are stepping up their efforts to organise migrant workers to stop employers from using a poor grasp of english or ignorance of uk employment law as an excuse to treat people badly
2935083 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2935084 as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people
2935085 we are far away from home and we live in a strange area
2935086 this is a nice place to live and we have been here for 15 years but seeing all the police activity has brought back memories of wesley
2935087 i heard him say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown

2935089 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government
2935090 we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills
2935091 with high fuel prices the coming winter will be difficult for many families and we are committed to supporting them
2935092 the government is continuing to consider the best ways of meeting this challenge
2935093 no decisions on any new measures have yet been taken
2935094 labour needs to be on the side of ordinary voters huge swathes of whom are union members wanting to see less appeasement of business people who do not and never will vote labour
2935095 these new figures are truly alarming and confirm that diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges facing the uk today there are currently 2 3 million people diagnosed with diabetes and more than half a million people are unaware they have the condition
2935096 good self management awareness and improved access to specialist diabetes care services are crucial if we are to curb this growing health crisis and see a reduction in the number of people dying from diabetes and complications attributed to the condition

2935103 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2935104 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2935105 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2935106 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2935107 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2935108 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2935109 i warn you not to be lenient with criminals because they do not respect lives these street committees must not be user friendly to criminals but that does not mean that you must kill just catch the criminals and hand them over to the police

2935114 we distinguish between those who cant pay and those who wont pay
2935115 it does not matter who you are if you do not pay we will cut your services
2935116 simply unacceptable that government departments should be contributing to the problem of unpaid debt that local councils face
2935117 the situation is likely to be worse in local municipalities
2935118 municipalities throughout the country are plagued by high levels of non payment for services
2935119 many of them are struggling to deliver quality services because of insufficient revenue to finance these services

2935127 i would like to congratulate paul henderson and concede that i am the opposition leader
2935128 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
2935129 i was quietly confident that if you speak in response to what you understand to be the needs of the community speak in terms that they can understand and provide them with a plan they will support you and i was always confident of that
2935130 i believe that the result that has been achieved is an endorsement for that kind of politics

2935170 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2935171 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2935174 there are only four approved ingredients known to block uva rays
2935175 many of the larger companies use avobenzone as a uva blocker
2935176 if youre relying on avobenzone to block uva its a trust issue
2935177 oxybenzone is a concern because it is readily absorbed by the skin and has hormone disruptive effects
2935178 we know for sure that uva rays can cause cancer
2935179 you need to apply sunscreen every few hours to be effective and you dont want to put bug repellent on that often

2935181 251 is worth seeing not only for its success at putting chongs dubious
2935182 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2935183 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2935184 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2935185 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2935186 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2935187 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2935188 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2935189 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2935190 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2935191 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2935192 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2935193 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2935194 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2935195 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2935196 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2935197 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2935198 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2935199 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2935200 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2935201 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2935202 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2935203 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2935204 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2935205 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2935206 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2935207 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2935208 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2935209 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2935210 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2935211 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2935212 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2935213 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2935214 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2935215 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2935216 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2935217 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2935218 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2935219 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2935220 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2935221 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2935222 who are open to doing something on the production side
2935223 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2935224 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2935225 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2935226 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2935227 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2935228 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2935229 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2935230 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2935231 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2935232 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2935233 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2935234 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2935235 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2935236 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2935237 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2935238 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2935239 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2935240 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2935241 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2935242 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2935243 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2935244 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2935245 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2935246 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2935247 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2935248 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2935249 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2935250 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2935251 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2935252 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2935253 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2935254 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2935255 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2935256 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2935257 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2935258 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2935259 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2935260 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2935261 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2935262 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2935263 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2935264 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2935411 i really do like the fact that no other european has won two majors consecutively though because obviously i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2935412 to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
2935413 i actually struggle with things that are comfortable its something that i work with with sports psychologist bob rotella im better off i definitely have a little bit of i want to be fighting it
2935414 and thats why i have done well when things like this week when im not quite on my game ive won many a tournament where i felt i wasnt swinging as well as i could and performed poorly sometimes when i felt i was swinging well
2935415 so im a bit a little bit of a contrast like that but im getting better as i said at the open championship i did it when i felt good about my game and that was important to me
2935416 its a fascinating thing this week that i definitely didnt have my golf swing
2935417 my co ordination was out all week on thursday and friday i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough my game was going downhill very quickly out on the golf course
2935418 when i went back and had a look at it and had a discussion with my trainer at home it was possible that i was dehydrated and thats what caused the lack of co ordination
2935419 so it gave me something to focus on i focused on friday evening and saturday and all through saturday and sunday in rehydrating myself and at least whether that was the cause or not whether it was it might have been tiredness as well
2935420 but at least i had something tangible that i could actually pin it on and try and put some effort into it and give me the belief that if i can get my hydration right basically my co ordination would come back and whether it was the answer or not it certainly helped me focus on something and that was the important part of it
2935421 we are looking at 2 5 lakh tonnes of additional capacity through debottlenecking
2935422 the dollar has been strengthening due to a deterioration in economic data outside of the u s coupled with low oil prices
2935423 the key elements of this equities rebound are the drop in both the euro and oil prices
2935424 im sommer ist es nicht ganz so schlimm dann beginnt und endet die arbeit im hellen
2935425 several dozen russian bombers are in the georgian skies and have been attacking throughout the country over the past several hours
2935426 7 ingevolge artikel 1 onder 8 en artikel 8 eerste lid aanhef en onder b van de verordening in onderlinge samenhang bezien is de omschrijving van de werkzame stof of van de samenstelling van werkzame stoffen van het gewasbeschermingsmiddel in de handelsvergunning bepalend voor het antwoord op deze vraag 8 in de handelsvergunning van 26 juli 2002 is in paragraaf iv de samenstelling van het gewasbeschermingsmiddel vermeld daarbij zijn als werkzame stoffen aangeduid cymoxanil en famoxadone hieruit blijkt dat de combinatie van deze twee werkzame stoffen als het in de handelsvergunning ge dentificeerde product moet worden beschouwd 9 niet in geschil is dat de handelsvergunning is verleend voor de combinatie van vorengenoemde twee werkzame stoffen voor dit product heeft verweerder aan eiseres een abc verleend voor een andere productomschrijving zoals bijvoorbeeld famoxadone is geen handelsvergunning gevraagd of verkregen 10 het betoog van eiseres dat het product niet op basis van de handelsvergunning maar aan de hand van de ruimere omschrijving in het octrooi moet worden gedefinieerd gaat voorbij aan artikel 3 van de verordening
2935427 it has been confirmed to be found in the blast site
2935428 the discovery was made in the time frame we had hoped to be able to open it we were in the position where we had to take safety precautions for the people going back into their homes and not allow them back until we were certain it was safe
2935429 when i first arrived here i had a different expectation
2935430 i thought i would be a full time student but i have to work to pay my rent and send money to my family
2935431 if there was no food in the store we can find food in the forest here you cannot find food in the forest
2935432 when i was in my village i hear of america
2935433 but i thought america was a plane when i would see a plane fly by in the sky i ask the elders what is that and they say that is america so i think america is a plane
2935434 even if he runs for the u s he is still sudanese we are still proud of him
2935435 alla m ste boka en resa till turkiet nu nu nu
2935436 ta allting s vi kan komma h rifr n n gon g ng
2935437 if i went out and told them to stop theyd pelt this car
2935438 in fact i had my windscreen put in a couple of months ago but what can you do
2935439 we challenged them and we told them what was wrong then they started throwing stones and bottles at us
2935440 i realised we were all at risk ourselves because these guys were all drunk and i got my car around in time to watch them all running behind us throwing stones and bottles
2935441 if we hadnt moved the car it would have been smashed up and one or both of us would have been seriously injured
2935442 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2935443 women and children in the older city areas are very scared the monkeys are violent and each day we receive numerous complaints
2935444 so many foreign tourists have been attacked and bitten by the monkeys but the authorities do nothing to stop them from proliferating
2935445 we have made two of the three tracks operational and are clearing long distance trains delayed following the blockage of tracks
2935446 the allegations are absurd and baseless every penny that we got in aid since 2001 has been accounted for
2935447 not been passing on all the 1 billion a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
2935448 the army has been getting between 250 and 300 million reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2935449 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700 million dollars a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2935450 i think he has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future
2935451 het verbieden van discussies over beveiligingslekken is schadelijk voor het functioneren van beveiligingsonderzoekers en heeft niet alleen een nadelig effect op bekendmaking maar ook of dit soort belangrijk onderzoek in de eerste plaats wel wordt uitgevoerd waarbij dit soort acties de wetenschappelijke vooruitgang behoorlijk belemmert
2935452 i havent taken the cheque i want my land back or land of the same quality within two km of my residence
2935453 why should i give up my one bigha let the government shell out double the price it had offered
2935454 it is my fathers property i will not sell it even if someone offers me one crore for an acre
2935455 the wbidc babus arent giving any assurance the tatas and other industries are taking people through service providers how do we fit in
2935456 ask the policemen who signal these youths after sundown and allow them to take out materials for a price
2935457 there are 160 graduates in the area if you take at least two or three of them the process can be eased out
2935458 the case is ideal for compensation under the kutumb arth sahaya yojna family financial support scheme for needy a state government run scheme
2935459 ah the japanese they are so fond of the upcoming windows vista service pack 1 that they printed toilet paper rolls about it highlighting its features
2935460 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2935461 the lord of the rings the return of the king
2935462 all my life i could never say anything about that to anybody
2935463 i held it in for 80 years because my mother told me if youre in mexico they will kill you
2935464 he hadnt been there since he was 14 years old when he went back to mexico alone to look for information about his father
2935465 i really wasnt certain what wed find there what the reaction would be if we went there
2935466 we had a map of the area in our rental car but we didnt need it
2935467 my father could tell exactly where we were and where we needed to go just by looking at the mountains even after 70 years he knew the landscape
2935468 i didnt know if we should tell anybody who he was but my father said im an old man now
2935469 so the first person we told was a janitor at our hotel
2935470 it was very emotional to go back there after 70 years
2935471 not surprisingly this focus has resulted in a club whose demographics more closely reflect those of the city of cupertino
2935472 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2935473 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2935474 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2935475 theyd say oh no no no they wanted to walk on their own
2935476 people are aggressive theyre mean and they dont respect the lights
2935477 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2935478 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2935479 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2935480 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2935481 it just seemed that it would be useful to someone somewhere
2935482 any enhancement to our gis that provides additional relevant info to our response crews is obviously a benefit
2935483 theres probably 10 things we can do with the data were not even aware of yet
2935484 theres a system you enter and you find out if there are opportunities to do something that hasnt been done before
2935485 in this way each photo was accurately attached to its corresponding parcel in the citys online database
2935486 look here a train taking people to work and over there some people having a swim
2935487 5 in a half 5 in a half is a challenge i give myself every time ive been away from the camera too long it seems like a simple task take just 5 pictures within a half mile or kilometer no need to do the conversion math of your home i say it seems simple but in this digital age its sometimes harder to take just 5 pictures make each picture unique in some way be it subject matter camera angle exposure settings this task is great when following the first tip on taking a walk as chances are you spotted something on your way back to the house that might make a good photo the boot at left was a castaway along side the road that ive been meaning to shoot for a while nothing spectacular but it got the camera into my hand and turned on my creative mind to look for more content
2935488 a novel idea would have been to tell the truth
2935489 they could have said were grocery store inspectors were gasoline inspectors they could have named any number of lies that would not be criminal
2935490 when i first arrived here i had a different expectation
2935491 i thought i would be a full time student but i have to work to pay my rent and send money to my family
2935492 if there was no food in the store we can find food in the forest here you cannot find food in the forest
2935493 when i was in my village i hear of america
2935494 but i thought america was a plane when i would see a plane fly by in the sky i ask the elders what is that and they say that is america so i think america is a plane
2935495 even if he runs for the u s he is still sudanese we are still proud of him
2935496 nobody knows the horrific pain you go through when you lose a child
2935497 grief isnt something you get over its something you go through it becomes a part of you
2935498 you think of all the memories and you cant help but cry
2935499 ive spent the last 14 years trying to find a way out of darkness
2935500 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
2935501 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
2935502 while coleman natural beef is a relatively small supplier for whole foods market we are extremely disappointed that we must now question colemans assurances
2935503 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
2935504 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
2935505 ill always look for robles with the times hes run this year as consistent as hes been as fluent as hes been
2935506 hes obviously had a very hard time losing his world record and theres immense pressure on him on his home turf
2935507 this was the most exciting event everybody in china and the world was looking forward to this
2935508 its been such a long time ive been disappointed we havent been able to repeat it the last olympic victory
2935509 we were in tears up there but at least we didnt have a camera on us
2935510 its the most emotional swimming meeting ive been in since adrians gold and this eclipses it
2935511 the whole team is absolutely buzzing over it its mind blowing
2935512 looking back in the last 20 years weve had four womens finalists full stop and all of a sudden youve got a gold and a bronze
2935513 for her to win that one first the thing is how she now takes that on i thought the 400 would be a bit beyond her
2935514 thats a great mark of somebody whos going to go places she really wants to improve improve improve
2935515 all it needed was a look at her mental attitude because some swimmers cave in under pressure when i saw her and heard her interview i knew she could do it
2935516 i think bill sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and lottery funding weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits
2935517 there is a lot on the line at the olympic games you spend four years preparing for six seconds in the circle
2935518 i needed to see the film to make sure it was a foul it was right and i apologised temporary moments of insanity are ok
2935519 a gold medal is the ultimate validation of an athletics career in our sport and hearing the national anthem played in my name would be more powerful than the medal itself
2935520 but if i dont win it then its not going to change the way i look back on my career you dont do this for the medals and people who do are not usually that successful
2935521 if i perform to the best of my ability then i have achieved my goal if that gets me silver then thats fine with me if someone throws 22 something and beats me i can live with that its when i dont perform and lose when i get annoyed and frustrated
2935522 we know we are the best in the world and expect to do well
2935523 weve had chances to do that in recent olympic games and world championships and its eluded us we are all ready for some big performances we just need to go and execute
2935524 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2935525 ive only been shooting this for the past two years so i definitely didnt expect to do this so early in my career this is an incredible blessing
2935526 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2935527 it comes down in the end to buses vs books and our mission is to educate children
2935528 weve paid up to 4 36 a gallon for diesel at a bulk rate this time last year it was 3
2935529 we are not subsidized by the state and theres not even a state budget
2935530 we dont know how much money well have do we stop busing altogether do we go with a reduction in routes every dollar that fuel goes up comes out of our general fund do we pay for gas instead of pencils
2935531 they see 327 and they dont want to pay it
2935532 but they dont think of the savings in the long run in terms of their own gas
2935533 three hundred dollars is a lot of money particularly at the moment
2935534 he has a lot of after school activities now and sometimes the bus schedule doesnt work out its cheaper for him to take the bus than for me to drive him but i end up driving a lot anyway
2935535 the level of the intimacy is probably one of the most unusual among any venues in the country
2935536 the premium prices put it into a certain level of entertainment
2935537 because were serving that area down in the valley thats more affluent than most
2935538 and we hear it but we dont hear it with the clarity that we used to
2935539 but i dont think its a problem at all for the winery
2935540 they can afford to charge the prices they do because of the intimacy you take the same artist and you pay them just a little bit more to play shoreline its hard to sell 20 000 seats the profit margin is there at the winery even though you may be paying the artist 100 000 or 150 000
2935541 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2935542 we need to stop hostility we dont need further military action we need to stop it we need to bring back peace and a cease fire is about both sides
2935543 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2935544 that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2935545 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2935546 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2935547 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2935548 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2935549 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2935550 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2935551 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2935552 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2935553 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2935554 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2935555 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2935556 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2935557 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2935558 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2935559 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2935560 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2935561 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2935562 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2935563 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2935564 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2935565 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2935566 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2935567 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2935568 no one was seriously injured but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
2935569 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats people got scared and ran it was chaotic
2935570 it makes things a little more difficult its like another way of saying we dont appreciate what you do said charlie flisser a teacher at public school 112 in the bronx
2935571 to cut it back to save a couple bucks its disheartening
2935572 we tried to keep as much of teachers choice as possible
2935573 at the end of the day keeping the staffing intact became the priority
2935574 i can assure you hand on heart that i know nothing of this whatsoever
2935575 i think the national party is trying to divert this on to who did it
2935576 the new zealand government calls on all parties to exercise restraint we call for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations to end the conflict
2935577 british representatives on the ground and the media have reported that russia has extended the fighting today well beyond south ossetia attacking the georgian port of poti and the town of gori while abkhaz forces have been shelling georgian positions in the upper kodori valley i deplore this
2935578 it will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times
2935579 we are in the government now and have access to many previously confidential documents
2935580 sufficient severity to interfere with the some aspects of life
2935581 why does my company need to do press releases how will press releases benefit my seo campaign
2935582 why does my company need to do press releases how will press releases benefit my seo campaign

2935587 this acquisition will form the basis of london minings new coal division which we hope to grow rapidly in the future
2935588 we are particularly excited about entering into the coal business due to the strong demand from steel making and power generation that has resulted in major price increases this year in a similar manner to iron ore
2935589 dmc energy has also secured an irrevocable 40 metric ton per annum port allocation through the future porto du bella vista port in mozambique and is in the process of acquiring additional coal exploration assets in botswana zimbabwe and swaziland from dmc
2935590 rietkuil is being fast tracked into production and the other projects have substantial export potential through the new port in mozambique

2935603 men sen r det kunderna sj lva som inte byter fast de ofta r missn jda det finns en del vanf rest llningar om att det r komplicerat att byta bank och att man bara ska ha en bank det finns ocks fortfarande en sorts underd nig inst llning till banker generellt sett

2935617 una posizione sostiene il titolare della farnesina che sarebbe molto negativa per leuropa tutta
2935618 se kouchner di rientro dalla sua missione presenter la proposta mercoled al consiglio dei ministri degli esteri dei 27 e se dovesse passare la prenderemo in considerazione
2935619 da subito precisa il ministro sono pronti gli aiuti umanitari allossezia del sud
2935620 oltre 1 500 uomini armati pesantemente e bene equipaggiati delle brigate speciali di polizia si stanno concentrando in quella zona ha detto un portavoce allagenzia la richiesta di deporre le armi stata fatta per evitare una escalation inaccettabile del confronto armato tenendo presente la possibilit di provocazioni violente da parte georgiana
2935621 se lultimatum respinto tutte le necessarie misure di rinforzo saranno attuate

2935623 these positive sampling results are the latest of several highly promising indicators of our singida gold propertys potential to host an economically significant resource base our concessions lie directly adjacent to and along strike from shanta gold limiteds singida project where initial exploration drilling has identified an indicated resource of 543 000 ounces of gold worth an estimated 500 million third party aerial magnetic surveys have highlighted possible gold anomaly hot zones and drill targets on our property and small scale operations by local artisan miners indicate ore grade gold mineralization on the surface
2935624 based on these factors vipr believes additional exploration of the singida gold propertys potential is warranted we are gearing up to move into the next phase of exploration preparing a strategy and budget for our discussions with potential investors and partners we are extremely pleased with the projects initial results and believe our singida operations will have a major impact on the companys growth

2935632 the fall in wealth will mean that uk household spending growth is likely to slow to just 0 5 in 2009
2935633 however that will not be enough in itself to push the uk into recession we are sailing pretty close to recession but it will take something else to push us over the edge
2935634 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook

2935639 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them this audit shows that the exceptional cases process is in chaos and patients are suffering
2935640 we urge the government to end this bizarre and demeaning lottery
2935641 the whole system of exceptional requests for cancer treatment leads to serious risks of injustice for patients

2935651 were not getting hit nearly as hard by the high gas price as the bigger rv makers
2935652 theres no rhyme or reason to it but were having our best year ever
2935653 logic would dictate lower sales given the gas price and i was worried about that at the beginning of the year
2935654 you hear the odd person complain about the price of gas but people are still interested
2935655 they scoff at 1 35 a litre when theyre used to paying a lot more than us back home
2935656 its a big ticket item and the demographic is mainly 50 plus but we do get some families too
2935657 from a total industry perspective i can see sales taking a hit down the road when you look at the average 200 litre rv tank it can be pretty pricey and lets face it gm is laying off workers in oshawa because their trucks arent selling
2935658 when you have more than 70 of 140 vehicles show up to the park thats pretty good

2935690 we hebben het aantal mensen per vliegtuig niet verminderd het klopt wel dat er door onvoorziene omstandigheden soms iets minder personeel is bijvoorbeeld als vliegtuigen vertraging hebben of naar zaventem worden afgeleid

2935735 we did not have many chances but we managed to score on setpieces
2935736 even when we led 3 0 we stayed focused until the end
2935737 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2935738 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2935739 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2935740 they were real trusting and loving and outright but they were aware that stuff happens this is just a freak thing
2935741 they were really getting into the arts and crafts of guatemala
2935742 he said you know im agnostic on the science and im agnostic on the politics
2935743 we were yelling and clapping our hands and he would not leave the area he was not in fear
2935744 we followed him for about two blocks and he was walking the neighborhood knocking over garbage cans and looking for food
2935745 you hear in the news a lot about all these bear attacks but i dont hike in the woods so i didnt think it pertained to me
2935746 the chances of running into that bear are slim to none unless she charges us
2935747 for a few days well walk the trail and see if that happens
2935748 and then wed have a sow who is just wild
2935749 so youd get beat up by the bear for the next five or 10 minutes
2935750 its not something a lot of people would be standing in line to do walk with your finger on the safety for two or three hours and your head on a swivel
2935751 we came across one grouse and we all had our guns trained on it

2935753 we ve got a big problem in britain we re addicted to debt and we are seeing the consequences of that as the credit crunch hits and everyone is finding it more and more difficult with the rising cost of living
2935754 the majority of people will just be in negative equity
2935755 jobs growth in scotland remains relatively firm despite a moderating in market conditions since last summer
2935756 this is an excellent solution to eliminate credit card debt as long as you do not begin using your credit card again to finance purchases otherwise your credit card debt will begin to accumulate once again and you will end up in a worse situation than before

2935759 demonstrated the extent to which household finances are being stretched as well as a reflection of the increased price of risk now incorporated into mortgage rates
2935760 unless this changes the young and job movers will have difficulties finding somewhere decent to live
2935761 the credit squeeze will back some consumers into a corner and in sheer desperation people will resort to lying about their salaries as this is such an easy loophole to exploit
2935762 the rising cost of living is not the only reason for this growth more expensive mortgages help explain why more homeowners are taking out ivas
2935763 we anticipate that the number of new ivas opened in england and wales will continue to increase in 2008
2935764 the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better
2935765 for those going through repossession you must get advice and get someone to represent you if you are facing a repossession hearing this really can make all the difference don t put your head in the sand
2935766 with the credit crunch bringing spiralling living costs from fuel to food to interest rates families are seeing their budgets stretched to the limit
2935767 costs of living are seemingly on a constant increase now
2935768 so most of us are looking at ways of lowering our spending as much as we can that might include walking more eating out less spending less on leisure activities or maybe even selling our homes and downsizing
2935769 but lowering costs this way is especially difficult for the rising numbers of people in debt who have to cope with the rising costs of living and their often rising debt repayments when money is already tight managing debts may be an even bigger concern
2935770 but there are a number of debt solutions designed to help people in different situations
2935771 both debt management for example can lower monthly repayments as well as simplifying finances
2935772 its important to remember that lower monthly payments means paying for longer possibly paying more in the long run but at a time like this the most important thing is often making sure you can afford your monthly outgoings

2935789 to us thats us as kids and as sisters minus everything else it was nice to share that people think i dont like talking about kylie but that couldnt be further from the truth i understand why people ask about her
2935790 she is incredibly famous and loved by everyone so people want to know what it is like being her sister thats normal we are really different people so there has never been any competition

2935825 never ever give a lender a reason to say anything bad about you to the credit bureaus
2935826 dont ever use your credit report as a 10 percent off coupon at the mall

2935830 you could probably have been forgiven for expecting the aussie to trade slightly better but its probably more down to what the euro does and what the us dollar does at least in the short term
2935831 it does seem to be the case that the market has really moved on from watching us factors to watching european events and european data
2935832 traders are more concerned about the fact that the more negative european data that weve had out risks that we see more to come and the fact that the escalation in violence is very close to europes backyard
2935833 the results should allay any market concern that vision is overly exposed to weakening consumer confidence or downturn in private health insurance memberships

2935841 the level of the intimacy is probably one of the most unusual among any venues in the country
2935842 the premium prices put it into a certain level of entertainment
2935843 because were serving that area down in the valley thats more affluent than most
2935844 and we hear it but we dont hear it with the clarity that we used to
2935845 but i dont think its a problem at all for the winery
2935846 they can afford to charge the prices they do because of the intimacy you take the same artist and you pay them just a little bit more to play shoreline its hard to sell 20 000 seats the profit margin is there at the winery even though you may be paying the artist 100 000 or 150 000
2935847 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2935848 i must apologise again for deciding to come to live in england if i am fortunate enough i will return and die on thai soil just like other thais
2935849 has nothing to do with the preparation of the games
2935850 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the international olympic committee but i would refer to the politicians for that
2935851 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today
2935852 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2935853 we will not appeal her participation in the games what matters now is katerinas compensation
2935854 the thrust of this campaign was set months ago and is continuing forward theres no special plan to change that
2935855 to jackson this must have sounded a lot like a presidential candidate polishing his bona fides with white americans at the expense of black ones something he himself steadfastly refused to do even during his second presidential run in 1988 when he captured more votes than anyone thought possible
2935856 we have been flooded with appeals for davis to get recognition for the 1989 slaying of off duty savannah police officer mark macphail
2935857 obviously this was a different win today than the win at birkdale
2935858 i was very comfortable with my game there very happy about what i was doing
2935859 here it wasnt the case i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the golf club this week in terms of my focus or maybe dehydration or tiredness but something had me a little bit off my stride this week my coordination wasnt quite there
2935860 so once i got into the weekend and holed a few putts it really was a question of the adrenaline keeping me going keeping me focused keeping me pushing along
2935861 i went out this afternoon sunday not a 100 percent sure what lay ahead
2935862 as i said at birkdale i think i was quite assured of what i was doing here i really didnt know
2935863 so i kept to my game plan kept hitting my shots obviously as well as i felt i was doing obviously i was trailing sergio garcia from early on and the only thing from experience that i know is that in a major nobody goes without making some mistakes
2935864 so as long as i could hang in there i knew that i would get my opportunity and if it was going to be my day i would take that opportunity
2935865 i just kept in there and said look if i hang around i will get an opportunity and obviously that opportunity came
2935866 the goal is to get to the back nine in the last round and have the responsibility that its on your head whether you win or you dont win
2935867 you take the shots and you take the responsibility some days it wont go for you and you have to be prepared to handle that
2935868 but you got to be also prepared to take those shots on and take that responsibility and the consequences that go with it whether you take the opportunities or not
2935869 but youve got to know youve got to take them on on the back nine youre not going to win any other way
2935870 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years
2935871 and i probably still get asked am i the leading player in europe but its six years that ive probably maintained that arranging more or less
2935872 a couple of times i might have lost it but more or less for the close to six years
2935873 it is a big step now to move up now and start competing on a different level im world no 2 ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me
2935874 i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more to what im doing
2935875 do i believe i can improve as a player yes i do believe i can improve as a player theres plenty of my game to improve theres lots of stuff i can work on
2935876 and i am maturing as a player i have always been throughout my career i have been a learner in the game ive always applied myself looked for what would improve my game found that and worked on it to improve it and have improved it but its always taken some time
2935877 for many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
2935878 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me what im doing controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil
2935879 the kind of guy that gets the most out of me should have a big thick cock
2935880 hell eat my pussy to get me wet first then stuff me from on top and from behind slapping my ass while he shoves it in and out im bi but big cock is my first love i love sex and i need as much as possible

2935888 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2935889 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2935890 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2935891 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2935892 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2935893 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2935894 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2935895 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2935896 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2935897 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2935898 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said
2935899 i just want my boy back this is so hard and i hope he is lost somewhere amp squo amp squo said ms munohur who holds out hope that yadav is alive

2935903 der film hat alles zu bieten was einen bond streifen ausmacht die erwartungen nach dem erfolgreichen letzten film sind nat rlich riesig der druck f r den regisseur und auch f r mich ist deshalb immens aber unser einziges kriterium war es einen guten film zu machen so dass wir in zehn jahren darauf zur ckblicken und immer noch stolz sein k nnen
2935904 man muss den film in einer relativ kurzen zeit an den verschiedensten drehorten und mit komplexen handlungsstr ngen fertig stellen das geht nur schritt f r schritt dabei sehne ich nicht das ende der dreharbeiten herbei sondern ich denke immer nur an den aktuellen drehtag

2935908 it poured some cold water on the notion that they might start with some aggressive moves and really slash rates
2935909 they will cut rates in september probably by 25 basis points
2935910 they probably dont envisage to do a lot of cuts at this stage

2935965 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
2935966 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2935967 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2935968 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2935969 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
2935970 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
2935971 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
2935972 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
2935973 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2935974 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2935975 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
2935976 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
2935977 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

2935984 they were arrested on thursday and are currently in police custody the police are still investigating their case before we hand them over for prosecution
2935985 our role as rra is building and strengthening business partnerships with the business community we are ready to work with samba supermarket
2935986 the volunteers have doubled to 105 they are focusing on important areas to rwanda health education justice the private sector and particularly the kinyinya community centre
2935987 it is about sharing experiences learning from each other and supporting those who need support
2935988 once the project is up and running it is our duty to keep it running and add on to it and keep it in good condition so that it does not deteriorate
2935989 we have trained intensively since we arrived here and our focus has always been one to get that medal
2935990 they are many world stars here whom we chat and train with daily and it is upon us to show them that we are capable of
2935991 with the extension of the ictr the possibility of apprehending kabuga is very high
2935992 he was at first terminated from lecturing at bukavu catholic university and later at evangelical university of central africa
2935993 he pulled me closer because he knew i was hiding his false secrets but i could not accept hiding this
2935994 he has been using me as his personal secretary and when i requested him to increase on my salary he sacked me
2935995 forgery is a crime that is punished by the law
2935996 i heard about this case but we are still carrying investigations before taking actions
2935997 he presented his papers to us and they were notified so we are in touch with his former schools to get to the bottom of the matter
2935998 it is impossible that with experience of 22 years as a pilot i would deliberately crash the plane marwoto komar told a district court in yogyakarta central java
2935999 i didnt have any intention to carelessly do things to harm the passengers he said wearing his pilots uniform

2936004 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2936005 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2936006 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2936007 the message i have to the youths as we commemorate this years heroes day and defence forces day is to remain vigilant and guard jealously the gains of the liberation struggle we must remain united so that we do not give room to the countrys detractors who do not want to see us living together as a happy family
2936008 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2936009 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2936010 we describe a simple modular approach to programming molecular tube circumferences
2936011 single step annealing results in the self assembly of long tubes displaying monodisperse circumferences of 4 5 6 7 8 10 or 20 dna helices

2936014 the level of the intimacy is probably one of the most unusual among any venues in the country
2936015 the premium prices put it into a certain level of entertainment
2936016 because were serving that area down in the valley thats more affluent than most
2936017 and we hear it but we dont hear it with the clarity that we used to
2936018 but i dont think its a problem at all for the winery
2936019 they can afford to charge the prices they do because of the intimacy you take the same artist and you pay them just a little bit more to play shoreline its hard to sell 20 000 seats the profit margin is there at the winery even though you may be paying the artist 100 000 or 150 000

2936021 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
2936022 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
2936023 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
2936024 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
2936025 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
2936026 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
2936027 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2936028 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2936029 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2936030 when all of the judicial and appeal processes have exhausted themselves if any of the three are subject to a death penalty australia will make a plea of clemency on their behalf at that time
2936031 all legal avenues have not fully been exhausted thats why the question of clemency is not on the table yet

2936036 the wealth of a maasai man is measured by the number of his livestock wives and children in that order and unfortunately not by his ability to care for them
2936037 each wife spends her days tending to the homestead and preparing food women are occupied with running the maasai household gathering and chopping firewood collecting water preparing meals and feeding children with very little food repairing and maintaining their bomas personal huts and attending to the needs of their husbands these duties are somehow balanced with occasionally selling enough vegetables to earn a meagre income
2936038 the children had a keen hunger to learn that ive never seen before they know education is their way out of poverty some walk 1 1 2 hours to get to school im not sure where the desire comes from because the public school system fails them

2936044 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2936045 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with macs wife rhonda
2936046 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2936047 he was a lovely man but i was very young
2936048 i didnt know who i was and i was still struggling as an actor i was a terrible wife

2936051 id like to pay special praise to those two martin and brown they came in on deadline day and had a 30 minute training session on friday night but both came up with outstanding performances
2936052 i thought everyone played their part but two young kids came into a must win situation and came up with very mature performances
2936053 he was ruled out on friday night but when we got here adam robinson was ruled out so he had to play we had no other option
2936054 we put the three subs on and luckily it worked once they went on the pitch i thought we dominated and played the way i wanted us to play
2936055 i think danny whitaker was excellent when he came on we moved the ball quickly and took care of it
2936056 ive said to the lads all players have good games but if it doesnt go their way for some reason thats the thing about having a good squad i looked at the bench and thought i had some players to get me out of jail
2936057 deane smalley played 40 odd games last year but i left him out altogether its a problem but its a good one
2936058 id never name names but i said to people there was lots of sloppiness and i didnt like it
2936059 ive told them it wont get by me and its important stefan stam stays positive i know he wants to play he did very well last year and he needs to be ready when the time comes
2936060 we still should have had enough with 10 men to hang on

2936064 ive been here three years and i want to do better ill put pressure on myself by saying well do very well this year
2936065 i want us to go out and play the right tempo from the first whistle whether we do that is down to the lads on the pitch
2936066 i think ill be using two or three substitutions in every game because ive got players on the bench who are going to push the players in the team
2936067 its something ive thought of something that might benefit us im not really into rotation because i think that if a team wins and plays well you stick with it
2936068 last year though i looked at us and how some players were performing away from home compared with at home some looked different players because theyre outstanding at home and you dont see them away
2936069 its something ill look at but sometimes you win and win well and think why change it
2936070 cara bagaimana agar semua orang mengantri dan memohon untuk memberikan uang mereka pada kita
2936071 and its a spanish rider which shows that we have a problem in spain its time that spanish authorities start to do something concretely for years they have not been tough enough on doping and this is the result of their leniency
2936072 we just got it in they say clapton played one take it for a spin
2936073 i try to pretend that it can sound this good but the truth is it aint even in the neighborhood
2936074 im one of the five best known americans in the world
2936075 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized

2936136 bakit mo sinasabi sa akin yan ganyan talaga pero makakahanap ka rin ng babaeng magmamahal sa iyo ng totoo at hindi ka iiwan

2936139 i know that this happens for a fact in deobandi circles in fact jamia ashrafia in lahore has a halala centre this is where a man marries a woman and divorces her or sometimes does not divorce her but is fooled into thinking he has the deobandi maulvi will then draw up a contract where he or one of his mates will marry the woman for a specified time then return her to her original husband sometimes for a fee there are horror stories where a woman is passed around several moulvis before she gets to go back to her original husband

2936145 sadly the sun has set on the life of another true canadian son dear friend and soldier let us never forget his sacrifice
2936146 hes the kind of guy we would describe as a soldiers soldier and i know thats a coined phrase but in actual fact he was one of those real guys

2936149 ik ben geen dierenbeul ze hebben er drie dagen over gedaan de stalbaas in nederland heeft ze naar spanje gebracht hij heeft zijn stal grotendeels opgeheven en maakt er een managementsinstituut van heel bijzsonder dat wel management aan de hand van de omgang met paarden
2936150 die was zeker net zo erg als voor jullie reis naar rusland
2936151 gelukkig heb ik het niet hoeven doen eigenlijk heb ik er zelf niet veel werk aan gehad maar ja ik begrijp het allemaal wel jammer genoeg is papierwerk het enige middel tegen paardendiefstal over de overbrenging van ziekten
2936152 ze hadden te paard naar spanje kunnen gaan vierhonderd jaar geleden had je geen andere mogelijkhed gehad
2936153 in dat geval had ik er de harnassen helmen musketten en lansen bij moeten leveren we waren in oorlog met spanje

2936166 s lo es una ilusi n flotando en mi coraz n
2936167 we believe a male has shot a female in the car park and he has then turned the firearm on himself a police spokeswoman said
2936168 i just want my boy back this is so hard and i hope he is lost somewhere said ms munohur who holds out hope that yadav is alive
2936169 we are here for him he is not alone he has his father mother sisters and family in mauritius
2936170 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2936171 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2936172 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2936173 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2936174 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police said
2936175 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2936176 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2936177 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2936178 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2936179 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2936180 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said
2936181 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2936182 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2936183 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2936184 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2936185 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2936186 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2936187 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
2936188 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all
2936189 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2936190 but if i spend my whole life recovering then when does strength even have time to show its face
2936191 these tears are the product of a life time spent bearing and suffering under the true ignorance of society
2936192 because while you may let those words roll off your shoulders like droplets of water on a hot summer day eventually enough drops have fallen to soak your clothes and add a heavy yet recognizable weight its hard to move away when 50 pounds seem to cling to your existence constantly
2936193 you know what you are right that caramel skin cant fool me youre white washed an oreo youre all mixed up
2936194 there are no such things as white styles and black styles style shouldnt be associated with race i shouldnt be confined to the bars people have put up in the form of stereotypes and discomfort i shouldnt have to sacrifice my own creativity and personality to appease the general population and fit into their sugar coated jail cells i like me i wear what i want i listen to what i want because i am who i am doesnt make me any less black or white i choose to fly free
2936195 slit my wrists my blood does not bleed in black and white
2936196 nothing i dont base my worth on whether or not i have a man in my life
2936197 and where people go wrong is they dont know how to love themselves first and put that responsibility on the backs of other people other people cant be trusted with my own mental sanity with my love humanity isnt going to man handle my self esteem because humanitys standards are much different than mine
2936198 who gave you permission to get inside my head anyway
2936199 im just saying you seem to be messing up a lot lately this wouldnt be going on if she were around
2936200 my mother raised me for such a time as this and even though shes not here she left me with her god to show me what to do i just forgot how to ask
2936201 you dont know these people why make space in a space that already seems filled to the brim with your own needs your own thoughts your own hurt look out for you first
2936202 feeling the spirit of another suffering human being is the only thing that separates me from the spineless mass we call the public music is my weapon words follow close behind my heart bleeds for the shallow jesus is my guide
2936203 i dont have to know them it is my obligation as a person in a blessed land who thinks and feels and bleeds to respond at least emotionally to the hell humanity has dug itself into

2936207 the talks will resume today after that president mbeki will come back to south
2936208 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2936209 fourteen hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
2936210 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2936211 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2936212 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2936213 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2936214 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2936215 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties
2936216 as a result more people are being arrested and charged for carrying knives
2936217 that represents 88 of all of those arrested for this offence
2936218 the mps is making major improvements in charging people caught carrying knives with the charge rate having risen to over 90 in recent weeks
2936219 the mps will continue to monitor its performance and will maintain a positive charging policy to deter people from carrying knives on the streets of london
2936220 co ordinated enforcement activity is taking place a cross all 32 boroughs under blunt 2 and we are deploying a dedicated taskforce in the boroughs most affected
2936221 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2936222 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2936223 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2936224 i imagine it was a pretty horrific scene with two people getting struck by a vehicle and not stopping and continuing on
2936225 thats what were looking for once you find the vehicle thats the one piece of the puzzle
2936226 were trying to locate anyone connected with the driver were looking for the registered owner or anyone who had custody of the vehicle at that time
2936227 theyd say oh no no no they wanted to walk on their own
2936228 people are aggressive theyre mean and they dont respect the lights

2936231 it comes down in the end to buses vs books and our mission is to educate children
2936232 weve paid up to 4 36 a gallon for diesel at a bulk rate this time last year it was 3
2936233 we are not subsidized by the state and theres not even a state budget
2936234 we dont know how much money well have do we stop busing altogether do we go with a reduction in routes every dollar that fuel goes up comes out of our general fund do we pay for gas instead of pencils
2936235 they see 327 and they dont want to pay it
2936236 but they dont think of the savings in the long run in terms of their own gas
2936237 three hundred dollars is a lot of money particularly at the moment
2936238 he has a lot of after school activities now and sometimes the bus schedule doesnt work out its cheaper for him to take the bus than for me to drive him but i end up driving a lot anyway
2936239 nobody knows the horrific pain you go through when you lose a child
2936240 grief isnt something you get over its something you go through it becomes a part of you
2936241 you think of all the memories and you cant help but cry
2936242 ive spent the last 14 years trying to find a way out of darkness
2936243 the level of the intimacy is probably one of the most unusual among any venues in the country
2936244 the premium prices put it into a certain level of entertainment
2936245 because were serving that area down in the valley thats more affluent than most
2936246 and we hear it but we dont hear it with the clarity that we used to
2936247 but i dont think its a problem at all for the winery
2936248 they can afford to charge the prices they do because of the intimacy you take the same artist and you pay them just a little bit more to play shoreline its hard to sell 20 000 seats the profit margin is there at the winery even though you may be paying the artist 100 000 or 150 000
2936249 the way these things tend to go scare during the xmas rush
2936250 its the thrill of my life thats about it its hard to describe i just went for it i knew i was lying in fourth thankfully it went my way and i just went for it
2936251 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated
2936252 ive been through a lot of hardship and shed a lot of tears in the last four years there have been successes and failures
2936253 after 2004 my only aim has not changed i had so very much wanted to be a champion at the beijing olympics
2936254 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2936255 i wasnt thinking of making history i was two points behind the leaders i was just trying to shoot good shots i wanted to shoot well and shoot aggressively and thats what i did
2936256 it shows that shooting is a sport from the first to the final shot every one counts
2936257 i havent prayed so much in my life with the second last shot they tied together and then he bindra shot a 10 8 it couldnt have got better

2936262 we have evaluation teams always looking at issues well certainly take a look at this one all chips have errata and there could be an issue that needs to be checked possibly wed have to investigate his paper
2936263 i think if people are aware about bugs they will force intel to fix them
2936264 i was asked to not make poc code publicly available and i think this is a good point i was asked to not reveal tech info but i disagree because installing protections on the isp side will prevent all possible attack s revealing tech details will not cause chaos and mass attacks so im going to reveal a lot of but not all

2936271 im lucky really to have been able to live in different countries that could make me curious
2936272 i visited a school friend who was living in hong kong and i absolutely loved it the energy and the bustle were somehow similar to new york where id been spending a lot of time but it was also totally unlike anything else id known up until that point home had been wherever we were living but here was my first sense of foreignness i was taken with the idea that there was a quarter of humanity in one country and that i couldnt communicate with them
2936273 well i can speak it when it comes to discussing the contraction of aids but then ill have trouble remembering the word for spoon
2936274 the bureaux i was working in were very small and so i got to cover all sorts of stories
2936275 the countries i had worked in were three of the then five most populated in the world and i was not enjoying being stuck to a desk and decided to go learn something new
2936276 i did both for a while when i went back to vietnam writing reports and so on but then i just drifted more and more into the hiv work
2936277 what drew me in sex and drugs well im interested in politics and how the world works and aids brings these things together
2936278 effective epidemiology is not unlike investigative journalism the skill base is similar and so i was good at it
2936279 in epidemiology you look for the normal and i cannot tell you how many people have come up to me and said oh men in africa spread it by fucking virgins because they think it will cure them it drives me mad because that is not the reason why several million people on one continent have it
2936280 hiv is mostly about people doing stupid things in the pursuit of pleasure or money
2936281 africans have a lot of sex there ive said it
2936282 you only have to look at the experience of the uk or us gay communities where weve had more or less universal access to arvs antiretroviral drugs for at least eight or nine years and the number of new infections are rising
2936283 more people are living longer with hiv and there is what we call behavioural disinhibition fuck the condoms i dont need them any more because if hes positive hell be on drugs so he probably wont infect me and if i do get infected it would be annoying but not the end of the world
2936284 it has been interestingly essentially big noise but its a generalised sigh of relief ive been a bit of a drama queen but there are a lot in the industry that have said it for a long time its just ive packaged it in a different form
2936285 i dont think of myself as a campaigner or an activist there are lots of people working hard and are frustrated i just get impatient im probably better placed as well as a hack
2936286 i dont get how its ok to keep someone alive once theyre sick but not ok to stop them getting sick i just dont get that
2936287 oh and jason i figure someone astitute sic as you would have happened to notice the picture on the wall and noticed the large brutha in the kitchen i know there are a few of us in vancouver but in kits the number gets even smaller so how could i not be in charge you could even joke and say i could be the hnic head n word in charge but that wouldnt be polite but funny in a samuel jackson sort of way but i guess me being an authority figure was to sic much for you to comprehend
2936288 watch out or youll get called a racist as well
2936289 its really been equipment and training like protective gear for the local police departments or respirators for firemen or radios for part of the command center training for the command center stuff like that for operability and safety
2936290 this year its heavy on providing tools that will be used for preparedness and emergency response not so much investigations and counterterrorism

2936311 though we expect a continued deterioration as the year goes on as american and european consumers stay at home the resilience of demand for chinas exports is still remarkable
2936312 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2936313 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2936314 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2936315 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2936316 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2936317 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2936318 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2936319 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2936320 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2936321 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2936322 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2936323 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2936324 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2936325 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2936326 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2936327 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2936328 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2936329 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2936330 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2936331 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2936332 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2936333 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2936334 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2936335 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2936337 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2936338 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2936339 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2936340 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2936341 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2936342 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2936343 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2936344 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2936345 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2936346 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2936347 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2936348 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2936349 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2936350 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2936351 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2936352 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2936356 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2936357 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2936358 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2936359 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2936360 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2936361 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2936370 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2936371 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2936372 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2936373 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2936374 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2936375 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2936376 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2936377 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2936378 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2936379 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2936380 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2936381 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2936382 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2936383 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2936384 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2936399 i just want my boy back this is so hard and i hope he is lost somewhere said ms munohur who holds out hope that yadav is alive
2936400 we are here for him he is not alone he has his father mother sisters and family in mauritius
2936401 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2936402 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2936403 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2936404 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2936405 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2936406 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2936407 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2936408 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2936409 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2936410 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2936411 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said
2936412 its not just the short term impact on children and their families its the long term impact on the reputation of the city

2936417 the middle eastern sharia banking industry is one of the worlds great banking success stories and it is essential for arab bank to be supported by industry leading technology as we continue to further expand our services across the region
2936418 we are witnessing a rapid growth of the islamic finance market with sharia compliant products more in demand than ever before misys is working at the forefront of developing new functionality that underpins banks back office operations and this extension of our work with arab bank is an excellent example of how we add real value to our islamic banking clients

2936446 its a must win game for us as we prepare for the cup game against highlanders it will be a thrilling game lots of fireworks but in the end we must get all the points
2936447 we are not worried about the players gunners acquired last month we are in form and we will beat any side we face be it dynamos
2936448 i feel we had a good game but we missed a lot of chances but im happy with the way my boys played today its unfortunate that we lost the game
2936449 it was typical of a cup game because we created some chances and they had their own
2936450 i thought we controlled the first half but in the second half we were under pressure our defence didnt play well today and i think its because of the constant changes we are making
2936451 i have already got the four on my account and i am remaining with 26 goals to achieve my target of 30
2936452 i feel i can do it i am training hard to achieve my target and i know i will get to it
2936453 what alternatives are you considering as a result of high gas prices affecting your commute to work
2936454 if you want to help farmers the process should be clear otherwise how many farmers will have access to this money as a committee we cannot accept this proposal until further notice
2936455 we wanted to assist our farmers access cheap loans because these central banks consider them risky
2936456 this is why we are proposing this facility and we have put shs20 billion each year for this scheme
2936457 when you give this money to these commercial banks they will cheat our people through short term loans which are not beneficial to farmers
2936458 this facility is unsustainable and we dont want to lose public money as it was the case with tri star and other failed ventures
2936459 we are facing a development challenge that is why we want to help farmers because we cannot afford to create an agricultural bank now yet there is need for development
2936460 we emphasise vaccination of dogs as a priority because they unlike cows which do not bite can spread rabies to many people in a short time through their bites
2936461 were really excited about this milestone and want our most loyal fans to be a part of the evolution of playstation home
2936462 in europe scee is also beginning their expanded closed beta directly targeting consumers who have been most active on playstation network and playstation store
2936463 scee will be in email contact with their psn audience very shortly
2936464 men are urged to attend the show in large numbers as there is something special for them
2936465 farmers should also take this rare chance to meet another new exhibitor agritech which supplies tractors and grinding mills
2936466 transport costs have risen so much that farmers with fewer bales no longer see the point of transporting their produce to the floors
2936467 all of my grandparents immigrated sic here in the 20s from ireland
2936468 so i really dont have a dog in the slavery fight but when do i get my apology from england for trying to kill the irish catholics who would be my ancestors can i expect that anytime
2936469 african americans soon saw the fleeting political social and economic gains they made during reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
2936470 business leaders are increasingly finding that theyre at the sharp end of the credit crunch and need to take stock of how they run their organisations in order to get the best from their employees
2936471 in these tough financial times employers are facing a difficult challenge to keep their staff motivated with many trying to find low cost incentives to encourage and reward productivity
2936472 this win in addition to strengthening costains order book now over 2 billion pounds enhances its credentials in both waste resource management and alternative energy generation two attractive growth markets
2936473 costain continues to trade at a discount to its peers given the outlook this valuation seems too cheap in our view we reiterate our strong buy recommendation
2936474 it is generally said that during an economic downturn insurers see an increase of fraudulent claims on their books
2936475 with the economy going the way it is people might claim for smaller losses when otherwise they might not have bothered
2936476 i was delighted with his first game in english football
2936477 hes got a goal threat but that was something we were aware of when we signed him
2936478 i didnt realise it was that long but weve done a fair bit of shooting this week and we did it position specific so midfield players were shooting from outside the box while forwards were shooting from inside the area

2936536 well remember this summer not as the summer from hell but of disappointment
2936537 people are feeling that it doesnt matter if they save money on air conditioning or that theyre healthier because theres no smog its just too wet and stormy
2936538 every day we get rain were just going to continue to break the previous record until aug 31
2936539 whats remarkable about this is the contrast with last year which was one of our worst droughts
2936540 the big smoke has been replaced by the big wet
2936541 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2936542 were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2936543 i live far away and came here because i wanted to share prayers and worship god with president bush

2936546 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2936547 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2936548 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2936549 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2936550 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2936551 my father wakes up and he goes what are you making so much noise for
2936552 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2936553 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in
2936554 thorough review to determine if any of the regulations were not followed
2936555 the absolutely insane danger of having that propane facility so close to a community i feel like an idiot we were totally unprepared
2936556 that a house was on fire then i realized the floor my bed the bathroom were covered in broken glass
2936557 the whole thing blew up like turning a stove burner on full and putting your face next to it there was a fireball that had to be 20 storeys high and 20 storeys wide
2936558 mid industrial for many many years since the days of north york even so we need a lot of review to find out exactly when sunrise propane became the owner there was a zoning application done in 2006
2936559 it would appear that they were adhering to at least the rules that they have to have at least what are called isolatables set ups for determining what direction something could ignite in if the worst should happen
2936560 and they do appear to have adhered to that because the explosions went north and south and not east and west toward residents
2936561 but as to why the facility was there whether the private owner was breaking the rules we dont have the answers to those questions yet
2936562 you dont want to put an unnecessary number of officers at risk but deputy chief kim derry is confident that there are enough police in the area
2936563 a traumatic injury it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2936564 its hard its hard im sure that all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2936565 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion could have been much more serious
2936566 assessing the impact of the explosion on our facility so far we have noted broken windows shaken debris buckled doors computer and other electrical related interruptions there may be some areas where damage from the explosion makes it unsafe to work
2936567 then i realized it wasnt fog the next thing i know bam i was flying across the room
2936568 i looked back towards our house it looked like the sun was rising
2936569 if id had my head outside if the screen hadnt been there id be dead
2936570 the woman felt sorry for us and gave us half off

2936573 i cant believe it i cant believe they got the dog
2936574 we should not underestimate the gravity of the case against the president when he put his hand on the bible and recited his oath of office he swore to faithfully uphold the laws of the united states not some laws all laws
2936575 being a poor example isnt grounds for impeachment undermining the rule of law is
2936576 when americans come to washington they see the words equal justice under law carved in the facade of the supreme court building those words mean that the weak and the poor have an equal right to justice as do the rich and the powerful
2936577 this has been a very trying time in a democracy there are few more serious acts than to consider the possible impeachment of a president i can tell you in true conscience it has caused me many sleepless nights
2936578 mr chairman this is a somber occasion i am here because it is my constitutional duty as it is the constitutional duty of every member of this committee to follow the truth wherever it may lead

2936588 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships
2936589 organ donation even if it involves valuable consideration may make life better for both parties who find no way out of problems of health or poverty if the state and the altruists cannot help the poor in overcoming their problems it ought not to raise more barriers for them

2936596 there is no statistical basis for the p125 wage hike petition the p125 demand has become a political battlecry of workers
2936597 back then the average family living wage for a family of six was p379 51 a day on a national average based on data from the national wages and productivity commission nwpc in contrast the daily minimum wage stood at a national average of p193 67 a p125 wage increase at that time would have brought the national average minimum wage to p318 67 or p60 84 short of the national average family living wage that year

2936633 it is by chance that we met by choice that we became friends
2936634 i just dont understand why the police took my sons life
2936635 he was shy he wasnt the type of guy who would antagonize a police officer
2936636 he didnt like clubbing or drinking beer he was a quiet guy he liked to stay in
2936637 i cant tell you what they were doing we dont even know how many teenagers there were

2936647 in the years weve been conducting this study weve never seen such dramatic year over year shifts in the rankings of the six domestic and foreign domestic automakers
2936648 this could signal a new chapter in oem supplier relations going forward
2936649 chryslers showing is especially unfortunate fifteen years ago chrysler was clearly ranked no 1 by suppliers but today has fallen rather dramatically to last place since being taken over by cerberus
2936650 last year gms largest suppliers indicated that they were sharing new technology without the assurance of a purchase order and investing in new technology in anticipation of future business to the greatest extent in many years because of improved relations with gm this year chryslers suppliers tell us that they have significantly pulled back in both of these areas because of worsening relations with chrysler
2936651 the two year drop of worsening supplier relations at chrysler has resulted in suppliers treating chrysler as chrysler has been treating them in todays poor economy and intense competitive environment such behavior toward suppliers by chrysler just doesnt make sense
2936652 now is not the time to take an adversarial approach to working with suppliers every automaker should be striving to work in a more trusting way with its suppliers so that it can take full advantage of the benefits they offer and strengthen its marketplace advantage suppliers simply respond in kind and chrysler is paying the price
2936653 supplier working relations within each oem vary among the various purchasing areas indicating that it is the oem personnel who have the day to day responsibility of working with suppliers who are the primary determinants of the companys supplier relations this indicates the importance of having performance metrics in place to drive the desired behavior of these individuals
2936654 the challenges of rampant increases in material costs poor economic conditions and increasingly intensive competition require that each oem works more closely than ever with its suppliers to maximize its chances for success
2936655 the turmoil in supplier relations among all of the oem implies that purchasing vps who know better have forgotten this fundamental premise of supplier relations
2936656 by putting in place performance metrics that drive the behaviors of the personnel who interface with suppliers the needed supplier relations will occur with the right performance metrics every oem can improve its supplier relations to the benefit of both itself and its suppliers
2936657 op dit moment is het denk ik redelijk om te zeggen dat morgen zal komen en gaan zonder dat er iets gebeurt
2936658 usually the candidate manages the campaign here the campaign has a person whose responsibility is to make sure that the candidate agrees to the campaigns message so this is the guy who wants to run the country

2936738 this facility was allowed under zoning bylaws that have been there for well over a decade i suspect for a very long time
2936739 there are details yet to wait to come in like how the site was approved we dont know if they were over the capacity they were zoned for
2936740 it will of course have to be investigated but that will have to come after were sure everyone is safe and theres no more danger in the area
2936741 ive been expecting something to happen there for years and years
2936742 thats the stupidest stuff to put that in a residential area
2936743 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2936744 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2936745 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2936746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2936747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2936748 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2936749 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2936750 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2936751 we are delighted and honoured that the ioc has chosen south africa for its 123rd gathering the city and the nation look forward to welcoming olympic committee delegates in 2011
2936752 south africa is now firmly entrenched as a destination with big event capability and infrastructure
2936753 the iocs decision to bring its congress here is affirmation of our capacity to host the most high profile and significant of the worlds conferences meetings and exhibitions this is a reputation that south africa has been working hard to build since it successfully hosted the world summit on sustainable development in 2002 and that won it the right to host the 2010 fifa world cup

2936757 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
2936758 edwards hired her as a front to continue their relationship
2936759 he said he said he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
2936760 admitted the national enquirer was correct when it reported he had visited hunter at the beverly hills hilton last month
2936761 keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2936762 saiid it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
2936763 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2936764 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2936765 obviously the convention has not been our driving force behind the story
2936766 perel pauses if the convention wasnt part of the timetable before it is now
2936767 praying that tomorrow will not be as cold as today because she doesnt have the coat to keep her warm
2936768 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
2936769 disappearing from the national stage unless he finds a way to squelch this story fast
2936770 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances
2936771 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer which slipped out before pierces ban kf and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
2936772 its a story that were taking a long view of
2936773 weve got a big exclusive coming out this week and we are on the trail of some stuff thats even hotter
2936774 not about the photos but about the rest of the story and the story is just going to get bigger from here
2936775 everythings done incrementally so im not going to tell you exactly what our process is perhaps my time frame is different than your time frame im not worried about the rest of the media im worried about us
2936776 if you had this rumor about bill clinton it probably wouldnt cause a ripple
2936777 but given john edwards and his public relationship with his wife something close to a model of the perfect family and their perfect relationship it would hurt that much more
2936778 opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action do you support that
2936779 yes i do i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals but ive always opposed quotas
2936780 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
2936781 within minutes of posting yesterday i recognized that it was indeed heavyhanded and had it unpublished
2936782 i may be identifying with elizabeth a little too closely as an oversharing cancer survivor and all
2936783 we dont want to get it at all not even just a mention of the allegation not even second
2936784 edwards isnt considered a likely vice presidential candidate by the press
2936785 its so easy to jump to conclusions and i admit this looks bad
2936786 if the account of him being caught in a hotel rendezvous with rielle hunter was false edwards wouldnt be changing the subject hed be suing
2936787 which story gets a bigger audience a story the blogs run with but the mainstream news ignores or a story the news runs with but the blogs ignore im thinking the news comes out ahead but just barely and at this rate not for much longer
2936788 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
2936789 will mccain respect obamas views once obama has studied the issue
2936790 supposed to be about supplying some needed capital to the subprime market
2936791 the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
2936792 im a big success and im telling you losers what to do
2936793 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
2936794 i urge you all to stay in school ive seen what happened to friends of mine i know what would have happened to me the odds against people who drop out of high school are not good
2936795 so turn off the tv set put the video game away
2936796 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
2936797 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our borders and so we failed in our efforts we must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states of america

2936800 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
2936801 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
2936802 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
2936803 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse
2936804 a mid size sports sedan for 60 000 a competitor to the bmw 5 series and jaguar xf
2936805 it would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
2936806 but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary
2936807 in increasingly strident terms his commitment to legalizing all the illegal aliens
2936808 i dont want you to take out of context what i said during the campaign
2936809 s peaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane obama said the actress doesnt have his personal email address
2936810 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
2936811 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
2936812 i feel like im supporting someone and having a personal dialogue with them and its amazing
2936813 failed to generate the kind of republican primary turnout typically enjoyed by house incumbents
2936814 keep a more progressive social security program from being seen as welfare
2936815 does a work test keep the eitc from being seen as welfare
2936816 the eitc has fared much better than welfare programs without a work test
2936817 then he said i bet some of you dont know this did you know spanish was spoken in arizona before english
2936818 i didnt call him i called my friend who happened to be with him at the time
2936819 black fathers who arent in the home are much more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than absentee white fathers or for that matter fathers of any other ethnic group
2936820 obama is the greatest nothing this great has happened to us in a long time the only thing we have to worry about is what well have to wear to the inauguration
2936821 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
2936822 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
2936823 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
2936824 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
2936825 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
2936826 it will only produce an immediate 17 increase in immigration
2936827 editorial staff is about two thirds its size in the late 1990s

2936830 lets see how about never that fits my schedule t
2936831 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
2936832 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle
2936833 obama aides also said clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists including funds from representatives of countrywide which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown
2936834 im glad to report that starbucks is indeed considering some sort of elite status
2936835 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
2936836 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
2936837 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
2936838 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
2936839 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
2936840 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
2936841 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
2936842 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
2936843 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
2936844 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
2936845 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
2936846 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
2936847 you dont run for president unless you want to work in the administration
2936848 clearly what is going on in brazil is pushing that envelope
2936849 i would never say never but it would be a hard sell
2936850 dont you think theres a major difference between a pol who admits he sired a love child and one who denies it
2936851 voted for george bush i know it for dead certitude
2936852 i know neither actor but i assume they were acting
2936853 unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform i dont think you can take it piecemeal
2936854 because as soon you and i start to talk about the highly skilled workers our agricultural interest people are going to say look we need ag workers too
2936855 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states
2936856 and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
2936857 a flake and a poser and an attention seeking diva

2936860 there is an enthusiasm for getting rid of labour not yet matched by an equal enthusiasm for a tory government we acknowledge that
2936861 the main conclusion from the poll is that we have got a little bit closer to the general election and still there is no major change in labours position the time is ticking by and labour is still facing disaster
2936862 go for it gordon spend to succeed its time to shift the balances back from empowering the market to management intervention and regulation

2936867 what i dont know is why people pirate my games
2936868 i might be able to get a general idea as to why people pirate stuff in general from reading warez forums and every other story on digg but im not interested in the general case i want to improve my business and ensure i stay afloat and to do that it would be mad to sit in the corner and ignore the opinions of that section of the public who pirate my games
2936869 i wont publicise who e mailed me or even store the addresses share them tell anyone them or make any use of them whatsoever ill just read them nothing else it will be entirely off the record and effectively anonymous i wont hand any email addresses to the riaa mpaa bsa or anyone at all under any circumstances ever
2936870 i occasionally post about piracy on my blog and i get a lot of comments from people who defend piracy or think i am too strongly against it or that i blow it out of proportion
2936871 the last few times i read these comments i got to thinking about the other side of the fence and wondering if there was something i just didnt get pirates never talk to the developers so i thought id see if there was something i could learn from it if i asked them for their honest views
2936872 i think its crazy for people to resent such a small price for a game i dont feel like the world has ended though we all routinely spend more than 10 or 15 on things that dont last as long as a decent pc game
2936873 a 15 t shirt can be a spur of the moment buy but a game for the same cost needs to be a work of genius i dont get why that is
2936874 most of them have been generic piracy points which is interesting although not the original request
2936875 i have got a few sarcastic ones but a lot of very long well thought out explanations mainly from people who dont pirate games now but used to in the past
2936876 pirates deliver a more convenient product at a better price
2936877 the ones that bug me are the people who are just trying to save money but could afford it or the ones with some intellectual justification for believing its their human rights to get free stuff
2936878 the thing is i personally prefer single player games so thats the style of game i design i do think a lot about the best way to set up my game demos the website and what after sales support content and patches to provide in order to reduce the extent of piracy for my games
2936879 i honestly think i might learn something ip owners characterize all pirates as freeloading scum
2936880 pirates characterize all ip owners as fat cat billionaires in gold plated ferraris its about time we both listened to each other more
2936881 dont be afraid to talk about piracy a lot of big name developers have blamed piracy for disappointing sales and there is a perception that the minute you mention it everyone will kick you in the face because its happened a lot recently
2936882 what could i have done to prevent this is it my fault that hes gay

2936905 this task force was quite controversial and many in the department of justice felt that it was a waste of resources
2936906 because of the pressure they seem to have chosen the worst cases they can find to prosecute
2936907 a lot of this is about sending a message dont make this stuff
2936908 i think watching something like that would make me physically ill nauseous

2936914 i got to duke and discovered that yes i am going to play for coach k
2936915 we get to duke and we realize you are our coach not just the coach of our team but you are also our coach because you believe that we give you something no one else can and we know that you give us something that no one ever could

2936939 we clearly had some issues with organizations that dont respect the scouts right as a private organization to set its own membership standards and have withdrawn their support
2936940 but frankly thats their right too and we respect that
2936941 their hunger for food is employed solely as a metaphor for their sexual appetite
2936942 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2936943 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2936944 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2936945 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2936946 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2936947 to admit that there is one who lies beyond us who exists outside of all our categories who will not be dismissed with a name who will not appear before the bar of our reason nor submit to our curious inquiries this requires a great deal of humility more than most of us possess so we save face by thinking him down to our level or at least down to where we can manage him yet how he eludes us timeless spaceless single lonely yet sublimely three thou art grandly always only god in unity lone in grandeur lone in glory who shall tell thy wondrous story awful trinity
2936948 the divine attributes are what we know to be true of god he does not possess them as qualities they are how god is as he reveals himself to his creatures love for instance is not something god has and which may grow or diminish or cease to be his love is the way god is and when he loves he is simply being himself
2936949 the man who comes to a right belief about god is relieved of ten thousand temporal problems for he sees at once that these have to do with matters which at most cannot concern him for very long but even if the multiple burdens of time may be lifted from him the one mighty single burden of eternity begins to press down upon him with a weight more crushing than all the woes of the world piled one upon another
2936950 i know men and i tell you that jesus christ is not a man superficial minds see a resemblance between christ and the founders of empires and the gods of other religions that resemblance does not exist there is between christianity and whatever religions the distance of infinity everything about christ astonishes me his spirit overawes me and his will confounds me between him and whoever else in the world there is no possible tern of comparison he is truly a being by himself his ideas and his sentiments the truth which he announces his manner of convincing are not explained either by human organization or by the nature of things the nearer i approach the more carefully i examine everything is above me everything remains grand of a grandeur which overpowers his religion is a revelation from and intelligence which certainly is not that of man there is a profound originality which has created a series of words and of maxims before unknown jesus borrowed nothing from our science one can absolutely find nowhere but in him alone the imitation or the example of his life i search in vain in history to find the similar to jesus christ or anything which can approach the gospel neither history nor humanity nor the ages nor nature offer me anything with which i am able to compare it or to explain it here everything is extraordinary the more i consider the gospel the more i am assured that there is nothing there which is not beyond the march of events and above the human mind
2936951 questi variegati e bellissimi temi sono il prodotto della terra
2936952 nelle melodie della gente nero americana io trovo vi sia tutto quanto necessiti ad una grande e nobile scuola musicale
2936953 il jazz limportante contributo dei tempi moderni nei confronti della musica
2936954 il jazz una ricca e vitale fonte dispirazione per i compositori moderni ed io sono sorpreso che cos pochi americani siano influenzati da esso
2936955 6 ed in particolare arthur honegger e darius milhaud erano attratti dal jazz ragtime e dalle altre musiche nero americane
2936956 tra i neri noi possiamo trovare la sorgente stessa di questa musica il suo lato profondamente umano che pu essere sia assolutamente toccante sia affatto universalmente riconosciuto quale capolavoro musicale
2936957 nella sua forma originale esso jazz non ha alcun posto nelleducazione musicale e non lo merita esso dovr modificarsi molte volte prima di presentare le proprie credenziali per il walhalla della musica
2936958 esso probabilmente non andr oltre i suoi particolari limiti per dichiarare che la cultura musicale nel nostro paese in abietto declino il discernimento del significato di buona musica dalla cultura inteso come distinto dal puro jazz
2936959 io sentivo di aver fatto tutto quanto potevo utilizzando lidioma del jazz considerato il suo limitato ambito emozionale in alcun modo possibile confinare la musica americana ai due mood jazz e blues o ai numeri musicali ad effetto
2936960 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2936961 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2936962 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2936972 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

2936974 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
2936975 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

2936979 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
2936980 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
2936981 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
2936982 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
2936983 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
2936984 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
2936985 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
2936986 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
2936987 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2936988 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2936989 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2936990 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2936991 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2936992 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
2936993 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
2936994 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
2936995 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
2936996 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
2936997 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
2936998 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional

2937001 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano

2937004 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2937005 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2937006 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
2937007 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
2937008 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
2937009 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

2937019 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
2937020 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

2937029 for her to win that one first the thing is how she now takes that on i thought the 400 would be a bit beyond her
2937030 thats a great mark of somebody whos going to go places she really wants to improve improve improve
2937031 all it needed was a look at her mental attitude because some swimmers cave in under pressure when i saw her and heard her interview i knew she could do it
2937032 i think bill sweetenham took a lot of flak but he shook things up and lottery funding weve now had more funding into the sport for coaches facilities its taken that long to see the benefits

2937039 of course that would be wonderful if we could do that and it would be wonderful if the teams are also strong

2937042 i would like to urge the asian fans to cheer our teams and players so that they can compete with european or south american teams
2937043 un anno dopo avere preso il potere totale sopra la striscia di gaza hamas pi forte di allora
2937044 e importante per gli israeliani che hamas rimanga forte a gaza perch questo significa che nessuno li forzer a negoziare seriamente una piano di pace
2937045 il cessate il fuoco pu essere buono per la gente di gaza ma non per noi
2937046 chiunque che abbia commesso lomicidio deve anche essere punito con la morte

2937068 did you humbly and patiently accept this mystery of iniquity in your life how did you deal with it did you learn from it to be patient and humble did it teach you to trust not your own ability but my love did it enable you to understand better the mystery of iniquity in the lives of others did it give you the most typical characteristic of a truly religious person that he never judges or condemns the sin and imperfection of others

2937072 i am a big fan of this casino computer programmer volunteers paper it lays out the ground work for exceptional progress and investment in this sector personally im going to invest my own funds in project development
2937073 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by casino computer programmer volunteers firms would go a long way
2937074 stiteler riecke really put well when saying it aint over with casino computer programmer volunteers until its over
2937075 and im with them all the way until its time to move on
2937076 we find this paper about casino computer programmer volunteers from ralbovsky kostelnick to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
2937077 i never thought that casino computer programmer volunteers would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way

2937203 i felt great the first 50 its just been a really tough year for me
2937204 obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit i felt good going into the race tonight but obviously everybody swam their a game
2937205 hopefully it means the sport is still progressing and it hasnt become stagnant yet
2937206 i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
2937207 it was looking like sergios day and i just wanted to hang around and get some opportunities
2937208 i knew what i had to do i was playing catch up and had to take on the shots on the back nine that would mean the difference between winning or losing
2937209 you know the good thing about it is i feel good out there i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
2937210 those guys were having such a good battle every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play out there in a championship like this
2937211 coming down the last two holes i had a chance to win the golf tournament and thats all you can ask you dont get these opportunities very often and to be able to stick in there and to be able to hold my emotions under control is a good feeling

2937216 so on days like today where for no justifiable reason at all im filled with silly doubts where im questioning things that are obvious where im creating complexities out of the most simple situations i long to be able to voice my thoughts so i can get some distance from them and accept just how illogical they are and i know that they are as a glass half full optimist i always see the positive side of life

2937230 without fear in quiet confidence that god will do his will in the confusion
2937231 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2937232 she got lots of messages from a guy saying he was pete doherty and wanted her to come to england to visit him
2937233 those photos of pete that found their way into the papers werent true he was bullied into having those photos taken pete had put certain noses out of joint and that was their way of getting revenge hes such a sweet boy it was heart breaking to see him reduced to that cowering victim i felt very protective towards him but he was a popular lad in prison unfortunately most of the guys in there are pretty confident theyll see him again they all think hell be back inside before long
2937234 the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified
2937235 it was a superb performance he was a constant thorn to portsmouth and it is just a pity he did not get a goal
2937236 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him
2937237 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2937238 but it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2937239 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2937240 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2937241 we believe open discussions and dialogues on issues of religious conversions are imperative to find solutions
2937242 not allowed to hold open discussions in relation to our constitution and its laws then it makes a complete mockery of our legal system

2937246 the first time he hit me on the cup and then there was another blow after that in around the same place
2937247 with the crowd all around me it felt like i was getting smaller and smaller eventually i could feel myself coming around the bout and getting back into it
2937248 im glad the first fight is over and done with i know what to expect now
2937249 he was a bit nervous but everyone coming into this venue is bound to be you cant prepare yourself for boxing at the olympics for the first time
2937250 now hes got his first fight over with im sure bradley can go on and get better and better
2937251 like all of our boxers bradley has got better since the world championships and he is far stronger than ever before
2937252 im going to stick it out and give it my all against the cuban it will be a battle to the end but im in it to win a medal for great britain
2937253 at the moment he is with us and we have had no formal offer from anybody there is interest here and there but nothing concrete
2937254 ive found out with phone calls in the last few days that there seem to be a lot of right backs available
2937255 sometimes a deal comes around thats just too good to refuse he admitted
2937256 luke did well for us last season but at 29 that sort of financial offer we felt was the right decision for the club
2937257 luke also expressed a desire to take up that opportunity which we had to take into consideration it does leave us a little short in terms of experience in that position but weve got young players who can play there like rhys williams hes a welsh under 21 international
2937258 were looking to strengthen the squad theres no doubt about it but i must say that the condition were in and the way that they are playing im very very pleased
2937259 i was really pleased with the performance the way we stopped them from playing was very pleasing we won the ball back and played we know weve got players who can score goals weve got terrific pace and movement in attack i was really pleased with the football we played it was nice to see the players play with freedom and with a smile of their faces
2937260 thats what we wanted in the perfect world four home goals on the first day said wilson
2937261 the performance was brilliant from start to finish front to back every player was superb
2937262 when willie scored i nearly went home ive never seen anything like that he doesnt even do it in training
2937263 his game was spot on and the competition for places helped willie as well with plenty of players in there for the job they are all inspiring each other
2937264 but it was one game and no one gets carried away after it you never know for willie the goals may come in twos and threes now he has one
2937265 he is a terrific all round player and capped a very good performance the last time pools saw off the same opposition on the opening day was in 1996 when joe allon successfully put 20 on himself to score the first goal at 7 1 and boss keith houchen was sacked 16 games later
2937266 we got straight at them and we wanted a high pressure game from front to back said wilson
2937267 we got it and the s e c o n d g o a l came because we pressed them and chased
2937268 two goals within minutes was very settling but we deserved it
2937269 if there is a downside only a small one was the penalty decision which was a tough one to call
2937270 i dont think we can argue how we played we stifled them arran lee barrett had one save to make and he made it very well which says a lot about how well we played throughout
2937271 we set about our business from the off and the front lads gave us a platform
2937272 james was superb he played ok he played ok didnt he
2937273 potentially he has a great future and we know we have a terrific player on our books
2937274 it took a while to adjust to the conditions especially the wind and the heat but as the day went on we got used to it
2937275 i think we will be much stronger tomorrow and there are a few things we will need to tweak between now and then
2937276 overall we are happy with fifth and are feeling very confident going into tomorrow
2937277 you look at what impact alison williamson has had after winning her bronze in athens it has allowed me to improve my level of training because of the increased funding from uk sport
2937278 i think leading up to 2012 if we got another medal then the potential would be really exciting
2937279 especially leading up to 2012 it would be brilliant to be part of it and pushing the sport forward
2937280 we are placed winning at lords would be quite something
2937281 youre only ever two or three games away from turning things around
2937282 you could say the solution is mainly in the players hands but the manager also helps
2937283 thats what ill be doing with alan smith as ive done with damien duff or any other player who has a problem with confidence or who goes through a spell where theyre not playing much and cant get any continuity
2937284 i definitely think theres a lot more to come from alan
2937285 hes got a lot of desire if he didnt have any desire id say you were wasting your time but desire and hard work together u s u a l l y means you can turn it a r o u n d i v e k n o w n lots of players turn t h e m s e l v e s around and i know alan will
2937286 were monitoring the situation with michael but by about wednesday or thursday we should know
2937287 itll be michael himself deciding whether hes fit enough to come into a premier league game
2937288 its a decision thatll be made on the evidence of training and a practice match we may decide its not the right thing to do or we may decide yeah weve got to do it
2937289 i dont think fabricios fitness levels are quite the same as ours but he trained on saturday morning and he looks okay
2937290 his situation is a little bit like michael well gauge his fitness over the next few days and itll show just how fit he is if we think its too early we wont play him but he could be on the bench at old trafford or he might even play from the start

2937292 i am not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about
2937293 there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it it has been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2937294 at this time of year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2937295 anything we have said in regard of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it he is staying absolutely he is staying
2937296 particularly our own supporters who travelled and spent good money to see the game but ive never seen rain like it in my life before
2937297 my boyfriend and i were walking along singapore river this evening and while trying to take a nice picture of alkaff bridge we noticed someone swimming or what seemed like a nice bath in the river
2937298 there was another guy holding a towel waiting for the swimming guy to finish
2937299 the guy caucasian came out of the water and started to parade naked while the other guy tried frantically to cover his private parts with the towel and he started to wear his jeans in the open without his underwear apparently
2937300 let us not tear it but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be
2937301 they divided my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots
2937302 the rendering it is finished conveys only half the meaning for the verb fundamentally denotes to carry out the will of somebody whether of oneself or another and so to fulfill obligations or carry out religious acts it is accomplished renders that aspect of the word
2937303 jesus died with the cry of the victor on his lips this is not the moan of the defeated nor the sigh of a patient resignation it is the triumphant recognition that he was now fully accomplished the work that he came to do
2937304 john does not say that jesus died and then his head slumped over but rather that he bowed his head an attitude of submission and then gave over paraedoken his spirit
2937305 nailed upon the cross he exhibited many notable signs by which is death was distinguished from all others by his own free will he dismissed from him his spirit with a word anticipating the executioners work
2937306 there does seem to be an element of voluntariness that is not found in the case of others
2937307 he did not wait for death which was lagging behind as it were in fear to come to him instead he pursed it from behind and drove it on and trampled it under his feet as it was fleeting he burst the eternal gates of deaths dark realms and made a road of return back again to life for the dead bound there with the bonds of death
2937308 the spirit of the mediator has shown how it was not any punishment for sin that brought about the death of his flesh because he did not abandon it unwillingly
2937309 and as jesus on the cross having lived a sinless life having paid the penalty for your sins and mine jesus uttered his last words before dying
2937310 he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness by his wounds you have been healed for you were straying like sheep but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls

2937322 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player he is almost 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2937323 i would be delighted for rio if he was made england captain
2937324 obviously i hope its rio as he is a teammate of mine and it would be great for the club
2937325 he is certainly the best defender in the club at the moment and it would be well deserved
2937326 i am sure we will find out in due course
2937327 john mccain believes in a strong national defense a smaller more accountable government steady economic growth and opportunity the dignity of life and traditional values

2937337 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet

2937344 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
2937345 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2937346 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2937347 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2937348 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2937349 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2937350 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2937351 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
2937352 i think this is a project that will run more than just months
2937353 its hard to believe that within three to six months we would add messaging to firefox this is a rough estimate but i think its a one to two year thing
2937354 in coming months we expect to see signs of a widespread slowdown in the electronics sector which would directly impact semiconductor sales

2937360 we know we have to score to win but we also have to pitch to win
2937361 and pitching is the bigger priority if you cant pitch youve got no shot we are not going to score eight runs every game weve got a big series ahead of us we can go in there and stay in the race or we can go up there and be out of it
2937362 wed like to score eight runs every night but we arent going to do it we have a meaningful series in map coming up thats huge the pitchers have got to step up and weve got to play good baseball
2937363 we love the offense we have here we need to do a better job its our job to pitch as well as we can the rest will take care of itself

2937372 for many many years since the days of north york
2937373 i understand this is a very upsetting thing for people to be living through
2937374 but as to why the facility was there whether the private owner was breaking the rules we dont have the answers to those questions yet
2937375 there are so many elderly people who live in the area and we have always wondered why this propane place was there
2937376 and we want to ensure that we do everything we can to protect people and their property

2937418 in my view a judge in family cases has a much broader discretion to conduct the case as is most appropriate for the issues involved and the evidence available there is a spectrum of procedure for family cases from the ex parte application on minimal evidence to the full and detailed investigations on oral evidence which may be prolonged where on that spectrum a judge decides a particular application should be placed is a matter for his discretion applications for residence orders or for committal to the care of a local authority or revocation of a care order are likely to be decided on full oral evidence but not invariably such is not the case on contact applications which may be and are heard sometimes with and sometimes without oral evidence or with a limited amount of oral evidence
2937419 at 6a d butler sloss lj indicated that in deciding whether to conduct a full investigation with oral evidence a judge should consider 1 a whether there was already sufficient evidence to make the decision 2 b whether the proposed further evidence was likely to affect the outcome of the proceedings 3 c whether the opportunity to cross examine witnesses was likely to affect the outcome 4 d whether a full investigation including any consequential delay would be injurious to the welfare of the child 5 e whether the applicant for a full trial had real prospects of success and 6 f whether the justice of the case required a full investigation

2937503 since access to information about educational alternatives is now much more open thanks mainly to the internet many parents who contact schoolhouse have already done their own research into home education but often report finding conflicting information regarding the legal situation
2937504 it is frustrating to hear from families who have run into difficulties with their local authority having relied in good faith on erroneous information and removed their children from school without following the proper procedures
2937505 as an exclusively scottish organisation we can reassure parents that the schoolhouse website 2 contains accurate and up to date information about home education in scotland with a link to the current statutory guidance issued by the scottish government 3
2937506 we expect an increase in enquiries at this time of year from parents whose children find going to school difficult for one reason or another as well as from those who just want to make contact with other families as they begin their planned home education journey

2937599 i am willing to do whatever kind of job they offer me
2937600 i did not think this would be this hard before it was easier to find a job
2937601 the problem is that the manufacturing industry above all the textile industry is disappearing now jobs available are more technical and hispanics need training to find those jobs
2937602 we know that 2006 was the peak in hispanic homeownership with 49 percent since then more and more hispanics are losing their homes
2937603 what does that say to you about the strength of the oppositions confidence in themselves if they think people would rather be watching the olympic games than watching what the alternative premier of the state has got to say

2937605 ill guarantee that if we have the debate this week therell be a lot of people watching
2937606 not everybody not everybody would rather watch sport on tv than watch the debate
2937607 and for a lot of people who arent interested in watching the debate it wouldnt matter what was on they wont watch it

2937612 the palestinian leadership has worked to establish an independent palestinian state within the 1967 pre six day war borders but if israel continues to resist making this a reality then the palestinians demand for the sake of the palestinian people will be a solution of one state for both nationalities

2937643 i am fortunate enough to have played in four nba finals and numerous big games but it was just different you felt like there was so much more support because its the usa and obviously how proud the fans are here of their country
2937644 you just understood that there was something that was bigger than the game it wasnt just a finals game or a seventh game it was bigger than that
2937645 it was amazing i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd
2937646 the last time i had five dunks in a game i was 17 thats all because of the energy of this crowd

2937651 convicted killer bailey junior kurariki has escaped a recall to prison the parole board said today it had declined to make a final recall order for the young man
2937652 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2937653 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2937654 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2937655 i saw the explosion in the morning nobody was there to protect me and now were not getting protected
2937656 its messed up here and i gotta work in the morning
2937657 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2937658 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2937659 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2937660 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2937661 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2937662 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2937663 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2937664 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2937665 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2937666 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2937667 i cant give you a definitive statement on that right now
2937668 but there is a very good chance that i may be swiss
2937669 the place looks rather bare i think it could do with some grass
2937670 that looks wonderful but it seems rather a waste without some cows to eat it
2937671 do you know ive been creating all week and thats the first time anyones given me anything most gratifying will there be anything else
2937672 im delighted to have recruited this dynamic team im confident they will prove a real asset and help us maintain our position as one of the countrys most successful law firms
2937673 my wife and i have travelled to reside in england
2937674 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2937675 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2937676 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2937677 we need to do something about it its getting worse
2937678 i really believe this is the tip of the iceberg
2937679 there is no interest in schools or police pretending these things are not happening in the past i have relied on anecdotal evidence but it is good to have some hard evidence of this problem
2937680 these figures show weapon carrying by young people is relatively low in our region and equates to less than one weapon being found in each school every 20 years
2937681 but weapons should not be carried at any time and we are working with schools to make young people aware of this
2937682 the police obviously have these figures they should not really rely on the m e n having to go through foi to release them
2937683 everybody is served well by this information coming out the m e n have done a good service to the community hopefully now head teachers principals and education authorities will take appropriate action
2937684 carrying weapons is becoming acceptable i really believe we need to do something about it
2937685 we believe our water and waste water services will continue to represent outstanding value for money this is a draft plan we are keen to get a wide range of views before details are finalised
2937686 unscrupulous critics have at various times suggested that congestion charging will be extended to the district towns and that a typical payment would be 8
2937687 there are obviously no plans to extend charging to the districts towns
2937688 i cant wait to box at the m e n arena after seeing how many people came out to see me my fans are amazing and id like to thank them for taking the time to come out and support me i usually train in private but its nice to show the public some of what i do
2937689 theres been an improvement already and ill be getting better in the coming months
2937690 weve had some really good figures and good arrests but this is primarily about reassuring the public and disrupting illegal activity
2937691 its all well and good me saying no that im not going after playing for a long time but itd be unfair to put a daniel flynn or a tim southee in that position
2937692 i want to make sure its a collective decision and not put in front of young guys because the young guys probably dont have the same options as the more experienced players
2937693 we were in the gymnasium and i asked him if i could take a picture with him just so i could have it for memories
2937694 he asked me how is your leg doing im going to check you out and im going to keep you in my heart and hope everything comes along well i texted my mom right when it happened like kobes praying for my leg
2937695 she was shocked as well it was just amazing it really meant something to me because hes a huge superstar
2937696 it took about four weeks for it to get fully recovered but ive been getting rehab on it and doing some light training
2937697 it feels good i dont feel any aches any twinges or anything like that ive been staying hydrated and taking care of my body very well so im really confident its going to hold up

2937816 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2937817 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2937818 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2937819 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously

2937852 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2937853 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2937854 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2937857 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2937858 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2937859 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2937860 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2937861 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2937964 george clooney who won the poll by a landslide 33 is an icon for guys to be confident as they age and leave the hair dye for the girls clooney has certainly aged well and got even more gorgeous as he greyed
2937965 david duchoveny clearly dyed his hair for the new x files movie making him in my opinion look daft and vain instead of smouldering and sexy
2937966 and we are delighted our readers share the opinions of sugahfix staff that our own home grown grey god frank mitchell can give the hollywood a listers a run for their money coming in third place in the poll and beating sex symbols sting sean connery and robert redford
2937967 to come in third place behind them its a race well won
2937968 if it was an olympic bronze medal i was getting for this id definitely be very pleased
2937969 i never thought id be in the top three grey haired people in the utv newsroom let alone a poll like this
2937970 i always thought that honour would go to paul clarke fearghal mckinney and pamela ballantine
2937971 its nice to be considered in such a poll at the age of 43
2937972 look at eamonn holmes these days hes going grey and i think he really suits it
2937973 we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage war
2937974 there should be no hatred between athletes and people in general well leave this to the politicians to figure out
2937975 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2937976 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will affect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
2937977 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time we dont get mixed up in political things sport is beyond politics
2937978 we have our own point of view about what is going on but we think this is a matter for the un not the beijing olympics
2937979 if we need to we are ready to go back to georgia like soldiers but after the president has asked us to stay here we have to respect this
2937980 all of us here journalists officials competitors we are very nervous i dont know why the russians hate us nobody expected what has happened it has exploded for us the olympic games are second now
2937981 the ioc believes this is the right decision especially for the athletes as it is a once in a lifetime experience for them

2937988 emma and sharon raced hard and kept it together on the flat and nicole finished it off the whole team got it spot on
2937989 our race plan went back more than 12 months and sharon emma and i all worked as a team emmas attacking enabled me to ride defensively
2937990 it allowed me to save myself which put me in a good position and put the other teams on the back foot as a team we rode a fantastic race i couldnt wait to give emma and sharon a big hug because they shared in this gold medal too
2937991 its a team race and if you work together youre much more likely to get a good result than if you dont its really satisfying to help someone win a medal because you know youve helped

2938042 the theme of this years international day of the worlds indigenous people is the protection and promotion of the worlds endangered languages which is especially relevant to australia whose aboriginal and torres strait islander languages are under threat of extinction
2938043 when language is lost knowledge and wisdom are lost and so too is identity it is through language that we interpret our belief systems our religion spirituality knowledge of country and so much more
2938044 indigenous languages can only be preserved through policies that commit governments to language maintenance and language revitalisation programs at all levels of australias educational institutions
2938045 this means employing indigenous language speakers in schools supporting bilingual programs where they exist creating benchmark testing options for indigenous literacies funding the development of indigenous language texts school books and picture dictionaries and any other action that supports and strengthens indigenous language literacy across australia
2938046 unfortunately the preservation of indigenous languages is considered a low priority when governments and others look to indigenous disadvantage but governments make a mistake if they ignore language and consider it a separate problem from health for example while indigenous people may be struggling with high levels of economic distress poor health and poor education outcomes it is our culture transmitted through our languages that defines us and gives us dignity and a sense of purpose
2938047 it will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times
2938048 instead of the usual one size fits all school districts should develop options for students including a curriculum that connects what they are learning in the classroom with real life experiences and with work
2938049 we do not intend to attack anyone but we consider it necessary for all our partners in the world community to clearly understand that to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of russia and its allies military forces will be used including preventively including with the use of nuclear weapons
2938050 if we think you are planning to attack someone we do not want you to we will nuke you before you get the chance
2938051 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2938052 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2938053 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2938054 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2938055 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2938056 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2938057 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2938058 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2938059 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2938060 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2938061 i guess theyve had trouble with the house ever since
2938062 it just busted through wednesday the water almost came up to the seventh step we just lost everything down there

2938064 im so proud to be able to be part of olympic history for indonesia this is the first medal for indonesia at the beijing olympics
2938065 i talked with eko about what happened in the second attempt he said he didnt feel powerful enough to make the attempt
2938066 i didnt want to force him to lift more than 158 kilograms in the clean and jerks third attempt i believe it would have been very risky
2938067 however i will compete in a higher class and definitely hope to earn a silver or a gold
2938068 i apologize to the people of indonesia for failing to win another medal
2938069 i tried my best of course i am very disappointed
2938070 i only prepared for the olympics after finishing the national games pon last month

2938085 ive listened to foreign exchange students worry about getting into college in their countries

2938087 one of the assignments was to write a paper i wrote the paper and he called me up shortly after that and asked me why i wasnt an english major he saw something in me that i didnt

2938093 its amazing ever since the beijing olympics have begun i have been watching the news and taking all the updates hoping to see india in the forefront in some sport monday began on a very good note with bindra winning the countrys first individual gold
2938094 its a proud moment for all of us we indians tend to underestimate ourselves i remember reading in a major news daily just the day before the olympics began that india will get a medal if lucky abhinav couldnt have done us more proud
2938095 this hopefully should just be the beginning i am hoping for another gold from rathore
2938096 i wont tell you the truth about your stupidities and dont get my case about mine

2938100 ben shared with me at the beginning of the year that one of his top goals was to earn a spot on the ryder cup team
2938101 im very excited for him he just keeps crossing thresholds doesnt he
2938102 ben has played on the world amateur team in 2000 representing his country and this is the next logical step for him in his career
2938103 what a great reward for what was really a great week
2938104 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2938105 you have to get focused and give it a go
2938106 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2938107 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2938108 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch

2938110 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2938111 i think they knew that history was being made tonight
2938112 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2938113 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2938114 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2938115 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt

2938129 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich

2938132 therefore while the settlement offer is well above the citys original appraisal the figure is not outside the potential exposure of the city when considering the value set by the court appointed commissioners and the citys exposure for costs and attorneys fees if a jury awards a value of at least 880 000 the property owners had filed to have their property platted and they allege their potential profit was between 3 4 million if this property completely developed

2938135 the next logical step was to allow people to access a similar message on their mobile phones we decided to move away from what is already on the market for example another tamagotchi influenced experience and develop a series of games based on classic arcade games
2938136 the aim of the game is to educate the user on the animal welfare act 2006 which places a duty of care on pet owners to ensure they look after their pet
2938137 the main aim is to convey in an entertaining way an animals prime welfare needs which includes the need for food and water shelter exercise and companionship and veterinary care when necessary
2938138 mobidog is interactive playful and educational with a competitive slant we hope it will help get the message about looking after pets properly across to a young audience

2938154 weve got the distance guys throwing off of the hill so guys that throw 600 feet on level ground are probably pushing 900 1 000 feet
2938155 the pros are doing the side games everybody is doing them
2938156 i do the mini golf putting distance skill shot challenge i do mixed doubles when i can and also singles so its a busy week for me but im just here to have fun
2938157 im looking for a fun time to play well and soak it in
2938158 just looking to have a lot of fun to see the competition from guys my age and to see how good they are
2938159 because people around where im at think im pretty good so they wanted to see me out here
2938160 throwing strikes with all of your pitches is definitely a key to winning not only to end the season with a complete game but coming off a couple of bad starts it feels good to go the distance and get a win
2938161 i talked to the team a few days ago and obviously were out of the race but i told them to just find something to play for and enjoy the experience
2938162 i can out shoot out ride and out fight anyone in this family and so i am going pa and thats all there is to it
2938163 my corn i take seriously because its mine and my potatoes and tomatoes and my fence i take note of because theyre mine but this war is not mine and i dont take note of it
2938164 honestly i didnt think we would lose it like this
2938165 i thought we had a pretty good team makeup and i still do but we just didnt get it done this time
2938166 well be back next year and we might even be a stronger team by then
2938167 like ive said before we kind of threw this team together at the last minute were a veteran team with high expectations but we were fortunate to get this far
2938168 obviously we didnt get the win and were not happy about that but overall i think this was a really fun season

2938171 the downtown partnership has been trying to help restaurants get outdoor seating for a cafe type atmosphere
2938172 i think the restaurants downtown are doing well the bistro seems to be established and doing well were slowly starting to see more people come downtown to enjoy what we have to offer
2938173 weve had that perception in the past and its a perception were concerned about
2938174 the only thing we can continue to do is encourage businesses to expand and succeed and not over regulate them
2938175 im not usually doing this in a gown and heels
2938176 i like the animals the atmosphere and i enjoy seeing the same people and old friends every year
2938177 i think this is a pretty classic country type fair and its about old fashioned type of fun
2938178 nothing too fancy or big but just a nice event to come to and eat some good food ride a few rides and see the 4 h kids compete
2938179 my father said well try this organic stuff i have four brothers and sisters and we all worked out in the field picking green beans and stuff like that and he didnt want his kids exposed to all the different sprays this year we have probably 65 acres of garden vegetables
2938180 most of our stuff goes to the whole foods grocery store chains in ann arbor west bloomfield troy rochester hills then we also sell to the peoples food co op in kalamazoo and the east lansing food co op
2938181 we dont go to the battle creek farmers market anymore we go to the royal oak farmers market in royal oak and the meridian farmers market in okemos
2938182 it seems to be well people that care about what they are eating and not so focused on price but more focused on quality or health issues
2938183 i dont think so i think theres a demand still for the organic stuff and our farm market prices and even our wholesale prices arent that much out of line from conventional stuff but usually at a farm market we are one of the more expensive if not the most expensive vendor at the farm market but we also try to maintain very high quality and customer service to all of our customers they know what we have is really organic were certified by ocia the organic crop improvement association
2938184 we have to document all of the seeds we buy all of the products inputs anything we buy for the farm has to be documented and has to meet organic standards all of our seeds are either organic or untreated seeds any manure we use has to be organic or acceptable for organic practices you know no hormones or antibiotics can be in it
2938185 not necessarily i mean i do eat all of the stuff that i grow and i do buy some organic stuff but me personally i dont buy all organic
2938186 well where we live its not really that available and thats part of the problem i do shop at regular grocery stores i do eat a lot of organic stuff but im not dedicated 100 percent organic
2938187 i do like to work with my family keep the family farm in business and the way we grow with organic stuff im in a little bit more control over all my products and sales when i was a little kid i liked driving tractors and i still like driving tractors i know if i work harder and do a good job that i can make more money that doesnt always happen you can work hard at an auto factory everybody gets paid the same

2938196 essentially what that report says is theres no evidence to establish the child was born alive
2938197 first more then 70 percent are involved in criminal activities they even steal manhole covers extremely dangerous for traffic secondly about 72 percent of the garbage collectors carry infectious diseases such as dysentery hepatitis and typhoid so they pose a health risk to others also their vehicles are too polluting and they have too many kids despite chinas strict family planning policy
2938198 it is not true its a lie they want to clear this place because maybe its a bit messy but we are healthy enough spreading rumours that we are ill its annoying if we were ill would we be able to rent this house wouldnt the government have made us leave sooner
2938199 it wont be an origin story per se but the origin will be covered i think youll see the lunch lady as well as cassie and vlad but we wanted to do something very different because this is the first chance to see a slasher movie where there is more then one slasher because it follows a hunter youre going with her and her accomplice as they go from one to another and building out the mythology of how this world works with its undead slashers cassie is a wonderful character the one that tim seeley created and this is a character based movie your going to get to know the people who are surviving or dying ive been pulling lines moments and scenes from the comics leading up to the numbered run that fans will notice

2938231 its a tough opening few games for us huddersfield and leicester twice
2938232 weve then got scunthorpe who will be a strong team just coming down from the championship and hartlepool away wont be easy
2938233 its up to the lads to rise to the challenge now though week in week out
2938234 we did that last year against hereford mk dons and peterborough but each game this season is going to be tough
2938235 once the players adjust to the challenges every week though we should adapt and get used to the level of demands
2938236 huddersfield have spent a lot of money as have a lot of teams who are chasing the big money on offer in the championship
2938237 theyve got a very experienced manager in stan ternent and theyre going to have a real push this season
2938238 you would imagine leicester will be one of the stronger sides in the division this season after coming down so big clubs big grounds but my lads showed last year on numerous occasions that they can play their game no matter what the pitch the stage or the crowd
2938239 like every first game of the season though there is sure to be a really special atmosphere on saturday
2938240 itll be great for us with it being our first game back in the first division and well have a lot of fans there lets hope its a great day and a great football match
2938241 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit

2938247 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2938248 the talks will resume today after that president mbeki will come back to south
2938249 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2938250 fourteen hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
2938251 the art director suggested i stay away from darker moodier looking jazz stuff and try to keep it a little more upbeat
2938252 i wanted to do something that would convey the history of jazz or tip the hat to older styles and bring it in with the new and i also wanted something more dynamic
2938253 it was the first piece in quite a while that i felt really excited about the work
2938254 at a certain point i wasnt even that concerned about whether they would pick it or not
2938255 i know what it is to be on the brink and scratch pennies at a jazz club and festivals are no better
2938256 everyones trying to get by and the one thing that binds us together is that we all love this music
2938257 but we still need to sell tickets and consumers and sponsors have to pony up
2938258 there are a ton of festivals around the world and with all the people downloading music there have never been more people listening to jazz
2938259 hes one of the last giants of the great period of jazz in the 50s and 60s
2938260 grew up with the show and have their own wonderful memories to share
2938261 she talked about how she and her brother made their own puppets and her love of puppeteering
2938262 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2938263 over all we see this as an agreement where we can move forward together to work with verizon rather than just being a contract for three years thats the most important thing about this
2938264 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender

2938286 my attitude is if youve got relations with sudanese president omar hassan al bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur
2938287 joey cheek has just got to know that i took the sudanese message for him to the chinese government
2938288 it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you
2938289 and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish

2938292 peace has to return and civilian populations have to be protected thats the only thing and from that point of view president saakashvili accepted pretty much all the proposals we made
2938293 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
2938294 so once all qualifications are met and a thorough verification done then the u s can at any time delist north korea
2938295 we hope north korea will actively cooperate on a thorough verification so that it could be removed from the list

2938319 more than ever traditional age students are working so they are looking for this flexibility and the non traditional students love it because they can go home feed the kids take them to soccer and after putting them to bed they can do their class work

2938336 there are two factors at play the strengthening of the dollar and the military conflict
2938337 hostilities continue and that is something that worries us a great deal
2938338 as long as we do not move closer to any resolution of this as long as russian forces continue to raid or bomb inside of georgia i think the pressure on russian markets will continue

2938367 i look forward to the early conclusion to current negotiations on a comprehensive free trade agreement between australia new zealand and asean
2938368 in the lead up to the target date of concluding negotiations at the asean economic ministers closer economic relations ministerial in singapore on august 28 australia is involved in intensive bilateral negotiations with key asean countries to finalise tariff and services schedules
2938369 would be an unambiguously good thing for australia but also for asean countries and the region generally
2938370 australia regards the completion or the conclusion of a free trade agreement with asean and nz as being very very important
2938371 but its also important in the aftermath of the regrettable collapse of the doha talks in the last couple of weeks that we have a regional success
2938372 australia and indonesia are both working very hard at negotiating well to bring such a treaty to a successful conclusion which australia would very much welcome
2938373 there is significant room for growth in our economic partnership if we do more to remove barriers to trade
2938374 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
2938375 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
2938376 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
2938377 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
2938378 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
2938379 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
2938380 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties

2938399 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2938400 ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2938401 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2938402 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2938403 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2938404 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again

2938421 we went from spending 4 700 per month on fuel to 7 200 per month that has been a pretty significant impact on our budget and on our ability to continue the program
2938422 this is a unique time when were experiencing both the rise in gas and food prices ive not seen it like this before where i just didnt have a plan couldnt think of how we could make it work
2938423 i think we all know the cost of food isnt going down it will require creative thinking
2938424 for some clients its not an issue to deliver less but the ultimate effect for the people who really rely on the human contact it could be devastating
2938425 im on a level playing field with my clients ive learned so much and ive been given so many things
2938426 the most heartbreaking thing is to see them removed from their home

2938443 i think it shocked my family when the amy winehouse comparisons started each one of my relatives in turn called to warn me never to end up like her or else my mother watches over me like a hawk
2938444 none of this bothers me thats why i think this is funny i know a lot more is coming
2938445 some relationships are that intense its going to cause trouble
2938446 for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
2938447 there are thousands of models like all other models naomi campbell is the same way
2938448 if no one really cared wed say lets share the money and live this out
2938449 that wont happen everyone ive ever spoken to says i dont care about the money if you dont then all split it and the winner will lose 80 000
2938450 we are a challenger brand media platform and doing quite well but obviously sport drives a significant amount of subscriptions so the setanta deal is a cracker for us its the biggest deal in our short history and is there to drive box sales in volume making it a lot easier to allow people to sample our anytime service
2938451 no we dont we had a joint submission because were both challenger brands and therefore that made sense there are no further plans for joint activity
2938452 on two bases were quite chipper one is on the box itself the other is on the content therefore it made sense for us to at this time do a deal as big as the setanta one because at this point we really feel we can be proud of our box and our content
2938453 we have a digital switchover strategy and we believe that the setanta deal is a great marketing tool in digital switchover areas we like sky and virgin look at the digital switchover areas one by one and look at what activity we can execute there clearly sky have got the marketing muscle but this deal will undoubtedly help
2938454 existing customers get setanta free for three months and then for half price for the rest of the season at a value of around 80
2938455 i would say two things one is you only need to look at sky i was skys marketing director and one month wed be offering three months free sky sports the next month offering six months free sport and the next month wed be offering a season ticket of sport so the reality is the competition do it sky continue to do it and a lot of companies do it i dont care what other companies do i care about our customers but the reality is were in a very aggressive tough and competitive environment so its difficult to do it what weve come up with is something that has similar value not quite the same value but gets existing customers around 80 of value versus if somebody buys a box today 130 of value minus the connection fee so there is a slight gap but not as big as the headline figure
2938456 i think over time we see a point at which our offering will be a subscription model for video on demand via download we havent got a date but over time thats in our sights
2938457 we have to think about the house as a group
2938458 not to allow deaths of our compatriots to remain unpunished
2938459 from the international legal perspective the russian action could be described as a humanitarian intervention
2938460 family members believe at this point it is a medical condition that might have led to his death
2938461 the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not
2938462 if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
2938463 require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control
2938464 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2938465 it contained words that led some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2938466 however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2938467 why on earth is the bush administration trying to discourage doctors and clinics from providing contraception to women who need it
2938468 any entity taking federal funds has to comply with federal laws
2938469 to do anything less would be irresponsible we do think there should be regulations
2938470 it appears that the interaction of the abog bulletin for 2008 maintenance of certification with the acog ethics report would force physicians to violate their conscience by referring patients for abortions or taking other objectionable actions or risk losing their board certification
2938471 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion
2938472 i wrote to the acog and abog protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
2938473 not only are there clear provisions in three separate laws protecting federally funded health care providers right of conscience but doing otherwise undermines the most fundamental moral underpinning of freedom of expression and action
2938474 i asked that regulations be drafted which would enforce these long standing laws protecting a medical practitioners conscience rights

2938483 we save money by taking an extra days production out of the five day week
2938484 by doing that were saving money on downtime toilet breaks also power consumption right across the board theres a lot of areas right down to toilet paper that you save money on
2938485 few people have a formal contract when they do a house swap but you can have a written agreement so that it is clear about electricity charges extra phone bills or any accidental damage that might occur
2938486 it is really important that before you do a house swap you let your insurance company know so you know what exclusions apply to your policy and if part of your house swap means letting people drive your car you should make sure that these people are included on your policy as well
2938487 to avoid any trouble it is really important to do your homework youve got to remember that you are house swapping so you are going to be living in these peoples houses as well its really unlikely that you are going to have any damage but make sure that you have got some written rules in place before you sign any contracts

2938499 we were not only the only country that was affected we have tried all that we could but its absurd
2938500 i have to apologise i wanted to come earlier but a series of ministerial meetings have kept me away i have barely had time to sleep but i had to find time to come and see you before you started competing
2938501 every athlete will get 50 a day for 20 days it is a flat rate regardless of which day you arrive at the village
2938502 traditionally you declare a lifters category and his total but at the technical meeting here on august 7 we found new rules which stated that any category entered during the accreditation period february this year should be the one for competition
2938503 we asked them why they were telling us now and not earlier and they didnt have an answer we pleaded with the competitons secretary and even tried to seek audience with the president of the international weightlifting federation iwf but it seemed they didnt want us to see him
2938504 even mr salim musoke who is our weightlifting president in uganda tried to see the officials as did mr gabriel oloka all in vain when we got to the venue kivumbis name was not where it should be and a quick weigh in proved it the secretary was not available and the iwf office was empty
2938505 so we were asked to leave a written letter and told that our chef de mission roger ddungu should go see the officials in the afternoon
2938506 so what is going on with the weightlifter i dont want any monkey tricks here you are supposed to be representing your country not individuals
2938507 im just so excited about the time steph rice was just a little bit better but its exciting to be on the podium and to be under the old world record that just tops it off
2938508 ironically i won my first medal in athens in lane one in the 100m backstroke and here i won a silver in lane one too it was a tough race to get through but stephanie was just a bit better at finishing
2938509 its awesome im very happy 4 29 is so fast
2938510 this morning in the 400im final i had a great swim i was very excited it gave me a lot of confidence
2938511 so many girls are swimming so fast right now i think tomorrow in todays semi finals youre going to see great times and even better times in the finals
2938512 they werent able to be in athens there was a mix up so this is their first olympics theyre really excited
2938513 theyve had their phones ringing non stop everyones excited back home and that means a lot to me
2938514 kim brackin her american coach and i spoke before about getting in and having a good start and a good turn and just swimming well
2938515 when i get into the pool this is kind of my place of business i get in with a clear head and know that at the end of it ill be raising my flag for my country
2938516 if i go home over winter we dont have heated pools and theyre all outdoors so its freezing
2938517 maar de japanse amerikaanse en spaanse toeristen weten ons nog niet zo te vinden en die hopen we hier te bereiken
2938518 dat hebben we bewust gedaan om negatieve reacties uit die gemeenschap te voorkomen
2938519 ik kom natuurlijk uit de provincie maar ik ben wel wat gewend hoor hier twee huizen verderop stond een bordje van prostituee paula en toen kwam er een duitse toerist op me af en die vroeg sind sie die paula nein leider nicht haha je moet wel wat humor hebben om het hier vol te houden
2938520 unser nun schon seit ber 2 jahren andauerndes kontinuierliches wachstum ist darauf zur ckzuf hren dass wir fr hzeitig auf die richtigen themen und vor allem auf den wichtigsten differenzierungsfaktor
2938521 der weg ist das ziel zum erfolg und dass wir die richtige richtung eingeschlagen haben beweisen die zahlen nach insgesamt sechs monaten nehmen wir mit 12 prozent marktanteil den zweiten platz am sterreichischen markt ein das stimmt uns optimistisch f r die zukunft insbesondere da diese leistung auf das engagement und die motivation unserer mitarbeiterinnen zur ckzuf hren ist einige ziele die wir uns gesetzt haben haben wir bereits erreicht aber wir wollen mehr die menschen produkte und ideen daf r haben wir jetzt konzentrieren wir uns auf eine professionelle umsetzung und auf die enge zusammenarbeit mit unseren partnern und kunden

2938524 verschiedene experimente zeigten zu unserer berraschung dass max zwar durchaus eine rolle spielt aber dass myc f r viele aktivit ten max gar nicht ben tigt
2938525 its for good luck but we cant talk about it its a secret if i tell you it will ruin it
2938526 maybe its working it worked today but its too early to tell
2938527 im going to talk with my dad and my coach
2938528 i cant speak for anyone else but for me getting up in the morning and going fast is a bit of a challenge
2938529 i wasnt entirely satisfied with that race but coming in one of my goals was to get a personal best time and get a second swim and i accomplished that
2938530 im not happy with it at all but its a great setup for my 200 which is what ive been training for
2938531 i knew that i was out slow yesterday and i tried to go out faster and tried a lot harder but it wasnt faster and ended up being an overall waste of time but i knew i had to do something different and i tried i took myself out of my comfort zone and it didnt work but ive got a couple more races
2938532 life threatening undergoing several hours of surgery afterwards condition upgraded to stable early today
2938533 yesterday at this time we were given horrific news about someone that we love and care about
2938534 our knee jerk reactions were probably like any other human being we were angry we were upset we wanted to talk to our friends and families
2938535 we may see him again we may not and thats all right with us
2938536 as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot said ball
2938537 but there was definitely a moment where guys let out how they felt about hugh not being on the bench
2938538 it was a chance for everybody to open up and get that off their chests so hopefully we could re focus on what we came here to do
2938539 i feel as a guy whos played 15 years married 11 with two kids that im pretty much prepared for anything but nothing can prepare you for this
2938540 i just want my boy back this is so hard and i hope he is lost somewhere said ms munohur who holds out hope that yadav is alive
2938541 we are here for him he is not alone he has his father mother sisters and family in mauritius
2938542 he is a very smart careful and loving child with a captivating smile
2938543 i was preparing dinner and yadav wanted to go to the park and i said just as soon as i have finished cooking we will be able to go
2938544 he was so enthusiastic and said he could manage by himself and ran out i heard the door slam
2938545 i asked some boys from scotch college who said he went to the park she said
2938546 we are trying every avenue of inquiry he may have slipped into the fast flowing creek and drowned he may be lost or he may be hiding from us we dont know what the story is said senior sergeant joe connor of boroondara police
2938547 he was a lost boy in india in a bombay mumbai orphanage and his survival skills would be more than that of other nine year old boys
2938548 inspiration to adopt yadav as a seven year old from mumbai and give him a better life
2938549 he was a lost child in india and had a difficult childhood that was not normal she said
2938550 sometimes he would explain to me that he got lost on a train from kalyan to mumbai and the police took him to the ashram orphanage for his safety
2938551 whenever he sees a train he looks at the train you cant explain what it feels like as a mother
2938552 we were a very happy family and already had the idea of coming here for our childrens education and had to go back to scratch and find a home and jobs ms munohur said
2938553 supporter of people and a very successful businessman with a great enthusiasm for life
2938554 they never gave the fighters the tools they needed to perform on the world stage
2938555 i dont like what the u s is doing right now
2938556 theyre trying to make the spectacular play instead of the good play
2938557 tackling knife crime is a top priority for the met with enforcement activity taking place across the capital every day under operation blunt 2 which was launched in may
2938558 as a result more people are being arrested and charged for carrying knives
2938559 that represents 88 of all of those arrested for this offence
2938560 the mps is making major improvements in charging people caught carrying knives with the charge rate having risen to over 90 in recent weeks
2938561 the mps will continue to monitor its performance and will maintain a positive charging policy to deter people from carrying knives on the streets of london
2938562 co ordinated enforcement activity is taking place a cross all 32 boroughs under blunt 2 and we are deploying a dedicated taskforce in the boroughs most affected

2938570 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age

2938576 they told us to come out i dont know why but some of our guys are still out there in the fields
2938577 i want to go back if we lose south ossetia now it wont be for ever because we will never surrender our land
2938578 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2938579 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more
2938580 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2938581 the russians will be here tomorrow they want to show us and the world how powerful they are tomorrow it will be ukraine and nobody in the west is doing anything to stop them why were our soldiers in kosovo and iraq if we dont get any help from the west now
2938582 we are operating normally nobody has disturbed us at all

2938587 it is better that he should say goodbye and leave
2938588 my suggestion for a reasonably well educated novice would be to start with the ipcc fourth assessment report working group 1 particularly chapter 9 on understanding and attributing climate change this summarises the literature on these questions and the reference list includes hundreds of papers on both the causal link and the question of sensitivity the standard way in which these questions are addressed theres also a supplementary cd rom on sensitivity if youre really keen all this is well timed as im just working on a paper for an econ journal which has required me to go over some of this literature
2938589 hundreds of papers on both the causal link and the question of sensitivity
2938590 until the most salient features of these events for example the global patterns of carbonate deposition or the extreme polar warmth can be replicated with dynamical models forecasts of climate beyond the next century that is under extreme greenhouse gas levels should be viewed with caution and efforts to comprehend the underlying physics and biogeochemistry of the coupling between climate and the carbon cycle should be hastened
2938591 the last few words imply they cannot answer jennifers very reasonable question either
2938592 calculation of radiative forcing does not rely on climate feedbacks e g changes in albedo or atmospheric water vapour content and computationally intensive climate models are not needed
2938593 read the ipcc reports all the scientific reasearch they are based on are listed
2938594 as regards the contest i listed a number of articles on sensitivity
2938595 does this ancient study take into account that the data has been updated since then
2938596 no books the request was for peer reviewed journal articles so far i can only see three as potential contenders and one was published in 1938 interesting
2938597 on this basis carbon dioxide emissions account for 80 of the contribution to global warming of current greenhouse gas emissions as compared with 57 of the increase in radiative forcing for the 1980s
2938598 the physical basis of the projected changes in climate due to enhancement of the greenhouse effect is outlined
2938599 he reckoned the greenhouse effect would still be 97 intact so even if the h2o and co2 are parallel processes calling them cumulative makes little sense

2938611 es uno de los mejores jugadores del mundo no juega tanto y por eso no est en los primeros lugares del ranking
2938612 pero es un jugador muy peligroso es uno de los peores rivales de segunda ronda en el cuadro
2938613 los torneos son importantes cuando los ganan los que est n en el top 10 y en las olimpiadas probablemente no ha ocurrido eso pero hay ejemplos como el chileno nicol s mass creo que todos se recuerda de nico en atenas y gracias a eso pas a ser un dolo nacional

2938624 proper lessons must be learned from the past experiences of holding these shows and enough care must be taken to ensure that every participant and stake holder goes back with happy memories of the show
2938625 dont forget that gaming in indonesia affiliate programs are a great way to drive customers towards your site
2938626 you may have to pay up to 25 for an affiliate lead but in the long run youre making a hell of a lot more money than you would without affiliate traffic youll find that the top 20 of your affiliates count for nearly 80 of all your income so be sure to take care of your business partners
2938627 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
2938628 be 100 certain that your shopping cart and check out process are super easy to use
2938629 or else confused customers will simply bail out and not complete their purchase
2938630 it takes a discplined and creative approach to get your message across
2938631 and some times a little luck and good old fashioned word of mouth advertising
2938632 we spend a lot time working with our designers on the homepage
2938633 and once the home page is solid we use it as a template to create other pages on the website consistency and easy of use are absolutely paramount especially in our gaming in indonesia industry
2938634 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most gaming in indonesia users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations
2938635 the thank you page can also remind the customer of other merchandise service offers on your website which might create another sales opportunity remember not to go overboard just give them 3 or 4 other offers or coupons or else they may get confused and not ever return again
2938636 the web is the cheapeast advertising space for gaming in indonesia marketers although creatively speaking it is difficult to come up with a quality brand concept

2938639 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2938640 you only get a certain number before the preseason ends to show what you can do you try to take advantage of all of them try not to make mistakes and just try to do what the coaches ask you to do
2938641 some guys made some plays and thats what the coaches want to see
2938642 the whole offseason i was up here for almost the entire year working out and working hard
2938643 ill continue to do the things im supposed to do to become a better linebacker and hopefully it will all pay off
2938644 i just rushed up the field hard and the ball was right there
2938645 so i stripped the ball and luckily i recovered it
2938646 when you have guys like vrabel and adalius in front of you you have to make the coaches comfortable that if something happens to them you can play and perform
2938647 theres some pressure there to back them up and to fill the position that they do you can fill it like they do
2938648 same thing with guyton and redd too for that matter they really took the plays that we taught them and they practiced them and translated them over onto the field there were other things that werent quite as good that need to be corrected and improved
2938649 im encouraged and glad they had the opportunity to play as much as they did
2938650 it was a good experience for all those young linebackers
2938651 i was nervous my first game its the nfl not college any more in college you have a little bit more fun and time on your hands and here its work work work
2938652 youve got to do your job and know what youre supposed to do and pay attention to detail

2938657 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2938658 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2938659 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2938660 thats the good thing about the olympics its been a lot of fun
2938661 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country

2938663 in the second half we have continued to see strong revenue growth and we expect to achieve further improvement in 2009 however profits for 2008 will be affected by higher than expected recent investment and one off exceptional items
2938664 we already work together and so whatever collaboration if there is an opportunity we will be happy to collaborate with them
2938665 and that could be on the application level or that could be on the more fundamental operating system level
2938666 you hold in your hands a very special book an expression of modern north american herbalism coming of age
2938667 in class the effects of chemicals used in shampoos and tooth pastes and other very harmful chemicals that have been found in breast tumours were discussed i then began to realise how little information there was for consumers about the health impacts of cosmetic products another factor was how hard it was to source health supporting products once you were informed
2938668 my journey to naturopathy began in 2000 when my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumour although my mother was given surgery it was natural methods of healing that nurtured her back to wellness following her operation as i read more and more about the different healing modalities available i came across the cnm and enrolled in 2001 with the methods taught in class i learned to cure my own ibs and chronic fatigue
2938669 there has been no looking back prior to studying at the cnm and launching lovelula i worked as an accountant in the city
2938670 my studies have opened the door to a career i wake up to with enthusiasm each day i love that i am using what the cnm has taught me about natural health to help other people through my business
2938671 possible breaches of the united nations oil for food sanctions program
2938672 gsk does not believe that its employees or its agents in iraq knowingly engaged in wrongdoing regarding the oil for food programme in fact gsk went to considerable lengths to co operate with uk government authorities responsible for the uk administration of the programme and to impose anti corruption measures when dealing with intermediaries in iraq at a time when the environment was extremely volatile and difficult
2938673 astrazeneca has received a request from the sfo for documents as part of its review of the oil for food programme in iraq the company will be providing the documentation

2938678 though we expect a continued deterioration as the year goes on as american and european consumers stay at home the resilience of demand for chinas exports is still remarkable
2938679 you justify the extra expenses and you dont think about it but if you start to look at it the cell phone bill is 181
2938680 its not even an optional cost its the cost of my lifestyle its become more acceptable
2938681 kids are using cell phones at a very young age and learning about the fees associated with them
2938682 and he only drives the car on the weekend and if im in the car with him i dont want to hear the country station
2938683 they count on you forgetting and just continuing to pay as an expense
2938684 with just a few keystrokes we can not only move money from one place to another but set it up automatically and forget about it
2938685 here you are paying blockbuster youre paying netflix youre paying cable and it all adds up
2938686 a lot of things are set at prices that people say arent a lot of money its only 4 99 or its only 9 99
2938687 i had enough of people trying to hurt me and harass me
2938688 ill probably have to do it myself but i want to see all forms of bullying made illegal
2938689 we have harassment through telephone in the criminal code we have harassing people by letters we say the criminal code is silent on new technology
2938690 the laws in the criminal code were all written years ago lets update it where its necessary
2938691 id be very careful about making online bullying a crime
2938692 the most severe forms of cyberbullying are already captured in the criminal code
2938693 we do have freedom of expression in canada and that means sometimes you can say unpopular and even nasty things and there is a line thats crossed
2938694 that line is already in the criminal code and im not quite sure why we need a specific law targeting the internet
2938695 as someone who has been bullied for 11 1 2 years im not sure how you can express yourself through bullying
2938696 its something that should have been done a long time ago
2938697 if you can get charged for bullying physically you should be able to get charged in regards to the form of cyberbullying
2938698 when i brought it up with the school i kept a copy of the chat log where they threatened me
2938699 they said there were no charges that could be laid because it was online if it had happened in person they could have pressed charges that was one time when i was let down by the justice system
2938700 i know that they dont believe in criminalizing it alone
2938701 education of teachers parents and students of the new cyber playground
2938702 under every government the last resort of the people is an appeal to the sword whether to defend themselves against the open attacks of a foreign enemy or to check the insidious encroachments of domestic foes whenever a people entrust the defense of their country to a regular standing army composed of mercenaries the power of that country will remain under the direction of the wealthiest citizens
2938703 whenever an army is established it introduces a revolution in manners corrupts the morals propagates every species of vice and degrades the human character
2938704 if you have a sunscreen with an spf15 you can stay out in the sun for 15 times longer than you could without that sunscreen and not get a sunburn
2938705 there are only four approved ingredients known to block uva rays
2938706 many of the larger companies use avobenzone as a uva blocker
2938707 if youre relying on avobenzone to block uva its a trust issue
2938708 oxybenzone is a concern because it is readily absorbed by the skin and has hormone disruptive effects
2938709 we know for sure that uva rays can cause cancer
2938710 you need to apply sunscreen every few hours to be effective and you dont want to put bug repellent on that often
2938711 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
2938712 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
2938713 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
2938714 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2938715 why am i not enraged that my country has killed or hurt so many people for absolutely no noble cause in my name and with my tacit approval
2938716 but cindy it is not polite to be angry or to use such strong language in public
2938717 how can a layman know which is the strongest opinion

2938719 the goal is to make as much buzz as possible
2938720 the commercial portrays the arab as a person who is short tempered aggressive and foul mouthed
2938721 we got a request from nissan international to remove the ad and not to use it again
2938722 the gulf arabs are just a symbol for rich people i think its a great ad our role is to do our job in the best way possible we dont need to take into account the feelings of the arabs
2938723 we are sorry that there are people who did not understand the advertisement and we hope that now after the subject was clarified that they understand that it was all done with humour and without any intention to hurt anyone
2938724 i worked hard to get him mr bayh the keynote speech at the 1996 democratic convention
2938725 he gave a forgettable and self serving series of bromides that did him and clinton very little good
2938726 georgia is an extremely pro american and pro western state and represents the easternmost foothold of american western power it has also been in the russian orbit for the bulk of the past 300 years as such it is the hottest flashpoint in western russian relations
2938727 therefore this is russias chance to redefine the boundaries of the region
2938728 tactically we must watch carefully to see where the russians halt their advance and be watchful for the possibility that they push on to tbilisi
2938729 even before beijing was chosen it was made very clear to the cities that were bidding for the games that these games would have to be held in august in the traditional time period
2938730 it wasnt a surprise for beijing the ioc has agreed that summer olympics will probably continue to be held in the traditional summer period
2938731 nbc would lose a very valuable sunday night if they were carrying the olympics and the nfl at the same time its the same with the other networks on sunday afternoons none of the networks would ditch their nfl commitment for the olympics
2938732 the timing really works for them in a multitude of ways
2938733 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2938734 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
2938735 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
2938736 i didnt really know what to expect this morning because it was a hard swim last night to get into the final for two british girls to get on the podium is amazing and i am so happy for both of us its great for british swimming
2938737 it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2938738 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
2938739 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
2938740 i went out a bit slow yesterday so i wanted to go faster today and managed to hold on
2938741 im confident i like being the underdog i like going in and being someone that no one really recognises
2938742 i knew there was a small chance someone would pull out and i just smashed my pb there so im really happy
2938743 i found out last night at 10pm so that had me up for another two hours
2938744 i was mostly relieved and then i knew i could make the final im feeling a bit lucky in this meet so hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen anyone in the final is going for a medal and thats what im going to be doing
2938745 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anything that doesnt kill you makes you stronger im gaining all the experience i need so im really happy
2938746 what other country in the world would give a poor latino guy like me the opportunities ive had its unbelievable really it makes me humble and it makes me proud
2938747 yes were advocates advocates for the fruits of our research and advocates for science
2938748 those who dont advocate for implementation of approaches that work those who dont speak up for their patients are irresponsible and cowardly
2938749 when i first heard the bombs i thought this is the end of our life here we said goodbye to it
2938750 i had a nice house and four cows and now i am a homeless man
2938751 they just sit here we have to bring food to them
2938752 the old people couldnt walk and in the russian peacekeeper trucks they were shooting at us
2938753 we are really a small nation why are they georgians trying to eliminate us cant the u s see us sitting here
2938754 please let the world know that what is happening in south ossetia is disgusting
2938755 we knew that if we stayed we would be killed
2938756 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2938757 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us
2938758 plymouth have said that burnley is their most hated side and they are 300 miles away that could be because we relegated them once on the last day of the season and then spoiled their glory days when we beat them in the play offs in another season
2938759 the same thing applies to stockport i think there is a little bit of jealousy there
2938760 we go to a lot of clubs now and there is no trouble never an ounce of bother
2938761 youve got bright red lips and a pretty face a rose tattooed in a private place
2938762 keep your lonely eyes to yourself and fold away all your best clothes make sure all those mother f king boys know she loves me so
2938763 youd be like a god to us like a drug dealer all sold out of drugs you threw it away
2938764 i am a bit surprised really but my logic would be that in the last 10 or 15 years we played in lots of divisions
2938765 and when we go to these grounds in the second third or fourth division then we bring an awful lot of supporters to away games and i think that this table is possibly a sign of resentment against us
2938766 plymouth have said that burnley is their most hated side and they are 300 miles away that could be because we relegated them once on the last day of the season and then spoiled their glory days when we beat them in the play offs in another season

2938774 on october 6 via hollands mascot records a two disc set the self produced effort was recorded in part at a voz do brasil studio in s o paulo brazil
2938775 im very pleased with the result and im excited to hear it all done it was a long process a learning process and a great experience its a musical journey trough the influences i had for last 15 years of my life and at the same time its very different from everything i did so far
2938776 acht jaar eerder was ik er ook japan was een gesloten complexe samenleving na 1964 is dat ingrijpend veranderd het land stelde zich open werd anders door de sport kwam er een immense stap voorwaarts
2938777 i want to get a message across that i dont want any of my players to go
2938778 there has been a certain amount of hovering but i would hope the teams respect our situation now the season has started
2938779 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2938780 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2938781 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2938782 i think we will just let the thing settle down now
2938783 its a very expensive option but again it would be one if we got the option to speak to the lad or the opportunity to speak to the lad then who knows
2938784 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2938785 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2938786 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2938787 i think we will just let the thing settle down now
2938788 we have a good player but hopefully we will have another good player coming too
2938789 i dont know when but clearly we have problems on the left
2938790 curbs seems a bit more relaxed and he most definitely has the backing of the players
2938791 i can understand why he is under criticism hes taken a job at a football club who had a huge financial injection
2938792 people expected big things at this place and so far those massive things have not been delivered
2938793 hazelbaker hustus is right about these particular areas of concern but i believe e gaming photographic images business can still move forward and can still burst through any barriers of entry in the respective market take www ams org for example this website came out of no where to be considered one of the top 1000 websites on the web today we think that our e gaming photographic images knowledge is superior to all others and with the research skills of mccreadie rojas of www pnl gov we are sure to turn a profit
2938794 i see good things for this e gaming photographic images startup company
2938795 and you can bet the ranch that things are only going to get better
2938796 im happy to see that my collegue broaden frankforter believes in this project
2938797 this project will help all involved greatly and will move things forward dramatically
2938798 because my experience has been that e gaming photographic images companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because e gaming photographic images consumers like those found on www boeing com or www w3 org are not ready for a new paradigm
2938799 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
2938800 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd
2938801 we love using intense flash graphics for our weekly work
2938802 its good for the kids and cash wise especially with the price of gas
2938803 somebody with a wireless device in china should expect it to be compromised
2938804 feels like we have been waiting for this game for around 5 years so in that time a lot of expectation has built up if this game isnt the best thing to ever be installed on my pc im going to be more than a tad bit disappointed
2938805 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2938806 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2938807 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices

2938809 there was a big problem in that adobe flash is unavailable to the masses the only way a mere mortal can do something really cool on a web site or in a presentation is to hire a flash programmer for a lot of money
2938810 they deliver the finished project to you in a form you can never edit or change youre tethered to that programmer we came to believe that that was really a big problem
2938811 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
2938812 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
2938813 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that
2938814 first the provincial assemblies will pass resolutions calling for musharraf to quit and this will happen during this week

2938818 things have been a little crazy around the base but im here now
2938819 so you can go back to sam im sure shell be happy to see you
2938820 maybe but right now the person i want to be with is you
2938821 so none of that im fine crap if you dont mind
2938822 now we have a debriefing in five minutes and then were going to go to my place and get smashed
2938823 when colonel oneill was hit major carter immediately went to check on him
2938824 despite the fact that there were jaffa everywhere and every person was needed to fire on them and i had taken an apparently fatal hit
2938825 even i know that in the middle of a battle you dont go charging out to tend to the wounded especially if youre pinned down by the enemy
2938826 you should have stayed where you were then janet might still be alive
2938827 how do you know if you had stayed where you were that jaffa might not have got through to our position
2938828 and if you hadnt been video taping airman wells you might have seen the jaffa
2938829 well if you had been doing your job it wouldnt have mattered would it
2938830 thats rich coming from someone who considers an order to be a suggestion
2938831 you break the rules regularly and get away with it so what would one more time matter
2938832 well discuss whether major carters actions were appropriate at a later time right now lets get back on topic
2938833 carter what on earth possessed you to abandon your post
2938834 so other people were injured too did you run over and check on them too
2938835 okay ill put it another way if they had been nearby would you have gone to check on them
2938836 you let your feelings for jack override the safety of everyone else on the planet
2938837 you always let your feelings override everything regardless of the consequences
2938838 he should have to pull his weight as much as the rest of us
2938839 in fact he more than pulls his weight because he does two jobs at once whereas we usually only do one daniels had to learn how to be a soldier but have any of us learnt how to be a linguist or an archaeologist i dont think so
2938840 oh i can think of several times when it would have been handy to know what was going on
2938841 yes so tell me why have you never done anything about that
2938842 dont complain about us not learning another language daniel when you havent even learnt military procedures you still dont understand the chain of command or the concept of obeying orders
2938843 well im sorry if i have a mind of my own
2938844 unlike someone i could name at least i have the guts to go against orders that are wrong
2938845 if i hadnt done anything the enkarans would have died
2938846 isnt part of your job to offer other alternatives ones that dont involve whole civilisations dying
2938847 in hindsight we probably would have all done things differently so lets leave it at that shall we
2938848 youre always letting him get away with disobeying your orders
2938849 what makes you assume that daniel gets away with it
2938850 because you dont see me bawling him out believe me major if daniel crosses the line he does get punished but i dont advertise it because its not necessary
2938851 as a civilian though he has a certain amount of latitude
2938852 and you think that you dont get away with unprofessional behaviour
2938853 you didnt used to be a doormat carter until that whole zatarc thing i think you took what i said and made it into something more and youve let it affect your work daniels right as my second in command you have a responsibility to give me other options especially if you dont think my orders are correct but you havent been doing that since you thought that caring too much was something more im not going to say anything more on that subject except its not going to happen so get over it
2938854 you havent exactly been professional yourself colonel or you would have called me on any so called unprofessional behaviour long before now
2938855 no i havent been entirely professional ill admit that but at least i havent gone rushing out in the middle of a battle to check on you and left the rest of my team vulnerable to attack
2938856 just because i hang out with him and not you doesnt mean that its anything other than friendship
2938857 youre jealous because jack can spend as much time with me as he likes as im a civilian but he cant spend time with you because youre in his chain of command
2938858 youve always wanted more than just friendship with the colonel dont think your flirting has gone unnoticed the way you always bat your eyes at him to get your own way its disgusting
2938859 why couldnt you have just stayed ascended i was finally getting somewhere and then you had to come back and everyone fawned over you especially the colonel and suddenly i didnt exist anymore
2938860 youre all on stand down for the next forty eight hours
2938861 although some of you may be required to assist into the inquiry
2938862 i expect reports from all of you at the end of that time
2938863 you will be later on so you might as well eat something now
2938864 before i ascended janet and i were involved for awhile
2938865 yes oh we broke up well to be accurate janet broke up with me just before our mission to kelowna she said i was in love with someone else but hadnt realised it yet
2938866 she wouldnt tell me who she thought i was in love with
2938867 she always said shed tell me when i was ready to know
2938868 um i suppose that what people do in their own homes is their own business
2938869 and what would you say if i said that i was in love with a man
2938870 she knew i was in love with you before i did
2938871 geez danny one word from fraiser and you think you love me how susceptible are you
2938872 i guess we were both as clueless as each other
2938873 because i dont want our first time to be a drunken one i want it to be special
2938874 or do you normally sleep with daniel in your arms
2938875 in case it escaped your notice yesterday daniel saw fraiser die since little things like that tend to upset him i was simply trying to comfort him we may have had a little too much to drink and passed out on the couch
2938876 i wanted to talk about what you said yesterday regarding us
2938877 look carter i care about you more than i should but the same goes for tealc and daniel as a team were way too close we always have been for awhile we kinda lost our way and because of that we lost daniel for a year and we became even more lost i thought that since hed been back that wed come together again as a team but obviously i was wrong because you took something i said totally out of context and youre wanting something i cant give you
2938878 at one time yeah i thought i could have but then i realised that i didnt im sorry i should have said something sooner
2938879 so are we going to be able to work together
2938880 i think she came around to try and convince me that i was in love with her
2938881 then she saw us on the couch jumped to a conclusion and i told her that nothing could ever happen between us between her and me i mean not you and i
2938882 thats the thing daniel i wont be out there ill be in jail
2938883 daniel i doubt that carter will want to talk to you at the moment either besides the whole us thing she blames you for fraisers you know
2938884 in the meantime i believe i said something about a special first time
2938885 i simply believe in having all the facts before making a judgement
2938886 well the fact is that theyve been having an affair right under our noses
2938887 they have loved each other for some time but have never acted upon those feelings
2938888 they cant be in love jack loves me and daniel still loves share
2938889 he merely stated that he cared more than he should
2938890 which means that he loves me but couldnt say so in front of witnesses
2938891 do you believe that the two of you would be truly happy major carter
2938892 you have no interests in common and i believe you would become frustrated with oneills denseness
2938893 well he and daniel dont have anything in common either
2938894 daniel jackson however does not underestimate oneills intelligence and their souls are very similar
2938895 i believe you would be unhappy with oneill as a life partner he is not the man for you however he and daniel jackson are eminently suited as a mated couple they balance each other
2938896 but i am not you need to accept this and move on
2938897 our preliminary inquiry shows that no one thing contributed to doctor fraisers death there is no proof that major carters dereliction of duty let any extra jaffa through and its doubtful that even if doctor jackson hadnt been holding the video camera that he would have shot the jaffa in time however i am informing you as major carters commanding officer that there will be further inquiry into why she left her position which will likely lead to at best a reprimand in her record or at worst a demotion to captain and reassignment to another team
2938898 i hope colonel that whatever is going on between the two of you has been resolved
2938899 major carter and i had a talk a couple of days ago
2938900 im just wondering why i never noticed that i liked you touching me
2938901 or that you touched me more than you did anyone else
2938902 do you think thats why janet thought i was in love with you because i let you touch me
2938903 because they all die or get snaked mom dad share sarah janet you
2938904 and youve always come back to me but getting back to your point it wasnt your fault with fraiser it wouldnt have made a difference if you had been lovers
2938905 or not its just a really bad coincidence same as all the others
2938906 and you do realise that theres a precedence set for surviving loving you besides me i mean
2938907 shes still alive and hasnt been snaked and what about kera and kegan
2938908 but just as a matter of reference i wasnt in love with those three
2938909 no i wasnt in love with her i loved her but not enough to be in love with her
2938910 of not being able to hide this from everyone and what they might do if they know
2938911 then well just have to take each day as it comes and make the most of the time weve got
2938912 carter wasnt the only one upset at losing the doc but she let that override everything else
2938913 i dont pretend to know what women think but its possible that she wants you to hurt as much as she does
2938914 on whether those investigating the incident decide that she shouldnt have left her post during the battle
2938915 if it had been found that her dereliction of duty had played a part in janets death then she could have been court martialled
2938916 as it is shes looking at a reprimand demotion or possibly a delay in promotion
2938917 and she knew i was wearing the kevlar vest so the chances of me taking a fatal hit were less than usual
2938918 things are going to get messy i let her believe that her feelings were returned
2938919 because it made you feel good that sam wanted you
2938920 because i thought shed grow out of it that shed find someone better how was i to know that she wouldnt
2938921 because youre the one who keeps saying that she doesnt have a life
2938922 she has a right to be upset with you jack you lied by omission and led her on by not telling her that nothing was going to happen
2938923 she should have known because i didnt break the rules for her
2938924 how many relationships has sam had since joining the sgc she saw narim less than a handful of times orlin was only around for a matter of days martouf was never around like the rest of us on sg 1 she hasnt exactly had the chance to develop a healthy relationship with anyone she also has a soft spot for the lunatic fringe
2938925 if that was the case she could have fallen for you too you know
2938926 no im a geek not a lunatic there is a difference
2938927 dont even say it you need to talk to sam and apologise
2938928 couldnt i just send her a fruit basket or something
2938929 it doesnt apply to you youre a civilian as you keep reminding us
2938930 i work in a military environment sam of course it applies to me
2938931 of course it matters if youre in love with him then it will impact on the way you do your job
2938932 and youll distract the colonel from doing his job as well of course youre already doing that anyway given the number of times hes had to rescue you
2938933 then when is the time after colonel oneill lands in the infirmary because you were too busy making eyes at him
2938934 no youve just insinuated yourself into his life so that hes too busy looking after you to spend time with anyone else
2938935 even when you were dead he was too preoccupied with you it was always daniel this and daniel that he should have turned to me
2938936 jacks not like that he copes with grief on his own
2938937 you know he didnt even look upset at your memorial service
2938938 he also doesnt grieve in public jack keeps his emotions close to his chest
2938939 but not the way you want him to and you know that or you wouldnt be here
2938940 im not the one you should be talking to sam go talk to jack
2938941 you mean he wont tell you what you want to hear
2938942 im not going to stand here and listen to this go ahead and destroy the colonels career im sure hell thank you for it
2938943 sam was here we had words i think shes on her way round to you
2938944 im fine she thinks that im going to ruin your career because im in love with you that sort of thing
2938945 before you say anything carter id like to apologise for the way ive behaved over the last few years i let you believe that there could be something more between us and that was never the case
2938946 i think youre making a mistake getting involved with daniel
2938947 other than that is there any reason why i shouldnt get involved with daniel if i was indeed planning that
2938948 you wont be able to concentrate on the missions the way you should
2938949 so youre telling me that i should retire if i get involved with daniel because im not enough of a professional to separate my private life from my work
2938950 but if it came to a choice which would you choose
2938951 saving the world is getting old carter if i had to retiring wouldnt be such a big deal
2938952 all i said was that if i had to retire then i wouldnt make a fuss
2938953 so you dont care if everyone finds out that youre doing daniel
2938954 secondly would you really put daniel in danger with unsubstantiated rumours out of spite
2938955 no one can turn anyone else gay from what ive heard its just a latent part of ones genetic make up that isnt triggered until they meet the right person whether that person be of the same gender or not
2938956 youre dead in one of them and so is nearly everyone else on earth all indications are that it was because daniel wasnt with the program that doomed that reality and same with the second one also if daniel hadnt come up with his usual brilliant ideas then that reality would still be under the control of apophis
2938957 daniel didnt do a thing to help them i was the one who built the energy source so the other me could contact the asgard
2938958 and whose idea was it to contact the asgard in the first place daniels
2938959 maybe but how long would it have taken you think back to when we were stuck in antarctica together why did it never occur to you to try another address instead of just earths i could have died out there if daniel hadnt put the pieces together and worked out where we were
2938960 you were the expert on the gate and yet it never occurred to you that the problem might not have been with our gate granted neither of us had had much experience with the stargate at that point but still you never tried all the options you just assumed you were right even though you obviously werent
2938961 at least i dont challenge every decision that you make
2938962 and thats half the problem i dont always make the right call
2938963 youre supposed to question immoral orders not go along with them if you cant do that not to mention separate your personal life from your professional one then you dont deserve the rank of major
2938964 and you dont deserve the rank of colonel if youre going to flout the rules and screw a team member
2938965 why not you had no problems with that when you thought it was going to be you
2938966 im just pointing out a flaw in your thinking why should it be different for any of you in sg 1 if i was interested in a relationship would you be putting forward these arguments if it were tealc in question rather than daniel
2938967 just because i dont want to get involved with you it doesnt mean that im with someone else and youre going to have to accept that youre also going to have to figure out if you can deal with me not being with you in a relationship sense not to mention the fact that at some point i undoubtedly will get involved with someone else
2938968 why are you so fixated on the idea of me and daniel together
2938969 im not a monk carter i never have been i havent sat around here pining for you ive been out meeting other people and even sleeping with some of them daniel isnt even in the equation
2938970 go home carter and think about whether you really wanted me or whether you just liked the idea of someone safe someone whom you knew deep down you couldnt have because its against regulations
2938971 no you dont know now i may not be a shrink but ive noticed the way youve avoided relationships over the past seven years always falling for those who cant be around its safer that way because then you still have your freedom as well anyway im not the one for you you deserve someone who will treat you better than i do
2938972 for crying out loud carter i dont want you to leave
2938973 youre an integral part of the team however if you really feel that we cant work together that would probably be for the best
2938974 im sorry how did it happen was it off world
2938975 it was a rescue mission one of the men was badly injured and couldnt be moved janet went to help him but she a jaffa
2938976 we talked things out i think she finally understands that she and i are never going to happen
2938977 not well at first there were a few accusations thrown around but i think she was okay by the end
2938978 make lots of comments about how i was going to ruin your career because id be too busy flirting with you while we were under fire from jaffa
2938979 is this because of grief us i mean was it just comfort for you or
2938980 no it wasnt isnt whatever you mean more to me than that
2938981 i love you daniel its not a reaction to grief nor is it stress relief granted the relationship part is going to take a lot of work from both of us but im prepared to put in the effort
2938982 for everything ive said to you these past few days i know youre not to blame for what happened to janet and i shouldnt have said that you were you were quite right about me i shouldnt have abandoned my position and it was a stupid mistake that recruits make i let my personal feelings for the colonel override my duties and it wont happen again i understand that you and he are together and i dont intend on making any trouble over it
2938983 thats good to hear although you know i cant confirm or deny anything
2938984 i know and i wont tell anyone ive overreacted to everything since janet
2938985 she was my best friend daniel the only one i could really talk to you know about everything and now i dont have anyone
2938986 i dont think hed particularly want to listen to girl talk
2938987 i really am sorry daniel can we get through this
2938988 you were right sir and i was very very wrong i had no right to judge what you do with your life and im sorry for the accusations i made i hope that we can still work together all three of us and that you two will be happy together
2938989 for us to work as a team again hopefully not long
2938990 shes lost so much this week that its no wonder she got angry
2938991 your compassion for those who hurt you its annoying but admirable
2938992 major carter the investigation has found you guilty of abandoning your post while under fire due to your exemplary behaviour on other missions and your contribution to the stargate program overall you will not be demoted in rank nor transferred from the sgc however
2938993 a reprimand will be placed in your records and you will not be eligible for promotion for six months
2938994 you will also be temporarily transferred off sg 1 for a period of sixty days and youll be on restricted duties for that time
2938995 sg 1 will be assigned a fourth member for that time
2938996 i trust that an incident like this wont happen again
2938997 i mean shes still on sg 1 and a major
2938998 she just needed this to get her back on track
2938999 id better get back to the translations then dont work too hard
2939000 i need a shower give me fifteen minutes ill meet you in your quarters
2939001 and general hammond wont be putting me in for a promotion any time soon but at least its not worse
2939002 and ill be fine about the colonel and daniel too just not yet
2939003 dont ask im okay ive been better but im okay i just dont want to discuss it at the moment
2939004 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed

2939054 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2939055 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient
2939056 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2939057 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2939058 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2939059 he is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2939060 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price on his head we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2939061 it could be that he does stay with us for me it is not a problem if he stays or not
2939062 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple
2939063 i heard the crowd obviously we know now as we knew before that he could stay with us
2939064 er zou een ruimteschip kunnen zijn met de naam enterprise maar het is waarschijnlijk niet meer hetzelfde schip
2939065 de meeste personages zijn inmiddels gestorven of met pensioen maar je zult zeker bekende plekken bezoeken uit het star trek universum verwacht planeten als vulcan en bajor maar ook favorieten als andoria en qonos

2939078 trooper when you stopped the defendant were your red and blue lights flashing
2939079 did the defendant say anything when she got out of her car
2939080 doctor before you performed the autopsy did you check for a pulse
2939081 so then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy
2939082 because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar
2939083 yes it is possible that he could have been alive and
2939084 how far apart were the vehicles at the time of the collision
2939085 and was your radar unit functioning correctly at the time you had the plaintiff on radar
2939086 he told me he says i have to kill you because you

2939092 were you present in court this morning when you were
2939093 do you have any children or anything of that kind
2939094 you dont know what it was and you didnt know what it looked like but can you describe it
2939095 you say that the stairs went down to the basement
2939096 do you recall approximately the time that you examined the body of mr eddington at the rose chapel
2939097 it was in the evening the autopsy started about 8 30pm
2939098 and mr eddington was dead at the time is that correct
2939099 hes been your brother in law for years and you cant remember his first name
2939100 did you ever stay all night with this man in new york
2939101 did you ever stay all night with this man in chicago
2939102 did you ever stay all night with this man in miami
2939103 doctor did you say he was shot in the woods
2939104 no i said he was shot in the lumbar region
2939105 and what did your husband do before you divorced him
2939106 well a gal down the road had had several of her children by dr cherney and said he was really good
2939107 doctor how many autopsies have you performed on dead people
2939108 mrs jones is your appearance this morning pursuant to a deposition notice which i sent to your attorney
2939109 no this is how i dress when i go to work
2939110 now as we begin i must ask you to banish all present information and prejudice from your minds if you have any
2939111 when he went had you gone and had she if she wanted to and were able for the time being excluding all the restraints on her not to go gone also would he have brought you meaning you and she with him to the station
2939112 and lastly gary all your responses must be oral ok what school do you go to
2939113 now doctor isnt it true that when a person dies in his sleep in most cases he just passes quietly away and doesnt know anything about it until the next morning
2939114 so when he woke up the next morning he was dead
2939115 did you tell your lawyer that your husband had offered you indignities
2939116 he didnt offer me nothing he just said i could have
2939117 so after the anesthesia when you came out of it what did you observe with respect to your scalp
2939118 i didnt see my scalp the whole time i was in the hospital
2939119 i had a skin graft my whole buttocks and leg were removed and put on top of my head
2939120 i dont drink when im on duty unless i come on duty drunk
2939121 any suggestions as to what prevented this from being a murder trial instead of an attempted murder trial
2939122 the truth of the matter is that you were not an unbiased objective witness isnt it you too were shot in the fracas
2939123 officer what led you to believe the defendant was under the influence
2939124 when you take into account travel food drink and entertainment the cost of a saturday night out can soon add up
2939125 a police vehicle from elandslaagte was travelling along the n11 when it was involved in a head on collision with a golf travelling in the opposite direction
2939126 it was also subsequently determined that the occupants of the golf were four off duty police officials from the newcastle area the driver of the golf and a passenger died in the collision while the two other passengers were seriously injured

2939144 thank you for the kind offer but i can not make it this time
2939145 diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggy whilst looking for a really big stick
2939146 had a misguided and untrue view on sexuality where a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent whereas a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted
2939147 as i understand it there are no products of good quality for men on the market should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them
2939148 the true disciple puts his loyalty not with a group or another human or a new idea however good those things may be but only with his master who has called him by name
2939149 the allegations are absurd and baseless every penny that we got in aid since 2001 has been accounted for
2939150 not been passing on all the 1 billion a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
2939151 the army has been getting between 250 and 300 million reimbursement for what they do but wheres the rest
2939152 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700 million dollars a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2939153 i think he has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future

2939157 im really pleased with the two results today as wed had a few problems at oulton and we werent sure what direction to go in with the bike to make it right
2939158 we tried a few different things this weekend which seemed to work well and i ended the day with a pretty good fourth and second place
2939159 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2939160 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2939161 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2939162 a lot of people have asked me to predict the outcome of this round of bargaining and my answer is ask the minister where her government stands on the issues and i can tell you how bargaining will resolve itself it will either be amicably or with conflict based on that answer
2939163 they want to hear from her does the government believe that elementary students and teachers deserve to have the same resource base as secondary students and teachers have enjoyed were looking for a definitive answer
2939164 the course of bargaining will be determined largely by whether the government believes that the funding discrimination against elementary students is a priority or its not
2939165 im looking to them to work with us and i certainly will continue to be open to having that dialogue
2939166 im not even going to speculate on any kind of major breakdown i really think we can get back to it and we can resolve it
2939167 i think there is a hope on the teachers side that the boards will lobby the government for more money but in light of the current economic climate in this province what the catholics have accepted as far as this template is pretty generous
2939168 were absolutely committed to this its one of the focal points of this government
2939169 we intend to move in a direction that will hold young people accountable particularly young people who commit serious and violent crime
2939170 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2939171 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2939172 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2939173 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2939174 we agreed personal terms on friday and if all goes well he will sign on monday
2939175 hes a player whos the right age and who well need
2939176 hes made a commitment to portsmouth and hell be a very good acquisition hes at the right age and hell learn from playing alongside sol campbell hell gain that experience that all players need and hopefully hell be the player were looking for
2939177 the situation is not a question of money he is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2939178 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2939179 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2939180 weve a few injury niggles at the back and i am looking for some experienced cover ben is steady but he has a couple of clubs interested in him and i will have to have a think about it
2939181 over the summer i have had one or two players come back from long term injury but have had another two go out i am looking to try to add to the squad i think i need to try to strengthen
2939182 scunthorpe made it very difficult for us in the first half to get the ball down and play
2939183 all the players here are aware of the ambitions of this club this season but that first 45 minutes was a reminder to us that we might be favourites but nothing is going to be easy in this division
2939184 it was only in the second half that we finally won the right to play we created a lot of good chances and in the end i thought we deserved to win it was important for us to get up and running on the opening day but its only the first step in what is going to be a monster season
2939185 we were absolute rubbish im just relieved we got a point we didnt deserve anything more
2939186 although in fact we made more chances than stockport we were absolutely terrible we just couldnt come to terms with our system they were miles the better team throughout the game i need more players and i need to spend more time with those i have got
2939187 i thought both teams played good football and our finishing was probably the difference marc strike was terrific and it is something hes capable of producing said carlisle boss john ward referring to the strikers goal
2939188 rovers front men gave my centre backs a tough examination and overall i am very grateful for the three points because there was not a lot between the sides
2939189 sometimes it comes off other times it doesnt but those three changes changed the whole course of the game
2939190 the goals we conceded were embarrassing and millwall were no better than us so to come back like we did was very rewarding the game had looked over and i had to try something once our subs went on we totally dominated the game we showed a lot of character because most of the time you will never get back in it at 3 1 down
2939191 im glad we didnt settle for the point and went for the winner
2939192 adebayo made things happen for us throughout the game despite having five stitches in a head wound
2939193 his ball retention was excellent and besides his two goals he has played a big part in leon constantines goal i wanted to hit the ground running and we did in the end
2939194 they played tremendously well as a team and have now set a standard for themselves
2939195 we played ever so well but this is only the start one down and another 45 to go we have to produce this sort of thing consistently it was our day theres no doubt about that and we scored some terrific goals
2939196 it was all about getting the season off to the right start rather than the performance but as we are expected to put in a promotion challenging season this was a decent start
2939197 now it is important that we get into the winning habit
2939198 it was a tough game and in the first half we played very well with some good football and created some good chances but in the second half we had to show more resilience and defend when we needed to but if you had asked me before the game if i would have taken 2 0 i would have answered of course i would
2939199 the two goals that we gave away were diabolical ones to concede he groaned
2939200 i am a rockstar i got my rock moves and i dont need you
2939201 i dont know how we needed to go to penalties as we dominated possession and had good chances
2939202 carlos tevez was rightly named man of the match because he was on the go all game and a constant thorn in portsmouths side
2939203 a year ago he joined us straight from the copa america after playing for argentina and wasnt as fit as he is now hes light years ahead now im expecting big things of him this season hes got the heart to play the game is never intimidated and fights for every ball
2939204 taking the 90 minutes into consideration it was a good workout for us it would have been nice to win but we look forward to next weekend with a lot of confidence for 90 minutes it was 0 0 which against manchester united has to be considered a very good result
2939205 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over they have already got friends to speak out saying he was sleeping on their sofas
2939206 when balthazar went away in may rosetta thought it was to see his sick mum in germany but she now knows that it was to cavort with sienna in prague
2939207 im starting to think i may never have sex again
2939208 its not something i planned but i just dont get asked out any more
2939209 the hardest thing is dealing with people who think i was going out with george to further my career
2939210 in fact offers almost totally dried up people assumed i wouldnt be modelling again
2939211 for us its a fun thing the reason why scientists are here is that this is exactly what they do for work but they are doing for the love of biology and its fun beer and pizza is a big part of it
2939212 it just shows how little we know our native biology if we go across different ecosystems we find more things
2939213 but if we dont see them we dont count them no one has seen a cougar and i dont think anyone has seen a marmot this year
2939214 its pretty dirty work but its incredible to educate the public and get everyone down here especially the kids
2939215 but its also good to create baselines of the animal species of the area
2939216 we call them squirrel food we scratched back the forest floor a little bit and found them in short time
2939217 we started whistler naturalists about 10 years ago and it became apparent at the start that we really didnt know what species were here you cant conserve a species and you cant educate people about it until you know what is here
2939218 were adding to it every year some are species like lichen and mushrooms which are interesting to specialists though maybe not the general public but then we found the red legged frog last year for the first time and thats a species at risk and that can lead to conservation action
2939219 they are experts in one area of insect study so an entomologist who knows about butterflies will not know much about spiders and so on
2939220 we have 63 mammals on the overall list and weve never had homo sapiens on it so of course we added them so now theres 64
2939221 its fantastic that they are finally doing more to understand the environment and understand how sensitive it is here
2939222 the new uk website represents so much more than an aesthetic redesign the revamp has enhanced both the front and back end of the site delivering new functionality rapid ease of access to deals and tremendous additional proprietary content we believe users will find it to be a highly improved powerful travel search tool which is packed with information and all kinds of useful tips and tricks to help prep them for their journey and even help them decide where to visit it really is like your own virtual tour guide
2939223 the rapid transit from beta to full uk launch is a testament to the success of the significant redesign work and heavy investment in back end technology over the past year or so carried out by our own technology teams this has not only enabled the relaunch of cheapflights existing sites but also provides a common technology platform for additional launches we expect to launch a european site later this year as part of our strategy to extend our successful flights price search and comparison model internationally
2939224 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet thousands of
2939225 we have heard from patients that one of their major concerns is the perceived postcode lottery in access to drugs
2939226 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2939227 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2939228 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2939229 as under the russians in chechnya it looks like the communists in china are battling another form of totalitarianism to come jihadism
2939230 china will continue to pursue a policy of support to other jihadist forces including the islamist regime in khartoum
2939231 a new afghanistan with jihadists converging from central asia and other parts of the world
2939232 a turkistan islamist movement with links in central asia stretching back to afghanistan and pakistan blending taliban training
2939233 is a very different entity than china has faced in the past
2939234 beijing would be unable to use information from raiding one cell to find another this appears to be exactly what we are seeing now the central tip core uses the internet and videos as psychological tools to trigger a reaction from beijing and inspire militants without exposing itself to detection or capture
2939235 the alleged activities seem to fit a pattern within the international jihadist movement of paying more attention to china islamists have considered china something less imperialistic and thus less threatening than the united states and european powers but this began changing with the launch of the sco shanghai cooperative organization designed to monitor terrorism in russian and asia and the trend has been accelerating with chinas expanded involvement in africa and central asia and its continued support for pakistans government
2939236 opportunistically using the post 11 september environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics
2939237 they dont espouse violence they espouse sharia does china want to live under sharia do free people want to live under sharia does it matter that hizb ut tahrir wont be blowing anyone up on its way to instituting this oppressive system
2939238 i am the way the truth and the life not light as some people misquote and no one comes to the father except through me
2939239 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2939240 but the russians are not letting them withdraw they are pursuing them and people are seeing this
2939241 the russians have gained all of their military objectives this is not about military objectives this is about a political objective removing a thorn in their side
2939242 were not crazy we have no interest whatsoever in pursuing hostilities
2939243 the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified
2939244 it was a superb performance he was a constant thorn to portsmouth and it is just a pity he did not get a goal
2939245 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him
2939246 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2939247 but it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2939248 we think it was something with the water when we first got over here
2939249 the race today saturday night ryan looked pretty good for the first 200 but i dont think he had the stamina to really finish the race like he wanted to
2939250 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2939251 si te da pereza pensar imagina lo que te costara vivir
2939252 in my career id like to become a strike bowler and a new ball bowler for england but you have to earn that right
2939253 im thoroughly enjoying test match cricket and hopefully a haul will come at some stage
2939254 its stood me in good stead because i think after about 10 one day internationals i only had about five wickets and at that time i was thinking about how i was going to get international wickets and after 30 ive got 40 odd now
2939255 at the oval with the massive square its quite a quick scoring ground and if we get a head start and bat well we should knock off 197
2939256 the bowlers have not really been where they can be so this will be a good chance for them to hit their straps and bowl like we know they can
2939257 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
2939258 inform a la polic a bases militares y el ministerio de defensa
2939259 me tratan con los avistamientos durante treinta a os y nunca hab a visto nada como eso humanidad se enfrenta a algo que no sabe c mo explicar
2939260 20 year old kid trapped in a 47 year old mans body
2939261 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
2939262 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
2939263 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
2939264 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience

2939272 companies will once again be considering whether its time to block facebook in the workplace not just for the usual productivity reasons but because of the security threats that sites like this may pose to their enterprise
2939273 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access websites like facebook and myspace during office hours if workers are allowed to be given access to these sites then its vital that they do not put their personal and corporate data at risk and are protected from web based infections
2939274 the best defense is for businesses to defend themselves with a web security and control appliance which can filter internet access and prevent the downloading of malicious code

2939335 efforts are underway to encompass other fellow colleges in countries like namibia and lesotho to accommodate students from zimbabwe
2939336 we are also seeking to increase the number of students at universities in south africa such as venda nelson mandela metropolitan cape peninsula rhodes kwazulu natal witwatersrand and walter sisulu as demand for presidential scholarship fund assistance continues to grow
2939337 this year we received more than 6 000 applications and we are in the process of sorting them out so that deserving students get the funding
2939338 the names of successful applicants will be released at end of this month in time for the opening of most universities in september
2939339 before this zimbabwe had traditionally been regarded as sub saharan africas second most industrialised nation after south africa obviously having inherited a well developed infrastructure and financial system at independence in 1980
2939340 one of the major reasons for these low rentals is the rapid daily decline in the zimbabwe dollar which has led to loss of confidence in the local currency in any business transaction
2939341 in zimbabwe dollar terms however rentals have increased significantly but the increases have lagged inflation because of the 2007 rental freeze and the time it takes for new rentals to be negotiated
2939342 the commercial rent regulations have been relaxed a bit by the coming into effect of statutory instrument 1a of 2007 which allow parties to negotiate on rentals and reviews but still this has not been enough as rentals can best be increased on a monthly basis whilst the local currency continues to lose value on a daily basis
2939343 we urge motorists especially public transport drivers not to speed and overload to avoid accidents and loss of life
2939344 potential participants should view the fair as an opportunity to establish and deepen commercial relations with a neighbouring country
2939345 the opportunity to strengthen trade between mozambique and zimbabwe is there given that we are neighbours and that the transport routes are well established
2939346 mozambique has also become a top trading partner of zimbabwe ranking eighth as our export market
2939347 co operation between governments and the private sector in africa leaves a lot to be desired and if significant progress is to be made in africas development a more common world view between both sectors has to be established
2939348 while significant progress has been made there are certainly major challenges in the implementation of nepad particularly with regard to the need to scale up private sector participation and investment
2939349 with very few exceptions financing of infrastructure projects under the framework of nepad has largely been dominated by development finance institutions and international actors including india and china while this is certainly a welcome development it also represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the private sector in africa
2939350 it is a shame for some other countries in the region to speak negatively about zimbabwe there is dialogue currently taking place in the country this is a process that all of us are keen to see succeeding
2939351 countries in the region should not mimic outside forces and join on the bandwagon of demonising zimbabwe
2939352 the people of zimbabwe have a right to chart their future and there should be no interference provocation and meddling by outside forces
2939353 all countries in the region have an interest in zimbabwe and wish to see the country being successful thus we encourage dialogue among the people of zimbabwe
2939354 it is unfortunate and disappointing for some countries in the region to speak negatively about zimbabwe
2939355 thirst for education was one of the shining marks of zimbabweans even during colonial times
2939356 the fact that zimbabwean professionals are found all over the globe in challenging positions is a credit to our nation
2939357 there should be creativity and innovation in finding solutions to prevent the labour migration currently taking place
2939358 incentives related to transport housing and good working conditions should also benefit those in the education sector
2939359 tertiary institutions should ensure that all members of society access quality education through the integrated skills outreach programme this should include even the disabled in the community so that they can be productive
2939360 a country which does not possess trained and skilled manpower experiences considerable difficulty in knowing where to start from
2939361 we do not want zimbabwe and namibia to fall into the same predicament
2939362 we should therefore do everything in our capacity to transmit wisdom and knowledge to the young so that they can participate meaningfully in the development of our societies
2939363 to date a total of 345 students from namibian have graduated from bttc alone we are really proud of this record a tracer study revealed that our products are doing very well in namibia
2939364 we are looking forward to increasing our market share here and we are making efforts to develop relations with some other players in the industry
2939365 the company had a great start since we moved into the country and the future is bright
2939366 the network coverage in the country still falls far short of world standards
2939367 that in itself is where our opportunities will come from

2939374 every district will get an elephant and a buffalo and the meat would be shared among the eight districts
2939375 there is something of mismatch on what the business community is doing the driving factor is the parallel market
2939376 the issue of foreign currency pricing as an issue is not yet solved there is need for the central bank governor to address and we are geared to meet him
2939377 once we have the correct pricing of foreign currency we are done with inflation
2939378 we are moving to increase the area under irrigation as you can see the dam is still 95 percent full and we are heading for the rainy season we are therefore seeking to utilise the water in development projects
2939379 government is now developing two more irrigation schemes to draw water from the dam
2939380 there are 52 hectares of land being developed for irrigation while in chikomba where the larger part of the dam is located another 90 hectares of land is being similarly developed
2939381 i think the development of the existing irrigation scheme has been affected by lack of co ordination among farmers and various agro related institutions such as agritex as well as poor marketing strategies of the produce
2939382 this has resulted in a poor cropping pattern that has been dominated by low value cropping resulting in stunted development in the scheme
2939383 mit allen diplomatischen mitteln muss jetzt verhindert werden dass der s dkaukasus zu einem m rderischen schlachtfeld wird und in krieg und zerst rung versinkt
2939384 die bundesregierung muss darauf dr ngen dass daf r die mechanismen der osze zum tragen kommen
2939385 wenn die kriegerischen kampfhandlungen nicht umgehend von allen seiten eingestellt werden droht der konflikt um unabh ngigkeit auch die abtr nnige republik abchasien zu ergreifen neben der uno m ssen jetzt auch die staaten der nato ihren politischen beitrag leisten sie sollten sich allerdings daran erinnern wer den albanern im kosovo v lkerrechtswidrig das recht auf lostrennung zubilligt kann den osseten und abchasen nicht erkl ren weshalb sie dasselbe nicht haben sollen es war vorauszusehen dass die anerkennung der abtrennung des kosovo andere unabh ngigkeitsbestrebungen ermuntern wird ihre ziele ebenfalls ohne r cksicht auf das internationale recht zu verfolgen umso gr er ist die verpflichtung der nato staaten jetzt die streitenden parteien aus diesem krieg herauszuholen und an den verhandlungstisch zur ckzuf hren
2939386 die nato sollte die einbeziehung von georgien ad acta legen und ihre einkreisungsstrategie gegen ber russland einmotten ein partnerschaftliches verh ltnis sieht anders aus
2939387 wir fordern alle seiten auf die unertr gliche gewalt sofort zu beenden eine waffenruhe zu vereinbaren und eine friedliche l sung zu suchen

2939398 believe it or not even with all this i was still trying to protect bruces anonymity
2939399 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
2939400 he is a revenge killer when he feels he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
2939401 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and letting the fbi now be able to prosecute him for the murders and it was all my fault
2939402 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2939403 i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2939404 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2939405 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2939406 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2939407 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2939408 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2939409 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2939410 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2939411 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
2939412 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2939413 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2939414 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2939415 this is one of the hardest moments of my career and one of the hardest decisions ive had to take
2939416 im going to talk with my dad and my coach
2939417 hes tougher than all four of us by far hes battling polio from childhood too
2939418 its a battle all the time for him and he just never lets it show hes hurting inside but you never can tell
2939419 this is a good thing it was a reminder to me that i must also do what i can
2939420 if we follow in the others steps were not going to come in front of them
2939421 they want him here he wants to be here its good for him to be here the fact hes here is not because its something hed like to do its important for the team and him
2939422 we know that its worked for so many athletes in the past thats a motivation in itself
2939423 but certainly in his situation now with his health hes an incredibly strong person dedicated and very much a fighter i think we draw a ton off of that its fantastic to have him in china
2939424 hell tell us that were doing bad and that his grandma could do better but its always in such a positive way that you never really get angry at him
2939425 he just really does a good job of keeping us positive even in light of his situation its really amazing
2939426 if you have a glad coach out on the motor boat you have a better coach happy rowers are better rowers
2939427 well show you at the end of the week something pretty spectacular
2939428 i think weve come together as a crew and its exciting for all four of us and bent as well
2939429 were right where we need to be and the rest of the field is extremely tight around us
2939430 its for good luck but we cant talk about it its a secret if i tell you it will ruin it
2939431 maybe its working it worked today but its too early to tell
2939432 everybody knows i havent raced since nationals but i think its been good for me
2939433 since i was a small boy ive had this wish to win the olympics
2939434 others dream of being footballers i dreamed of being dartagnan and i kept on dreaming for 25 years
2939435 we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old the government backs them and the federation runs away
2939436 we were taken to the police holding facility and interrogated for several hours before we were deported
2939437 i trained my ass off for the last 10 weeks and gave everything i could if you lose to someone whos better than you you cant complain im in the best condition ive ever been in and i lost to a better guy
2939438 i didnt have to hear his name as soon as you hear kazakhstan youre fighting one of the best in the world
2939439 i stopped working 10 weeks ago to train im in debt here just to buy presents for everyone back home thats a problem with the money system for our top athletes im in china and ive got to find a store that takes credit cards to buy a present to take home
2939440 sport in canada is treated like a hobby anywhere else its a profession i speak to kids in school and i say follow your dreams i wanted to be a fighter and make the olympics and i went out and got that with determination if id done the same and become a doctor or a lawyer i wouldnt have to borrow money for a cab who knows i could have been a doctor and lawyer both because ive been doing this for 16 years
2939441 they put in 3 million and this year qualified 9 10 11 fighters theyre doing really well in canadian boxing we say give us funding and we can produce the government is saying produce and then well give you funding its the egg and the chicken
2939442 the guys who arent here i feel the system has failed them
2939443 there are numerous teams here that could get on a roll and make this very competitive
2939444 its not so much that ive been here and they havent its more like were all one team
2939445 we have three players who have been in four olympics

2939460 of course you have to have chemistry and you have to trust your partner and thats what we developed throughout the years
2939461 first of all because i am back playing again second because i am playing in the olympics and third because i am with my national team with my friends in the biggest tournament in the world
2939462 sometimes you have to make decisions that are sometimes difficult to do but when you feel inside thats what you have to do its better to do it

2939479 it can happen to anyone so i guess i made the best of it
2939480 i wasnt feeling great at all i shot really well so i was happy with that performance and coming out here today ive been feeling better and better

2939482 we were trying to feed off that maybe our adrenaline might have got too high maybe we got to thinking about the moment
2939483 but for italy to shoot a 59 against us thats not fair thats hard to beat you can only beat that with a perfect score and not many teams can shoot a perfect score on command

2939592 fda has found that the importation of prescription drugs from foreign sources is not safe medical practice and our position regarding importation is based on fdas concern surrounding the strength quality and purity of these medications

2939594 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2939595 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2939596 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2939597 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2939598 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2939599 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2939600 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2939601 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan

2939609 your democratic governments sole motto seems to be visit u s before u s visits you because you just came from the usa and prime minister gilani is going to usa too on the other hand if u s wants to visit invade pakistans tribal areas then so be it nato military commander in afghanistan has said approximately 400 000 troops required in afghanistan for the security and stabilization of the country please comment
2939610 pakistan will not allow any one to operate on its territory and we can deal with things better

2939629 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2939680 he was a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
2939681 the south pacific was where greg made his home his enthusiasm and love of our region was very evident in the way he went about his work
2939682 greg was a strong advocate for the pacific and his passing is a great loss
2939683 greg was one of natures gentlemen who took over the helm of the forum secretariat at an important point in its history guiding the organisation through the establishment of the pacific plan aimed at increasing regional cooperation
2939684 as the first non pacific head of the pacific regions premier policy organisation greg had much to prove and he was more than equal to the challenge

2939696 to put the world in order we must first put the nation
2939697 for congress the media and americans in general this report should have been not just a wake up call but a shout for an all nighter with nodoz
2939698 why didnt we do that fantastic a job why they dont even know they are in the belly of an empire
2939699 i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
2939700 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2939701 secondly those who favour this attack now will tell you candidly and privately that it is probably true that saddam hussein is no threat to the united states
2939702 but they are afraid at some point he might decide if he had a nuclear weapon to use it against israel
2939703 the real agenda in all of this of course was to redraw the political map of the middle east
2939704 i think there are a number of issues at play theres a number of competing agendas one is the remaking of the map of the middle east for israeli security and my fear is that when it becomes increasingly apparent that this was all done to make sharons life easier and that american soldiers are dying in order to enable sharon to impose his terms upon the palestinians that people will wonder why it is american boys and girls are dying for israel and that will undercut a strategic relationship and a moral obligation that weve had towards israel for 55 years i think its a terribly flawed strategy
2939705 this media blackout re seymour hersh story it seems to me adds up to a remarkable non response to claims that if true should gravely concern congress the media and the nation in this case no one in the mainstream evidently cares not yet anyway to pay the slightest attention
2939706 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of andrew jackson
2939707 the point is not that jews have a monolithic perspective
2939708 vichy america also loren re in addition to my above post
2939709 vichy america also loren re we should end all acceptance with the fascist regime behind
2939710 held accountable for what happened under his watch he should also be exposed for full knowledge and culpability of these
2939711 is in many instances the effect of paying too little for the labor that produced it the consequence of which is that the working hand perishes in old age and the employer abounds in affluence
2939712 all those who hive been thrown out of their natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property
2939713 whenever there are in a country uncultivated lands and unemployed poor it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate the natural right the earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on if for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated we must take care that other employment be provided for those excluded from the appropriation if we do not the fundamental right to labor the earth returns to the unemployed
2939714 theres a real gap out there in terms of thinking people think we should buy organic only if we are eating the product
2939715 its ironic that people will pay more money for organic food for their dinner plate because they are afraid of chemicals but then they will buy conventionally grown flowers that are covered in chemicals for the centerpiece of their dinner table and those chemicals will catch up with people maybe not through their mouths but through the water and air
2939716 as long as we have bombers and missiles in the air we will hit irans nuclear facilities
2939717 major strikes against iran occurred last night at least 25 targets were hit by cruise missiles and us and british bombers the president will give an address to the nation at nine this morning some reports say two bombers did not return to base
2939718 my fellow americans last night us and coalition pilots carried out strikes on irans nuclear production facilties i took this decision with great pain but our intelligence showed iran was very close to developing nuclear weapons capability and importantly has on mnay occassions threatened to use this capability against other nations including our good ally israel i know these developments are alarming to many and i share your sadness but keep this clear we can not allow terrorists and terrorist supporting nations to prevail i would like to send out my admiration for our brave coalition forces fighting side by side in the gulf our thoughts are with you and with your families god bless america
2939719 the left is responsible for our humiliating defeat and the loss of millions people killed in cambodia
2939720 screw up needs a reality check or wake up call and fast
2939721 i would have won in iraq if the iranians had stayed out of it it was the iranians who killed the american troops not me
2939722 supplying the weapons that are killing a growing number of american soldiers in iraq
2939723 waging war against the united states and trying to kill as many american soldiers as possible
2939724 hey lets roll the dice and try a totally new country whos going to stop us
2939725 bush has placed himself in a neoconservative bubble that operates with its own false sense of reality
2939726 they are ordered by the president to the nations capital where they will operate high tech weapons systems against any potential air threat
2939727 just another think tank no more important than the dozens of others that come and go in washington
2939728 if i work a little harder and make it a little nicer its more rewarding

2939755 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2939756 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2939757 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2939758 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2939759 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2939760 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2939761 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2939762 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2939763 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2939764 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
2939765 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
2939766 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
2939767 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
2939768 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2939769 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2939770 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2939771 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2939772 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2939773 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2939774 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2939775 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2939776 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2939777 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2939778 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2939779 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2939780 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2939781 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2939782 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2939783 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2939784 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2939785 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2939786 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2939787 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2939788 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2939789 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2939790 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2939791 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2939792 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2939793 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2939794 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2939795 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2939796 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2939797 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2939798 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2939799 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2939800 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2939801 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2939802 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2939803 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2939804 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2939805 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2939806 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2939807 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2939808 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2939809 mom we have to go back to the same city you can get a ride back with us stay with your dad
2939810 i dont want jim driving all that way back alone
2939811 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
2939812 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
2939813 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2939814 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2939815 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2939816 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2939817 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2939818 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2939819 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2939820 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2939821 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2939822 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2939823 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2939824 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2939825 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2939826 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2939827 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2939828 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2939829 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2939830 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2939831 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2939832 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2939833 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2939834 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2939835 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2939836 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2939837 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2939838 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2939839 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2939840 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2939841 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2939842 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2939843 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2939844 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2939845 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2939846 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2939847 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2939848 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2939849 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2939850 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2939851 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2939852 just so you all know we did set a record
2939853 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2939854 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2939855 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2939856 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2939857 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2939858 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2939859 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2939860 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2939861 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2939862 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2939863 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2939864 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2939865 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2939866 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2939867 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2939868 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2939869 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2939870 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2939871 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2939872 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2939873 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2939874 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2939875 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2939876 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2939877 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2939878 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2939879 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2939880 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2939881 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2939882 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2939883 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2939884 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2939885 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2939886 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2939887 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2939888 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2939889 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2939890 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2939891 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2939892 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2939893 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2939894 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2939895 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2939896 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2939897 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2939898 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2939899 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2939900 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2939901 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2939902 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2939903 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2939904 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
2939905 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2939906 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2939907 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2939908 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2939909 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2939910 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2939911 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2939912 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2939913 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2939914 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2939915 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2939916 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2939917 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2939918 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2939919 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2939920 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2939921 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2939922 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2939923 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2939924 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2939925 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2939926 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2939927 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2939928 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2939929 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2939930 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2939931 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2939932 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2939933 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2939934 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2939935 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2939936 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2939937 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2939938 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2939939 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2939940 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2939941 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2939942 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2939943 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2939944 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2939945 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2939946 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2939947 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2939948 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2939949 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2939950 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2939951 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2939952 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2939953 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2939954 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2939955 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2939956 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2939957 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2939958 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2939959 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2939960 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2939961 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2939962 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2939963 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2939964 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2939965 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2939966 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2939967 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2939968 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2939969 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2939970 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2939971 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2939972 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2939973 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2939974 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2939975 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2939976 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2939977 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2939978 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2939979 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2939980 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2939981 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2939982 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2939983 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2939984 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2939985 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2939986 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2939987 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2939988 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2939989 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2939990 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2939991 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2939992 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2939993 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2939994 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2939995 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2939996 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2939997 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2939998 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2939999 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
