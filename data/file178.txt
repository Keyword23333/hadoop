1780015 they date the fossil by dating the rocks which are dated by the fossil

1780028 i just want to see people happy whatever i can give whoever i can connect them to ill do that
1780029 what i find out from stories and testimonies of people is that our events start to open the eyes of people through other people sharing
1780030 and through the networking part where they pass their business cards they start to get to know people personally the atmosphere is for professional people to be comfortable relax
1780031 they bring that passion to their mates and their family and it brings more power to help the community and then that spreads worldwide
1780032 and with that we can change the world thats my vision everybody should live their dream

1780047 education is vital to breaking the cycle of poverty when children are hungry trying to learn becomes even more difficult
1780048 when i had the opportunity to create a project that would make a difference to the communities by providing food and support for educational programs it seemed a natural thing to do
1780049 cause very much appreciates people who want to raise money to assist communities where we work
1780050 it is great the descendants are choosing to make a difference in sierra leone even more inspiring these are young people working to make our world a better place the concert is going to be amazing and cause appreciates all the hard work being put into it
1780051 without some form of intervention breaking the poverty cycle a child is unlikely to have access to formal education is quite likely to be impoverished and will probably not live beyond his or her 40s
1780052 cause provides many direct and tangible opportunities to communities in the koinadugu district children get a quality education and adequate nutrition local people are trained and employed water and infrastructure projects are undertaken and social and economic spin offs are seen throughout the region
1780053 our kids are very fortunate to live in canada and to have all privileges that come about as a result
1780054 while i wanted them to be grateful for what they have and where they live i also wanted them to understand poverty is not something that only exists overseas its here in our own backyards this is an opportunity for our kids to use their artistic abilities to help others less fortunate
1780055 we are delighted to be part of this exciting event
1780056 the fact it is kids helping other kids makes it even more meaningful for us
1780057 the program continues to grow due to the great need in our community
1780058 our goal is to help provide children with nutritious food so they can concentrate on school work and not on their hungry tummies

1780343 both players have shown throughout their careers that they are fantastic leaders and we want that to continue with saracens steve is the current england captain while andy was great britains youngest ever league captain so that goes to show the qualities they will bring to the roles

1780347 its not something you ever expect but i am really looking forward to it ive already been really impressed by my time at saracens and we have a tremendously skillful and hard working group of players at this club
1780348 sharing the captaincy with a player like andy farrell is a huge honour as he has achieved so much in his career and its going to be great playing alongside him and the rest of the boys theres a lot of hard work ahead of us and with the support of the highly impressive coaching staff at saracens it can be a very exciting year
1780349 we sent the kickers out to dolphin stadium to get some work out on the dirt out there the goal posts are up for the dolphins game against tampa bay so it is good for our guys to get used to kicking on that field

1780364 at first i thought it must have been a coincidence there must be thousands of men with huge glistening pectorals and shoulder length golden hair whose steadfast gaze betrays immeasurable fathoms of passion
1780365 the most important is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
1780366 plainly and consciously in the moral tradition of his people
1780367 for jesus too love is a matter of will and action but he demands decision and readiness for god and for god alone in an unconditional manner which startles his hearers
1780368 a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he fell among robbers who stripped him and beat him and departed leaving him half dead now by chance a priest was going down that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side so likewise a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a samaritan as he journeyed came to where he was and when he saw him he had compassion he went to him and bound up his wounds pouring on oil and wine then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him and the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper saying take care of him and whatever more you spend i will repay you when i come back which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers
1780369 well you should love your family friends townspeople fellow nationals and then foreigners in that order
1780370 who is nearest to the one in need of help
1780371 whoever stands closest to the man in need has a neighbourly duty towards him three men are equally near to the man who has fallen among thieves in his distress which of them fulfills his neighborly duty the alien samaritan
1780372 he fulfills his neighborly duty whose heart detects the distress of the other at the decisive moment the two others hold back and thus violate their neighbourly duty what is demanded is the most unsentimental imaginable readiness to help the samaritan does in all sobriety what the moment demands
1780373 you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
1780374 i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you in order that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven
1780375 while we were enemies we were reconciled to god through the death of his son

1780380 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1780381 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1780382 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1780383 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1780384 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1780390 when fuel cost represents as much as 50 60 per cent of total ship operating cost such an increase cannot be taken lightly
1780391 rising oil price and its impact on the shipping industry staying afloat in a sea of challenge
1780392 if the oil price goes to the us 200 rm656 per barrel level the transport cost to ship a standard 20 foot container from shanghai in china to the us for example could go up to us 15 000 rm49 200
1780393 there needs to be a more dynamic formulation to address the issue
1780394 up until this moment our revenues are still trending upwards and we are not contemplating any reduction in our prices
1780395 the groups brands are doing well generally and year on year all brands have had positive same stores sales growth currently our vincci label is still the best performer in revenues
1780396 i can hope but i really cannot say for sure what is perhaps more certain is that for the coming year we should still remain profitable
1780397 sales promotions will be on as per schedule and margins from these should not be any different from those earned in previous years

1780402 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1780403 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1780404 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1780405 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1780406 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1780407 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1780408 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1780409 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1780410 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1780411 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1780412 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1780413 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1780414 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1780415 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1780416 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1780417 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1780418 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1780419 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1780420 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1780421 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1780422 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action

1780633 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1780634 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1780635 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1780636 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1780637 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up
1780638 theyre the best experts to predict what theyre going to need to manage their area of operation
1780639 as far as the activity going on here in san diego the agents are needed
1780640 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1780641 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1780642 the gains from restructuring will be offset by the fact that plug is ramping up the selling general and administrative expenses on the sales side there will be a relative not absolute gain
1780643 akeena reported very sluggish revenues and margins for the quarter leading us to believe that business will be challenging for the balance of fy08
1780644 we are modernizing the sugar industry but in no moment are we going to compete with food
1780645 we are producing around 100 million liters and with modernization we are going to double production
1780646 our country has begun an accelerated drive to increase alcohol production modernizing existing distilleries and installing new ones to increase by five times installed capacity
1780647 if authenticated these images could clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
1780648 we are in contact with the colombian authorities to ask for further clarifications
1780649 we regret the government and the president were not given all the information at the time
1780650 it does not say that he did any damage to national security
1780651 we are modernizing the sugar industry but in no moment are we going to compete with food
1780652 we are producing around 100 million litres and with modernization we are going to double production
1780653 our country has begun an accelerated drive to increase alcohol production modernizing existing distilleries and installing new ones to increase by five times installed capacity
1780654 while informal contact between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili will continue we have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran
1780655 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1780656 i am not going to guess how long this will take and where it may ultimately lead
1780657 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1780658 iran has a clear choice engagement or isolation we regret that irans leaders appear to have chosen isolation if iran continues to refuse to come to the negotiating table the international pressure on iran will only grow
1780659 the path of dialogue remains open but in absence of a clear response iran is choosing to expose itself to new sanctions
1780660 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a
1780661 the election law should not be held hostage to the kirkuk problem
1780662 it is possible a special session could be held before this time but this is unlikely
1780663 an important opportunity to pass an elections law was missed today
1780664 our stance is to go ahead with the bill and not postpone it with great regret what happened has happened and it was not our fault
1780665 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
1780666 contradict irans publicly stated policy of supporting the iraqi government and must cease
1780667 the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq in order to distract the attentions from the sources of u s failures in that country
1780668 violent incidents and casualties have declined and we have witnessed the improved performance of iraq security forces during a series of operations
1780669 the u n has been doing all it can to urge practical compromises
1780670 a failure to come to agreement on a law at this time would be a major setback not only for the prospects of elections this year but for the larger process of national reconciliation in iraq
1780671 we were subject to a completely unprecedented and unpredictable closure of the world credit markets

1780678 i congratulate all of our republican candidates for the spirited campaigns that they ran in this important election year all of our republican candidates understand that the people of missouri are looking for elected leadership that will improve their lives and move our state and country forward
1780679 in missouri we have been blessed with republican leaders who focused on tackling inherited democrat messes by solving our states budget crisis making education our number one priority and fixing a broken social welfare system that was bankrupting our state and not providing the kind of quality care that missourians expect and deserve
1780680 today we elected leaders at all levels of government who are committed to conservative principles of governance that include lower taxes fiscal discipline economic growth respect for human life and limited government
1780681 the republican party of missouri understands that times are tough
1780682 we are pleased that kenny hulshof will join senator mccain at the top of our ticket kenny is an incredible man of integrity who understands what it takes to work with republicans and democrats to deliver results for the people of missouri

1780711 test of effect from future in large hadron collider a proposal
1780712 such a cancellation after a huge investment is already in itself an unusual event that should not happen too often we might take this event as experimental evidence for our model in which an accelerator with the luminosity and beam energy of the ssc will not be built
1780713 how could you ever design an experiment that would disprove future causal influence on a current condition

1780718 como un hecho lamentable que enloda a la imagen de la alica da educaci n p blica

1780720 este un hecho aislado y puntual no podemos generalizar porque la mayor a de los profesores del pa s tiene un trato muy diferente con sus alumnos y espero que el hecho no se transforme en una oleada de denuncias constantes en la regi n y el pa s
1780721 lo ptimo es indagar que motivos llevaron a que la situaci n decantara en ese di logo entre profesor y alumna y corroborar que sea un punto negro dentro del sistema educativo pues ser a a n m s preocupante que a ra z de esto se reciban m s denuncias que nos lleven a concluir que el denostar a las personas y ni os en las aulas de clases sean una constante

1780726 we completely agree that regular preventative inspections are a good idea in our table we simply recorded that according to the bromley hospitals nhs trusts own figures pest controllers have been called in 74 times

1780729 coders who explore technology through innovation and research play a vital role in developing and securing the software and hardware we use everyday yet this important work can be stymied by bogus legal threats
1780730 effs coders rights project will provide a front line defense for coders facing legal challenges for legitimate research activities
1780731 those of us doing research on computer security and privacy need to be able to discuss and publish our work without fear of legal threats
1780732 the coders rights project will give critical legal help to programmers and developers who do the hard work in keeping technology robust and users safe
1780733 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1780734 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1780735 location information collected by cell phone companies can provide an extraordinarily invasive glimpse into the private lives of cell phone users courts have the right under statute and the duty under the fourth amendment to demand that the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before seizing such sensitive information
1780736 this is only the latest of many cases where eff has been invited to brief judges considering secret surveillance requests that arent supported by probable cause we hope this court recognizes the serious fourth amendment questions that are raised by warrantless access to cell phone location information and affirms the magistrates denial of the governments surveillance request
1780737 this is a novel and unprecedented response to what everyone recognizes as a tragic situation
1780738 the cfaa is aimed at penalizing computer trespassers but under the governments theory the millions of people who disregard or dont read the terms of service on every website they visit could face computer crime charges thats a big blank check to give federal prosecutors
1780739 websites terms of service are notoriously frivolous and overreaching often hard to find and routinely written in legalese bound to confuse a non lawyer many courts have found them unenforceable in civil cases they certainly should not be the basis for a criminal prosecution
1780740 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
1780741 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
1780742 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route

1780772 im not completely clear on the reasons to this day
1780773 the game universe itself is set all over the planet
1780774 and even off it everywhere from underwater to outer space unlike city of heroes which is based solely in a city were taking you everywhere for instance monster island
1780775 monster island is not surprisingly a place where all the giant monsters of the world are stored
1780776 back in the 1970s the monster maker was famous for creating giant monsters that attacked the planet until with the help of bureau 17 japans agency specializing in giant monsters created this island reserve to hold all these creatures that are night indestructible they tend to escape captivity a lot but nevertheless its the best solution they had
1780777 we can do better and were incredibly well placed to drive success in the region weve got to make sure we tailor our resource needs to the games we are making
1780778 really work hand in glove with developers across the whole suite of different size and shape companies in the territory today
1780779 the idea is to use different gaming concepts gaming technology used for visualization but most importantly gameplay those kinds of components can create a traning situation that is motivating
1780780 from car shows to daytona bike week from cross country rides to cruise night users can find the information they need at the site and make connections plan and book their trips and tell everyone about it users may share pictures videos information and make new friends or even reconnect to old ones the site shares the latest related industry news and offers users the opportunity to blog about things that matter to them
1780781 i am excited to have this opportunity to be part of this company

1780787 shows that others have been leading in the innovation space for many years now it wasnt long ago that emc said they dont recommend thin provisioning and weve had it for almost five years
1780788 not a lot its becoming clear to customers who do any analysis of the thin provisioning capabilities that emc and hitachi put together know they dont reflect the kind of ease of use and automation necessary to implement this efficiently you end up with what we call chubby provisioning that is it enhances operational overhead risk

1780793 i want to renew the spirit of america and make government work for the people again during my first term in congress i pledge to the voters of the 2nd district that i will fight for each of these issues so that we can move america forward
1780794 i guarantee this will be the only time im compared to john edwards we dont share a lot of policies
1780795 oh dont worry lubz im sure he must be gay
1780796 she lay on a torn moldy mattress on the floor she was curled on her side long legs tucked into her emaciated chest her ribs and collarbone jutted out one skinny arm was slung over her face her black hair was matted crawling with lice insect bites rashes and sores pocked her skin though she looked old enough to be in school she was naked except for a swollen diaper the authorities had discovered the rarest and most pitiable of creatures a feral child
1780797 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle
1780798 how can i be more honest accept things that dont go as planned
1780799 when you try to combat everything at the end of the day you realize that youre responsible for yourself
1780800 look at the attention i get its because i throw a football but thats what society values thats not what god values
1780801 he didnt invent the game we did i have some eye hand coordination and i can throw the ball i dont think that matters to god
1780802 the club is an asset rich cash poor golf club
1780803 the club currently has debts totalling 1 389 875 of which 623 250 is secured to westpac bank against the land and improvements
1780804 we want to move forward to bring the quality of the course up to one of queenslands best
1780805 we think its a positive thing for the club and a great chance for investment by the members
1780806 on its investment merits id be concerned about the unsecured nature of the investment and particularly the time for payment of interest
1780807 we were all under the impression the yacht was healthy
1780808 i determined from what i had seen nothing needed examining there and then
1780809 we are getting complaints from businesses bordering the cbd about vehicles that are being parked in restricted parking areas all day
1780810 we have now called for a report to look at whether we extend our areas so our staff can enforce those provisions or whether we go back to queensland police and say look we need you to enforce the regulations in the outer areas
1780811 what we need to think about is that any extension of parking zones will impact on the ability of our staff to properly be of service so we have to look carefully at what resources will be required
1780812 it is impacting particularly on the areas of hermit park west end north ward businesses are losing customers and money because cars are parked in front all day stopping other customers from finding a park
1780813 for the department to say that very vulnerable children and young people can only be taken to a centre if they have their guardian or their parents with them is ludicrous these are the very people quite often that the children and young people are escaping from
1780814 the safe havens at palm island and mornington island have been closed because of this bureaucratic stuff up and women in particular in both communities are absolutely devastated
1780815 this does not show any real understanding of indigenous communities like palm island i am horrified that this mistake has been made at a bureaucratic level
1780816 if children are being turned away in the night i want to know why and frankly i wont tolerate it
1780817 they come here to sleep and have something to eat because their parents may be drunk or fighting and they cant go home
1780818 whats so disturbing is that it was working kids were aware that the service was available
1780819 twenty four to 26 children would access the service every month
1780820 we were told by email that we needed to stop operating immediately because it was illegal to accept children unaccompanied
1780821 most of the time the children were dropped off by family members and the police dropped a couple off
1780822 we were told that we have to notify child safety or the police now if children turn up unaccompanied
1780823 where will these kids go after we were told a kid came up about 9pm all wet and hungry we organised for him to have a shower but he couldnt stay to sleep
1780824 we want to keep these kids in the community on palm the safe haven was set up for early intervention and support for families if the kids were at risk we could intervene to stop them going into the care of child safety
1780825 now all these workshops and discussions were all for nothing it was just a waste of taxpayers money
1780826 the parents decided they would withdraw their children and put them in other schools in the area
1780827 for semester two this year they actually dont have any students
1780828 with five students at the start of the year education queensland would have commenced a review process anyway but the circumstances overtook that process
1780829 it is premature to speculate on the future of the school until the consultation process has been completed
1780830 a number of factors will be taken into consideration including the capacity of the area and population demographics
1780831 if there are no new families coming in or there is no change then it the school goes through a period where there is a lull until the next generation comes through
1780832 however if youve got a strong market going on and people are buying and selling properties and families are moving in and out then there is a different response
1780833 a lot of retirees go out there and there are a lot of properties there owned by people in ingham and other areas that might just use them as holiday homes so they arent permanent
1780834 the environment and biodiversity are increasingly key themes of queenslands primary and secondary curriculum
1780835 i would certainly envisage scope for tertiary institutions such as universities other research institutions and environmentally relevant organisations to be approached as partners
1780836 theyre trying to wake him up and you can see hes trying to open his eyes but hes hitting and punching out
1780837 his partner has been up here a lot with him
1780838 when were with him we are talking to him about his daughter and all the kids nieces and nephews
1780839 he would like to go and do his own stuff but always comes back to the family
1780840 also he wants to find out more about the south sea islander part of his heritage
1780841 he was trying to help sam trying to get him off the road
1780842 he and reece have been mates ever since they were teenagers
1780843 hes a good boy very respectful to all the elders and his friends parents
1780844 while it is too early to determine if the townsville data represents a bucking of the national and state trend or a lag of it one thing is certain there are lots of good well paying job opportunities in townsville

1780988 unfortunately this kitty got neutered when it made the transition from concept to production if theres anything thats going to draw new youthful buyers to the brand its sinuous sheet metal that blends balance and bling the xf just doesnt have it the new jag floats in an air of anonymity that may cause a few people to take notice but it wont produce the neck trauma normally induced by ian callums designs
1780989 viewed from afar nothing seems to stand out the beltline is high enough to convey the sedans sporting intentions and the haunches that flow into the taillights are attractive enough in a watered down aston martin sorta way but you get the sense that the majority of the design took place a few inches from the clay rather than taking in the vehicle as a whole this approach while doing little for the xf overall has its benefits the fluting that begins aft of the headlamps and flows into the hood is a nice touch and the c pillar is almost a dead ringer for the xk but as well proportioned as everything is nothing grabs your attention by the collars and screams at you like a drunken drill instructor on leave
1780990 american equity believes it has answered all inquiries or complaints from its minnesota policyholders in a timely and satisfactory manner
1780991 american equity is unaware of any outstanding inquiry or complaint that has not been resolved
1780992 from 2000 through 2006 american equity sold approximately 46 million in long term annuities to more than 1 200 minnesotans who were over 75 years of age at the time of purchase essentially locking up their savings for up to ten to sixteen years
1780993 the maturity date of the annuities in some cases was longer than the life expectancy of the senior citizen
1780994 it was not uncommon for the insurance company to tie up over 50 of the senior citizens net worth
1780995 there is a strong and consistent message in this lawsuit and others like it minnesota will not tolerate financial abuse of our senior citizens

1781002 but as attorney general from 1999 to 2007 hatch traumatized the ags office his bare knuckled style tested the boundaries of acceptable conduct stretching across matters of law politics and especially the norms of minnesota niceness attorneys and other subordinates describe working for hatch and swanson as hellish featuring verbal abuse and pressure to do things they believed were unethical and to put hatchs political needs foremost that conclusion is based on dozens of interviews with present and former officials of the office and others who have dealt with hatch and swanson almost all of the sources requested that their names not be used as attorney general they told me hatch was a foul mouthed screamer and a bully some of the former employees described scenes of hatch yelling cursing turning red calling his subordinates names pounding his fist on a desk they said that any reluctance to unquestioningly implement an order could lead to a sudden loss of status with the management an unwanted transfer or being called into a meeting and offered a choice between resignation or dismissal
1781003 the individuals we interviewed under oath testified that the events involved in the allegations did occur the individuals said that they felt pressured to act inappropriately and they gave detailed accounts of specific events
1781004 in my 60 years i have witnessed many changes in america some have been truly good changes far too many have been downright awful changes during the past 35 years as a volunteer minnesotan i have experienced much in the way of disappointment with politicians here in the land of 10 000 lakes considering the behavior of mike hatch and lori swanson attorneys general past and present i am sad very disillusioned and downright disgusted lieing has become the new american dialect in minnesota over the course of the past three decades or so it has been turned into an astonishing art form the truth has been displaced by some foreign language and partisan spin lying a slippery communication style which should be abhorrent and an insult to us all it is a complete disgrace our elected leaders have acted to cover up the attorney general scandal the house voted 129 0 twice for an investigation and hearings with regard to ag swanson house majority leader tony sertich buried the issue in his rules committee never to see the light of day our mainstream media outlets have acted to cover up the attorney general scandal the only calls for accountability are coming form the obscure outposts of the blogosphere sadly pathetically this epidemic of dishonesty includes those whos professional obligation it is or at least used to be to give us the straight scoop relating to the day to day goings on on the home front the minnesota press corps has been almost completely non attendant on this story even they are afraid of reprisal governor tim pawlenty himself a lawyer has taken no action to remedy the broken reputation of the ags office or pursue any ethical remedies through the bar association ramsey county attorney and declared dfl gubernatorial candidate susan gaertner has done nothing to pursue this matter on tuesday june 3 2008 the mn office of the legislative auditor jim nobles issued his preliminary report relating to the non stop bizarre antics and potential lawbreaking activity of the mn attorney general lori swanson and the direct connection to former mn commerce commissioner himself the former mn ag his highness mike hatch antics and potentially illegal activity now witness corroborated activity for which any other lawyer in the street could be sanctioned and or even disbarred for exhibiting for emphasis lori swanson is the top law enforcement official in our entire minnesota legal community who clearly believes that she and her special friend and co conspirator are completely above that mundane obstacle called the law they are untouchable just ask them the ola report confirms wrongdoing the media reports it as an exoneration for swanson go figure lets dead end this thing with a go nowhere report and sweep this under the lumpy minnesota rug with all the other dirt lets lie the public will never know in fact the public may not even care any longer in a place where we have become so used to so much of the same over time and dont worry most of the press corp will just go along to get along wont they business as usual but then a gift ms ag i really do not enjoy the limelight swanson went on national television with tabloid hack chris hansen msnbcs dateline an embarrassment and dragged all minnesotans into the all humiliation network right along with her now we have her highness on video tape proclaiming for the national audience that she does not even understand the basic written materials presented to her on camera language for a brochure which was insisted upon and approved by our own minnesota department of commerce insurance division as mr hansen says to ag swanson well your a lawyer and you dont even understand this language answer no i dont is there an iq or learning disability problem here as well i received the horses laugh from friends and insurance industry colleagues from all over the country its much more than embarrassing it is an absolute shame then there is the cover up this is not simply minnesota politics folks where differing opinions are vigorously debated on the floor of our respective state houses of lawmakers it is in fact word and with conspiratorial intent nothing short of corruption at its very worst and to the core of our state government corruption so ingrained in our minnesota system of conscious active participants in it and going on for so long that we and they hardly even take notice of it any longer it is a disgrace ask yourselves the following questions folks when is the last time an actual and legitimate scandal which this matter surely is has reached the public eye and been brought into the light into public view by our mainstream media types unless there was political hay to be made by the power brokerage community standing directly behind them and guiding each and every key stroke when was the last time our mainstream media folks honestly addressed a serious public official wrongdoing which this matter surely is based upon the right vs wrong weighing of the facts and circumstances as opposed to the right vs left outcome considered first and foremost in the assessment when personally i cannot remember that far back remember as justice brandeis once said sunlight is the best disinfectant where is that guy or someone like him when you need him please allow me to point out the obvious in the wake of this pattern of behavior and slippery antics on the part of our minnesota attorney generals far too many in our press corps our legislators and others there are as a result a number of injured parties relating to their ongoing dubious and potentially lawbreaking activities the first on the list of those hurt by the actions of these individuals are the people of minnesota the folks who do most of the living working taxpaying and dying in this state they most assuredly deserve and should demand better in fact the elected folks referenced above have actually taken an oath to do the right thing in the first place not break the law to tell the truth and are expected to behave as honest public officials and represent the best interest of the public they are obliged to serve imagine that if they choose to continue with this pattern of public authority misconduct or cover it up for their own self interests they should be given the boot but good and immediately for ag lori swansons part in this waiting for her to clean up her act and that of our ag office is in my estimation a complete waste of time its too late if the testimony of the 8 former assistant attorneys general amy lawler included are to be believed per the ola report ms swanson lawyer committed the crime when she coerced these lawyers into breaking the law for her intended purposes the possibility that they did not follow her direction is in fact irrelevant and a moot point her resignation and that of those who have supported her activity should be insisted upon immediately likewise those connected to our minnesota legislature and those who conspired to engage directly in this cover up should also be forced to resign are you listening good senators and state representatives secondly there are multiple financial institutions and more to come financial professionals and private sector companies which have been subjected to career impacting business injury as a direct result of these activities and potential fraudulent manufacturing and doctoring of evidence at the behest and insistence of our out of control minnesota attorney general and her very special friend mike hatch branded as financial predators wrongly in the press is not good for business go figure additionally there may be further injury created indirectly by the co conspirators engaged in the cover up activities at the various legislative and administrative levels at our state capitol this observation is not made lightly and needs to be taken very seriously by all minnesotans now we need to ask ourselves the following question what private sector company or companies will look upon minnesota with great favor in terms of future commerce if they realize that as a matter of course continuing to conduct business in minnesota might mean having to factor into their budgets payola to the state based upon frivolous and baseless deep pocket cookie cutter lawsuits designed to create political and economic hay for guess who therefore such companies would risk suffering economically per the quasi legal extortion activity demonstrated here and instigated by our minnesota top cop and then sanctioned by our cover up artist legislators and political cronies all while our media folks look the other way the question was rhetorical of course as is the answer not many and certainly not for long have we not chased enough private sector businesses out of minnesota yet to say nothing of the fact that this is just flat out wrong and illegal it is essential that we do deal with the truth today or it will deal with us eventually remember the old purolator oil

1781082 finally all the favre fans can go litter the tampa or new york message boards with their idiotic comments and us true packer fans can talk about the team no disrespect to favre i love him miss him already and think that manangement did a poor job of handling the situation all that being said im a packer fan and will root for the 53 guys on this team through thick and thin
1781083 jesus was never traded so why would you trade favre
1781084 please un retire randy wright you are nuts to think brett was the only reason we were 13 3 do you know anything
1781085 but we didnt theres something missing in our team right now
1781086 i cant believe how the front office has f ked up this thing he is one of the two or three best all time players in franchise history you cant treat him like a piece of dirt i would bet that this is going to end up costing a few people their jobs next january
1781087 new scenario the trades do not work out and bf feels it is best to stay retired 1st quarter of the opening game ar gets injured 2nd quarter tt and mm are on a plane down to mississipi to tell bf how much they need him and will he come back bf comes back to town takes the team to the superbowl and tt and mm are ousted bf retires and all live happily every after
1781088 i sure hope you tt bashers are willing to re cant if they do indeed make the playoffs
1781089 the packers were under great leadership util you came along ted
1781090 lets fix this then and give rodgers 4 everyone cool with that
1781091 do people seriously think that brett single handedly won all those games last year
1781092 please un retire randy wright you are nuts to think brett was the only reason we were 13 3 do you know anything
1781093 what will all you tt mm and mm bashers say when the pack wins the div and gets a 1st round bye
1781094 oh and you people that claim to be shareholders and act like it matters at all are really precious
1781095 as a final note i am sure that other players are watching this debacle and realizing that green bay is not a place that wants to win anymore that cant be good for the future it is a sad day for the packer nation
1781096 i bet they blame it all on favre when it goes south for them
1781097 but that said this whole ordeal has been handled so poorly by the packers choosing to not give bf a release earlier on and not being clear with him that they would trade him either or refusing to trade him within the division

1781109 youre right about weeks and he also has only screwed up running the bases three times and and made only two crucial errors at 2nd
1781110 you have to wonder if ray durham had been giving hitting advice to rickie
1781111 and when ichiro shows up im all for putting him in the leadoff spot
1781112 thankfully ned yost pay any attention to the nonsense written no these blogs
1781113 now my question there would be why counsell couldnt do it but whatever works

1781201 before the new wave before godard and truffaut and chabrol before belmondo flicked the cigarette into his mouth in one smooth motion and walked the streets of paris like a hollywood gangster there was bob
1781202 the plot mainly provides excuses for melville to indulge his tastes for amazingly delicate nocturnal imagery smoky atmospherics mechanical gimmickry and attractive young women melville is able to cast a spell of fairy tale unreality around his characters
1781203 the biggest revelation of the series it rains all the time and the sense of hopeless social determinism is both poetic and oppressive madeleine robinson gives a naturalistic singularly modern performance mark your calendar

1781205 shows fine craftsmanship and is beautifully sensitive to place and atmosphere

1781215 the nimble crime of the title perfected by a fiercely philosophical outlaw is itself a work of art and bresson reveals it in all of its varieties as a furtive street ballet
1781216 bressons parable of crime and redemption is timeless achieving a state of spiritual grace rarely seen or even contemplated in the secular medium of cinema
1781217 dont miss bressons terse classic plays out like a russian novel stripped of all pretensions a rigorous look at one mans journey becomes a liberating experience for all
1781218 elliptical economical an experience that never loses its strangeness to not get bresson is to not get the idea of motion pictures
1781219 by pushing through the authentic details into a more transcendental realm bresson in fact subtly transforms the simple story into a metaphysical meditation the kind of film which inspires awe even in an atheist
1781220 the best of all prison escape movies the greatest achievement of robert bresson one of the cinemas foremost artists essential viewing
1781221 bresson is to french cinema what mozart is to german music and dostoevsky is to russian literature

1781223 never has the famous gallic siren been so frankly and ferociously employed as a symbol of sexual intemperance and rebellion as bardot is in
1781224 may be the quintessential godard picture part road movie part improvisational exercise part genre deconstruction

1781226 like visiting another planet its an explosion of color sound music passion violence and wit that illustrates what used to be regarded as cinema
1781227 irish aka cornell woolrich adaptation and his biggest budgeted work to date approx 123 min
1781228 a go for broke romantic melodrama so full of lovely complex things of unannounced emotions of ideas of the memories of other movies truffauts as well as those of two of his father figures renoir and hitchcock it is the creation of a superior moviemaker who works eccentrically in the classical tradition even the opening title credits are haunting
1781229 bewitching and lavish deneuve and belmondo at their most dazzling
1781230 for fans of classic hard boiled crime cinema nothing will compete with le doulos the great jean pierre melvilles most influential film a masterful blend of economy and style
1781231 arguably melvilles best film so stylized that its nearly a fetish vehicle for staccato dialogue trench coats and fedoras
1781232 the kind of movie that makes you want to throw on your trench coat light up a cigarette and shoot somebody a tough and touching exploration of honor and friendship among thieves a masterpiece of the french gangster genre
1781233 sautet is patient psychologically exact and firmly in control of the narrative rhythm yet the film never feels artificial or overconstructed
1781234 a stunning gangster flick that expertly balances terse macho theatrics and a surprisingly tender emotional throughline
1781235 you couldnt ask for a more humanistic example of genre storytelling those who love euro stars should consider it required viewing venturas mug has never been more suited for a part and belmondo radiates a supernova charisma whenever the two actors share the screen it suddenly turns into the most hard boiled buddy movie youve ever seen
1781236 taverniers rowdy broad unsettling moral tale follows screwball comedy out to its other side as madness youre never sure whether what youre watching is high spirits or insanity and the characters keep reversing themselves tavernier created one of the freshest french films in years it has wit dash and fiber
1781237 the chilling amoral landscapes in jim thompsons pop 1280 come to life ingeniously transposing the u s south to a french colony in africa
1781238 very moving taverniers initial effort is a work of assurance and ease it is both complex and simple in the way of a film that knows exactly what its about which is fathers and sons and the respect that is possible between them under even the worst of circumstances
1781239 tavernier invests the film with details from the personal and domestic to the widely cultural and political observations this perspective combines with noirets humbly intelligent performance to strip the film even in its tenderest moments of melodrama
1781240 a fine psychological thriller millers confidence in dialogue and an ever more tightly twisting plot is simply a gripping joy
1781241 this tightly paced drama provides a fine showcase for ventura and serrault the neatly constructed script emphasizes the psychological struggle between the characters and like the much lauded tv series diabolique 1955 henri georges clouzot downtrodden wife vera clouzot and no nonsense mistress simone signoret team up to eliminate their perfect salaud husband lover and then la terreur commence dizzying plot twists lead to an eyeball glazing d nouement in clouzots suspense masterpiece scripters pierre boileau and thomas narcejac wrote the novel basis for hitchcocks vertigo approx 114 min 1 30 5 25 9 50 psycho did for showers
1781242 excruciatingly nerve wrecking could serve as a primer for todays would be horror meisters
1781243 beneath the surface of clouzots elegantly perverse thriller lie bottomless reserves of malice and kinky intrigue the very sight of the victims dainty wife and his tough steely mistress is enough to suggest all manner of forbidden possibilities
1781244 a primer for a generation of thrill filmmakers clouzot is an uncompromising master of suspense
1781245 brilliant no matter how many times youve seen it diabolique still has one of the all time great endings
1781246 i sought only to amuse myself and the little child who sleeps in all our hearts
1781247 exquisite dread images a vague floating almost lyric sense of horror
1781248 a masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful tactile brutality the look is black on black with gleaming highlights the musical accompaniment is gleefully carnivalesque its one of the three movies along with psycho and peeping tom that created the modern slasher shocker
1781249 haunting gorgeous intensely disquieting black and white images the unearthly beauty of franjus imagery is never merely decorative but is the real substance of his terrible gentle poetic art franju shocks us by embracing and then transcending the grotesque
1781250 a dream of a movie a disturbing kaleidoscope of charged imagery and devilish suspense
1781251 eyes without a face is austere and elegant the exquisite photography is by the great shuftan the music by maurice jarre the gowns by givenchy it is in some peculiar way a classic of horror
1781252 the three consummate cinema actors are excellent together highlights include the spectacularly shot forced landing of an airplane on a motorway and delon viciously battering a live eel to death on the rocks watched by his shaken but excited lover
1781253 the cold restraint with which melville films the opening bank robbery and the central heist suggests emotion with an exquisite subtlety that borders on hysterical repression and delon with his ice blue eyes and mask like stillness serves the directors purposes perfectly as does catherine deneuve as a platinum princess melvilles chilly manner turns sardonic as he vents pent up bile
1781254 memorable for the 24 year old malles stunning imagination and control and perhaps even more so for jeanne moreaus slightly worn extraordinary face that mouth those eyes
1781255 delectable stuffed with many sumptuous sights and sounds gorgeous nighttime shots of paris lensed by henri deca miles daviss largely improvised score the nail biting breakout from the titular lift and jeanne moreau here in the role that would make her a star
1781256 a consummate entertainment rich with the romantic atmosphere of paris in the 1950s has the brisk craftsmanship and efficiency of classic french cinema and a breathless hint of the energy of the new wave that was but a few years away
1781257 malles snazzy debut feature a consistently engaging atmospheric noir an ideal showcase for moreaus natural beauty
1781258 in his full eccentric glory grunting cryptic responses to grandiose questions
1781259 dispensing with virtually every cinematic convention in the book this dynamic debut served as both an ostentatious calling card for frances burgeoning nouvelle vague and a much needed wake up call to a medium that had grown dangerously stodgy a free wheeling masterpiece
1781260 godards brilliant provocation a progenitor of the youth cult film breathless still plays beautifully it lighted the fuse for the whole youth movement in cinema some of todays young directors may not even know how indebted they are to godards work the fact remains that breathless is where it they all began
1781261 viewing this landmark flick on a tiny screen in my living room would be akin to eating a gourmet french meal on the times square shuttle breathless needs the proper surroundings in godards case a bigger than life screen and the ambiance of a dark theater see you at film forum
1781262 no film has been at once so connected to all that had come before it and yet so liberating like a high energy fusion of jazz and philosophy
1781263 all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun
1781264 godards idea of a heist picture is like nothing that had ever been seen before its a strange unceasingly inventive pastiche and one of his best
1781265 a reverie of a gangster movie godard re creates the gangsters and the moll as people in a paris caf mixing them with rimbaud kafka alice in wonderland this lyrical tragicomedy is perhaps godards most delicately charming film
1781266 godard at his most off the cuff takes a s rie noire and spins a fast and loose tale one of his most open and enjoyable films
1781267 about the tyranny of living a life of movie fed fantasies and while it makes us see the poverty of those fantasies it also makes them unaccountably rich poetic sad
1781268 so intensely ripely physical that she takes command of the screen
1781269 rarely in cinema has the sweet transience of erotic passion been more vividly evoked
1781270 primarily a film of personalities but also a visual tour de force at times funny at times tragic proves that we can surpass parody we can look at the picturesque and bloody past and evoke it with tenderness and violence
1781271 one of the great movie romances this elegant masterwork is a glowingly nostalgic evocation of the paris of the impressionists focusing on the apache underworld and an ill starred romance with an elusive density a probing awareness of emotional complexities signoret as voluptuously sensual as a rubens painting has never been more stunning and she is perfectly partnered by reggiani seemingly carved out of mahogany yet revealing an ineffable grace in movement
1781272 a world of cutthroats apaches and gun molls subtly evoking an atmosphere that gives meaning and passion and an overdose of doom to their rivalries and intrigues
1781273 an insular underworld drama of love and revenge vibrates authentically against a vividly etched background of early century paris beckers commendable camera scours the skyline the smoke filled bistros the tarnished hotel rooms and the cobblestone byways with the eye of a painter
1781274 decidedly weird rural france is packed with petty liars and sneaky cheats
1781275 beckers first really great film less concerned with the suspense of the novel than with its down to earth study of peasant behavior becker follows the fine tradition of his master jean renoir
1781276 uncovers entire worlds to view layered and profuse quai des orf vres which accepts and embraces the world while pretending to sneer at it is as rich and deep and wily and teeming as a 400 page classic novel and it demands to be seen again and again
1781277 a gorgeous extremely noir thriller as atmospheric as they come
1781278 two stellar star turns suzy delair as the gleefully exuberantly vulgar music hall singer and simone renant as the glacially elegant photographer suggests an undercurrent of eroticism thats as powerful as it is suppressed noir cest noir indeed
1781279 few crime movies are as spectacular as this the black and white chiaroscuro seduces and glistens filmed in such a dazzling way you wonder where the magic went in our contemporary banal movie fictions
1781280 before casablanca there was p p one of the most exciting and moving films i can remember seeing raises the thriller to a poetic level
1781281 the criminal as raffish irresistible satyr is perhaps most memorably embodied by jean gabin in duviviers p p le moko
1781282 superb entertainment one of the most compelling of all the fatalistic french screen romances
1781283 seldom have the exquisite pain and pleasure of motion picture suspense been mixed with quite its intoxicating effects
1781284 this grueling pile driver of a movie will keep you on the edge of your seat
1781285 an existential thriller the most original and shocking french melodrama of the 1950s it is clouzots most powerful film the violence is not simply used for used as in eisensteins and bunuels films to force a vision of human experience
1781286 the extended suspense sequences deserve a place among the great stretches of cinema

1781633 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
1781634 we have first commitments across the globe and threats and contingencies we need to be situated for beyond just the wars in iraq and afghanistan
1781635 retiree fees ought to relate to how much the plan is worth
1781636 the higher value plans should have higher premiums associated with them
1781637 they ought to reflect how much income an individual has so that if they make more money and are therefore better able to pay for a system they should do so
1781638 when tricare started out in 1995 military members retirees were charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1781639 today in 2008 theyre charged 230 per individual 460 per family
1781640 essentially what this says to you is that we are asking our older retirees who are in fact the least likely to hold jobs and therefore have the lowest incomes to pay the most for their system
1781641 we believe we need to get some parity between our older and our younger retirees
1781642 we believe that the under 65 retirees should begin paying 40 percent of the medicare part b premium using the same fee structure that is laid on by the medicare system
1781643 in addition we believe that the under 65 retirees who elect to use tricare standard and extra need to pay a small fee for that
1781644 and we would suggest to the department that that fee be set at 15 percent of the medicare part b we think the family rate should be set at double the individual rate and that the premium increase needs to be phased in over four years
1781645 there is a perception that the system we have today is inequitable because only 15 percent of all enlisted personnel and less than half of officers will ever receive anything in the system
1781646 this is a payment made for achieving a particular year of service
1781647 and within the services they would have the flexibility to vary this by year of service as well as by skill that way they could begin to shape the skills by dragging people further into their career by offering them an incentive
1781648 the separation payments would be made available by the service to members that they wished to entice to leave
1781649 therefore the recommendation of this qrmc is that the department of defense conduct a multi year test of this system
1781650 the way the test would work is this all four services would be asked to identify some skills that have different types of retention patterns some that stay not very long some that stay longer periods of time and ones they wish to influence
1781651 if someone was selected for the test they would be paid all of the tsp that they should have earned up until that point and it will be put in their tsp account for them
1781652 the programs vesting rules would in fact apply to all those individuals so should they achieve 10 years of service while they are in the test they would fully own it
1781653 i tried at 18 but because of family values and respect for my family i chose not to
1781654 i still knew that if someday it came around that i could do it
1781655 i was always hoping and praying somehow id make this goal this dream happen
1781656 i was called grandma and old lady most of the time i was there
1781657 he said you cant be coming here i said yes i am
1781658 you cant let that happen i cant have my mom here
1781659 i wanted to try and accomplish the rest of my goal which was to come to the service and to serve the soldiers i knew what the soldiers had to go through i saw my sons go through it and i wanted to be here to be of service to them
1781660 all the way through basic training they kept emphasizing that we were going to be deployed i was wholeheartedly engaged with the fact that i was going to serve my country one way or the other
1781661 whatever my country expected of me thats what i was going to do
1781662 i wasnt looking for anybody to be my significant other when i got to fort stewart
1781663 he came over to me in the foxhole and said what are you shooting at
1781664 he said from the first day he met me youre going to marry me he was telling everybody
1781665 ive always felt that when soldiers accept me as working hard and getting them where they need to be helping them accomplish their mission that is my reward
1781666 he said that since he was retiring i would be retiring too
1781667 for anybody over 40 who really wants to come to the service there is a very big reward here
1781668 you have to come here open minded you cant come here as your own individual you have to be willing to change and you have to be willing to serve
1781669 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1781670 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1781671 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1781672 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1781673 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1781674 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1781675 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1781676 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1781677 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1781678 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity
1781679 para efectos del poder electoral seguimos en la misma situaci n los que fueron sancionados e inhabilitados por el art culo 105 por el rgano competente para el cuerpo rectoral que era el contralor efectivamente siguen inhabilitados y no podr n ser postulados a menos que saliera la sentencia interpretaci n diciendo lo contrario o si los recursos particulares salieran antes del 12 de agosto
1781680 para excluirlos de aquellos que tienen el c digo respectivo dentro de la base del poder electoral
1781681 es un avance m s por ahora solamente quedar a a manera general el recurso de interpretaci n o los recursos particulares que lleva la sala pol tico administrativa
1781682 primero deben llenar la planilla y luego presentar los recaudos ante la junta regional correspondiente
1781683 el gobierno tiene miedo y s lo le queda la fuerza para imponerse
1781684 no ser arist bulo ist riz sino el de la unidad
1781685 el presidente de la rep blica no est pensando en leyes para mejorar la calidad de los venezolanos sino que por el contrario busca son sus intereses personales
1781686 todo recordamos como llam el presidente en diciembre la victoria del pueblo venezolano en el referendo constitucional hoy con este madrugonazo de las 26 leyes habilitantes confirmamos que eso que dijo en diciembre es lo que realmente significa para el primer mandatario la voluntad del pueblo y la decisi n que tomamos en diciembre y los m s ins lito de todo esto es la improvisaci n y en particular la miserable actuaci n de la asamblea nacional
1781687 resulta muy clara las intenciones del jefe de estado de meternos a los venezolanos un socialismo intravenoso que no tiene ning n fundamento concreto m s all de lograr ejercer m s poder sobre el pueblo venezolano
1781688 resulta muy claro el nfasis en querer controlar absolutamente todo lo que hacemos los venezolanos uno de los temas de la reforma que fueron rechazados por los venezolanos es lo relacionado con la propiedad privada sin embargo vemos como el gobierno insiste en la posibilidad de expropiar todo cuanto le venga en gana y cuando le provoque sin duda alguna que lo denunciado en la propaganda de la carnicer a una vez m s se reafirma cuando ahora se encuentra vigente en la ley para la defensa de las personas en el acceso de bienes y servicios en su art culo 5
1781689 venimos de la zona de barlovento estamos presentes con un hombre que trabaja las 24 horas por los mirandinos mendoza garantiza el triunfo para recuperar nuestro estado l nos ha dado la mano en los momentos dif ciles y queremos que vuelva a la gobernaci n

1781708 im digging back into the archives a bit because with all the talk lately of hydrogen powered vehicles its really funny to remember that jack nicholson had one in 1978 back then the oil embargo was an even more giant inconvenience than todays high prices you actually had to wait in line for the stuff and even then only if your license plate ended in an odd or even number depending on the day leave it to jack nicholson to pull up in a modified chevy running on hydrogen to prove to everyone how possible it was not to depend on oil companies for energy even more surreal the hydrogen was created using electricity supplied by solar panels all this from over thirty years ago
1781709 hey america i am paris hilton and i am a celebrity too only i am not from the olden days and i am not promising change like that other guy i am just hot but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means i am running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want americans to know that i am like totally ready to lead
1781710 mccains campaign reportedly is spending 140 000 a day to run his ad in battleground states
1781711 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1781712 because hilton implies she has a sophisticated knowledge of an important geopolitical issue lol
1781713 she has every right to bitch slap grampy but they sic oil companies already have limited off shore drilling rights which they are not utilizing now they want access to the restricted areas which they would utilize apparently so that americans would develop a placebo effect sense that the oil crisis was improving
1781714 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1781715 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1781716 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1781717 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1781718 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1781719 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1781720 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1781721 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1781722 pragmatically we just cant get the system to work in a timely manner for us to implement payment of minimum wage
1781723 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape
1781724 why have the worlds most famous transsexual representing a line of our cosmetics why not amandas beauty goes way past gender she is one of the most glamorous personalities in the art fashion and gay worlds anyone with as much influence in those worlds is just an obvious choice for us
1781725 we dont say grandma we say nona it means grandma in italian
1781726 it all undermines the family the bedrock of our society
1781727 we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with
1781728 poor george he was born with a silver foot in his mouth
1781729 lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i will make three dwellings here one for you one for moses and one for elijah
1781730 so you are telling me that i have to pay for 19 years of something the city overlooked
1781731 we were fortunate to spend all of february in evaristo perez all aspects greatly exceeded our expectations the property was much more spacious than we thought from the web site and absolutely everything we could want had been provided the welcome basket was especially appreciated after a long journey fran and mike our hosts were very special people and always available to ensure that we got the most from the very friendly village and the amazing range of entrancing walks many thanks to them we would love to return at some stage
1781732 my husband and i had a wonderful stay at evaristo perez the property was spacious and very clean with everything you could want provided our hosts mike and fran were very helpful and friendly and we could not have asked for better accommodation we would highly recommend this property for staying in real spain
1781733 en venezuela existe un orden legal y constitucional el cual debemos todos respetar
1781734 he dicho que no tiene ning n sentido el que contin en amenaz ndome o insult ndome con eso no van a lograr que las decisiones se modifiquen
1781735 estas decisiones est n sujetas al marco constitucional y al marco legal
1781736 yo entiendo que hay los reclamos y los planteamientos a los cuales tiene derecho cualquier persona sobretodo en venezuela que hay libertades plenas para ejercer los derechos civiles y pol ticos pero ellos los inhabilitados ten an que haber demostrado en la contralor a que eran inocentes y eso no lo hicieron nunca
1781737 efectivamente los hallazgos que la contralor a de la rep blica ten a o que nos hab an remitido desde las dem s contralor as eran lo suficientemente consistentes como para no haber sido desvirtuados por ellos cuando ejercieron el derecho a la defensa
1781738 for me any understanding of the contemporary world is mediated by the reading of matthew 24 the most important part is the sentence where the corpse lies the vultures shall gather because it seems to be a decomposition of the mimetic mechanism the mechanism is visible but it doesnt work any great christian experience is apocalyptic because what one realizes is that after the decomposition of the sacrificial order there is nothing standing between ourselves and our possible destruction how this will materialize i dont really know
1781739 the ideology that attempts to outchristianize christianity that imitates christianity in a spirit of rivalry you can foresee the shape of what the anti christ is going to be in the future
1781740 ideologies are not violent per se rather it is man who is violent ideologies provide the grand narrative which covers up our victimary tendency they are mythical happy endings to our histories of persecution the cross has destroyed one and for all the cathartic power of the scapegoat mechanism consequently the gospel does not provide a happy ending to our history it simply shows us two options either we imitate christ giving up all our mimetic violence or we run the risk of self destruction the apocalyptic feeling is based on that risk
1781741 t he more there is an opening in the world where ritual is dead the more dangerous this world becomes it has both positive aspects in the sense that there is less sacrifice and negative aspects in that there is an unleashing of mimetic rivalry as i said we live in a world where we take care of victims in a way no other society or historical time ever did but we are also in a world that kills more people than ever so we have the feeling that both the good and the bad are increasing all the time if we have a theory of culture it has to account for this extraordinary ambivalence of our society
1781742 because the victimary principle of the defence of the victims has become holy
1781743 earlier in chapter 6 girard has briefly made a distinction between sacred god of violence and holy god of non violence which im not sure obtains here i dont read it to obtain
1781744 man has a tendency to relapse into the sacred prompting violence to defend any idea of principle seen simply as sacred
1781745 the compassion for the victim is the deeper meaning of christianity we will always be mimetic but we do not have to engage automatically in mimetic rivalries
1781746 regarding the emergence of the modern individual i would say that it is important not to completely dismiss this as being exclusively an illusion of mimetic desire this is a very important point undoubtedly there is a real individual this is the one who goes against the crowd for reasons that arent rooted in the negative aspects of mimetic desire the christian individual contradicts the crowd he or she doesnt join the multitude in the scapegoat resolution of the mimetic crisis and moreover denounces the very scapegoat mechanism as a murder through the declaration of the innocence of the victim
1781747 in other words it is to do with fashion no one is conventional today everybody wants to be more original than the next person the only way modernity can be defined is the universalization of internal mediation i e desire that is influenced or created by peers for one doesnt have areas of life that would keep people apart from each other and that would mean that the construction of our beliefs and identity cannot but have strong mimetic components
1781748 this mimetic competition produces high doses of resentment that might be socially stored and could become harmful at some point
1781749 it also increases the power and possible harmful actions of aggression and violence
1781750 econometrics is the calculation of the tolerable number of sacrifices in a given market could we say that economy and market are founded on the principles of exclusion
1781751 for me globalization is mainly the abolition not only of sacrifice properly speaking but also of the entire sacrificial order it is the encompassing spread of christian ethics and epistemology in relation to every sphere of human activity
1781752 i am not claiming that our world is not unstable and above all i am not saying at all that ours is an ideal world i think it is a very fragile one and still very unjust but it has elements of stability that replace the external mediation once provided by the sacred order
1781753 the market appears as a system which produces a tolerable amount of victims
1781754 it also saves more victims than any previous historical movement ever did one cannot balance these accounts and balance them against what we do not have a clear model to compare with it is the first time in world history that a society cannot be compared with any other since ours is the first to encompass the whole planet
1781755 i dont think we can fully equate the victims of a system as complex as the global market with the deliberate slaughtering of a human being by other human beings involved in sacrificial rituals the market is not a technical apparatus devised to kill people
1781756 the kathecon containing nature of these systems still relies on false transcendence and they are inevitably bound to produce injustice and violence but we live in a world where the satanic power of the mimetic mechanism is unleashed so we have to take into account that this system is also protecting us albeit temporarily from the explosion of even greater violence i am not an advocate of globalization or the so called new international order i am just trying to see the complexity of the contemporary situation without reducing it either to an irresponsible celebration or to a complete condemnation
1781757 in our society religion has been completely subsumed by economics but precisely because economics springs from a religious matrix it is nothing but the secularized form of religious ritual
1781758 trade was really an offering to the foreigner in order to placate the foriegn god who was seen as a possible threat even etymologically the word money is related to the goddess juno moneta and her temple in whose proximity coins were minted
1781759 which uses mimetic mechanisms constantly and depicts its characters as puppets of mimetic desire
1781760 they recognize something that is very common and very true but they cannot define it
1781761 contemporary democray is dominated by conformism which is produced by the passion for equality and which engenders apathy and indifference instead of conflict
1781762 contemporary individuals arent strong enough to have mimetic desire they arent passionate about anything
1781763 consumption society which was invented partially to cope with mimetic aggressive behaviour has eventually created these socially indifferent human beings unable to communicate with each other and mainly concerned with what is strictly accountable in their life in the sense of self interest this is a radical form of nihilism
1781764 the notion of gift as everybody knows is extremely ambiguous because of the reciprocity it implies any form of mimetic reciprocity may trigger negative effects the paroxysm of gift giving is clear in the phenomenon of the potlatch as described by marcel mauss which is nothing but a ritualized form of mimetic rivalry on a social scale what is important is not the object that you offer but the humiliation that you want to inflict on the rival tribe i think we should move towards an ethics of generosity but going beyond the notion of gift a good relationship cannot be anything but reciprocal this reciprocity should be spontaneous if there is an obligation it means that we are approaching bad reciprocity
1781765 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1781766 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
1781767 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1781768 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1781769 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
1781770 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
1781771 m s grande del que se tuvo en a os anteriores
1781772 dejando por sentado que del art culo 105 de la ley org nica de la contralor a general de la rep blica y del sistema de control fiscal no es contrario a constituci n
1781773 its an interesting situation when you play a team like jacksonville in their home facility
1781774 the girls played tough a couple of days earlier at florida state who ended up being ranked in the top 10 during the season we knew that we had a strong team but i thought the jacksonville match was a big opportunity for us to prove that
1781775 it was really exciting to see things come together for the first time in 2008 during the jacksonville match
1781776 with varsha shiva shankar nicked up at no 3 doubles and no 6 singles we were essentially playing with two doubles teams and five singles players julie tiffany rebecca and emily took control of their matches and got the job done
1781777 based on information that is of sufficient reliability that can properly be considered under the guideline provisions
1781778 announced its findings as to the amount of tax loss a critical sentencing determination before schroeders attorney had an opportunity to comment on the issue
1781779 the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy
1781780 that the fact finder believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than the non existence of that fact
1781781 that the government had met its burden of proof merely by submitting admissible evidence
1781782 as frauds attributable to schroeder without conducting any analysis as to what evidence proved that schroeders unlawful conduct caused the underpayments
1781783 im only going to eat half of one theyre so rich

1781785 we chose to accept a calculated risk with something that would have an effect at the beginning of the hurricane season
1781786 we know why that occurred were making fixes to that
1781787 they were accomplished in time for the beginning of the 2006 hurricane season on a schedule of unprecedented speed and scope
1781788 i do know that a great deal of technical expertise and scrutiny has been given to this
1781789 in general the repairs have strengthened the levees enough to prevent another catastrophic breach but havent yet raised them enough to prevent overtopping in places
1781790 we eventually will have a levee thats 15 or 16 feet high
1781791 the whole mr go levee is made up of material thats shown to be eroding even from the rain
1781792 if another katrina hit waves will chew up the levees again and youll have more catastrophic flooding
1781793 if theres another katrina both sides of that system would be overtopped and you would see flooding he said
1781794 bea also found that decade old gaps remain in the floodwalls lining the orleans avenue canal and hurricane damaged sections of the walls along the london avenue and 17th street canals have not been repaired or replaced
1781795 the great flood of 1927 hurricane betsy 1960s hurricane katrina 2005 then new orleans is at least 30 or 40 years away from the next major strike
1781796 the corps doesnt get all the blame living below sea level is the first problem
1781797 rather than move the pump stations as they should have at local expense they made the corps build walls back to the pump stations at federal expense
1781798 at that time i guess in terms of education i was at coastal 101
1781799 what im here for this time is coastal 201 but im working on my phd
1781800 its going to take a long time but im getting there
1781801 to enable the corps and the nation to fully understand the long history of federal state and local decisions that led to the design and construction of the new orleans area flood and storm damage reduction system
1781802 theres such great promise and hope for this city to get back on its feet and even be greater than it ever was
1781803 there are going to be a couple of features that probably as we get towards that date were going to do interim measures
1781804 but we plan to protect this city to the 100 year level by 2011 or were going to break our backs trying to get there
1781805 and if we tell you that were not going to make the deadline its going to be because there are hard facts that were beyond our control
1781806 if its done thoughtfully professionally and it stays within the time limits we want to get the project done
1781807 in st bernard parish the levees are at 20 feet now
1781808 so that gives them the ability to withstand a lot more than they could pre katrina because some of those levees were in the maybe 12 to 16 feet range
1781809 corps does not agree with any assertion that usace is solely responsible for the events of hurricane katrina
1781810 civil works projects are all authorized by congress and planned designed and constructed cooperatively between local state and federal agencies
1781811 the most severe meteorological conditions considered reasonably characteristic for that region
1781812 the bush administration has been asking us to discriminate against storm victims since day one
1781813 we rejected it then and we reject it today these are american citizens were talking about and theyve been out of their homes for almost two years now enough is enough
1781814 the money was supposed to go to places that were flooded like the lower ninth gentilly and lakeview but its going elsewhere
1781815 we agreed to one thing and we come back and they are running a program that we said federal taxpayers were not going to fund
1781816 everyone knows another big storm would tear that sucker up
1781817 i believe we should order the corps to achieve category 5 protection over time
1781818 just looking at the place its clear that theres tremendous damage
1781819 theres a laundry list of things where its easy to figure out theyre not eligible for any money
1781820 will the design have to be looked at very closely yes
1781821 at the same time im not going to suggest that those who have fought long and hard for morganza to the gulf that were taking it out of the plan thats just not going to happen
1781822 and what happens when you come back and say its not going to be like that now youve got people pushing against the best location of these features because thats what you promised them
1781823 adaptive management works when youre planting a field with two different types of crops and you decide one works better
1781824 but does anyone really believe that after spending billions of dollars and building miles of these levees the corps is going to say hey this isnt working like we thought lets change this
1781825 if you want to be charitable you can say theyve been in a hurry to get something out
1781826 as americans we can always find a way to solve our problems and get what we want
1781827 some appliances did not work workers began to get electric shocks then a burning smell enveloped the kitchen as the wiring began to melt
1781828 and that were not all crazy for living below sea level in the bayou
1781829 but well be just one project on a long list of budget priorities and theres no funding guarantees
1781830 move beyond sound bites and armchair theories to make the nation safer
1781831 was the cause of the widespread flooding and damage in new orleans
1781832 much of the destruction was the result of engineering and engineering related policy failures

1781842 philosophy has not trusted emotion and has largely relegated it to the dismissible realms of animal and flesh for a time science fared better but then it too missed its opportunity
1781843 darwins work on the emotions vanished from site jamess proposal was attacked unfairly and dismissed summarily and freuds influence went elsewhere throughout most of the twentieth century emotion was not trusted in the laboratory
1781844 were trading in west hollywood for west texas and big disposable incomes for disposable diapers
1781845 most important were integrating without abandoning our community or sense of identity these developments are good for lgbt people and good for america
1781846 we are pleased that the nih has again recognized the potential of our revolutionary nanoscale single molecule imaging and analysis technology by awarding us this new grant which is explicitly intended to support the development of a platform to produce consistent linearization and imaging of individual dna molecules allowing for high resolution mapping of labeled genomic sites
1781847 this added support will help us accelerate the development of the platform which we believe could add significantly to the understanding of genetic diseases by increasing access to whole genome analysis and by allowing researchers to view and analyze the critical haplotype information that is currently difficult to obtain

1781853 reducing the number of smokers with a price rise is nonsense smokers will switch to cheaper brands
1781854 this is insulting to us women and it harms the countrys image since were increasingly becoming a country of destination for tourists whose sole purpose is to have sex with our women
1781855 we take this issue very seriously we are pushing for legislation to forbid sex tourists from entering the country we are sick of men looking at us like pieces of meat
1781856 ukraine has a competitive advantage simply put our women are the best in the world
1781857 what ukraine needs to do to improve its image tainted by corruption sex tourism and other problems is to conduct a positive image campaign with systemic consistent and coordinated support from the top
1781858 theres a definite correlation between the new visa free regime and visitors to my club as is true in other places in kyiv such as arena and avalon
1781859 the growing amount of sex tourists entering ukraine has not escaped us but it is very difficult to measure their numbers
1781860 most women i spoke with are ashamed and do this out of poverty but some also do it out of material desire
1781861 they see luxury cars and houses and they want it now so they either compete for sugar daddies or willingly sell themselves
1781862 the girls here are tall and slim and getting them into bed is easy moreover they are fun to party with
1781863 morals are not instilled at the state operated orphanages when i speak to the older girls at these institutions all they talk about are cigarettes cars and so on without realizing how much they cost or how much they have to work to purchase them

1781880 occasionally when im running ill come to a long downhill and my legs work the way they used to work and my arm swings the way it used to its like running before parkinsons and thats the best feeling

1781893 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
1781894 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
1781895 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
1781896 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
1781897 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems
1781898 despite operating in accordance with industry guidelines the company has taken a decision to no longer publish adult services advertisements either in print or on its websites
1781899 increasing concerns regarding the appalling issue of human trafficking has been significant in this decision which is effective immediately
1781900 the croydon community against trafficking has been campaigning passionately to reduce the demand for trafficked women in croydon and neighbouring boroughs for almost three years
1781901 a big focus has always been the role of the media such as newspapers in cutting off demand to reduce supply of the women who are being enslaved in our town
1781902 after thousands of letters and the shouts of a loud and concerned community newsquest and their local papers have responded in a brilliant way
1781903 we are pleased that newsquest have had the boldness to lead in an industry that has historically been complicit in the trafficking of women by allowing these victims to be sold via adult adverts in their family publications
1781904 we hope that the other newspapers in our borough which have otherwise entirely ignored their readers calls for justice will follow the example now set by newsquest and the local newspapers it publishes
1781905 stop the traffik welcomes this stance newsquest has taken in recognising the potential within the sex industry for the exploitation of trafficked people
1781906 we hope this encourages local authorities businesses and enforcement agencies to work together within their communities to stop the trafficking
1781907 we are thrilled at newsquests decision to pull adverts for adult services in their publications
1781908 the link between these adverts and the supply of trafficked women to meet these demands has been well documented and we would like to see other publications now following this example
1781909 this issue is not one that can or should be brushed under the carpet and we hope that this bold step by newsquest will raise awareness of the issue and the importance of taking action on behalf of those who are voiceless
1781910 there are very few breakthrough innovations in the market today addressing these industry wide thermal issues
1781911 nextreme is managed by an accomplished start up team and offers a highly differentiated technology backed by a very strong intellectual property position
1781912 we are very pleased with where we are now positioned
1781913 we are seeing strong interest in the optocooler upf4 and upf40 products and anticipate design wins in the telecom industry this year with financing in place and production up and running we can concentrate fully on making that happen
1781914 customer adoption is always a risk for a new product
1781915 enabling it to be incorporated into existing designs with as little change as possible is a good strategy for getting through the customers front door and inspiring further redesigns later on companies that have bumped up against performance limitations due to thermal management issues should engage with nextreme to find a possible way to sidestep these issues
1781916 we are proud that awi has noted smartsilver as one of the best choices for protecting wool fabrics
1781917 our nanoscale silver antimicrobial products are engineered to integrate seamlessly into the manufacturing process resulting in beautiful natural wool fabrics that are permanently free from odor
1781918 smartsilver certified antimicrobial performance is a valuable and welcome innovation for wool fabrics now consumers can have the beauty and natural performance features merino wool provides along with permanent protection from odor smartsilver provides new options for apparel and footwear designers especially those in the active and outdoor markets where consumers strongly value odor resistance
1781919 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1781920 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1781921 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1781922 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1781923 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1781924 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
1781925 this is another important milestone in our revolutionary battery development
1781926 we are beginning to see customers seeking out our products for the unique characteristics that only altairnano technology can provide
1781927 the current program is only a beginning once the technology is proven in the field we fully expect interest and supply contracts from other u s and foreign military services
1781928 altairnano is proud to help improve the effectiveness of the men and women defending our nation
1781929 did not oppose the introduction of pay protection but rather their exclusion from it
1781930 the ruling that discriminatory pay protection is unlawful could pave the way for thousands of new equal pay claims against local authorities and the nhs
1781931 this would be in addition to the thousands of equal pay claims which are already in the system
1781932 in addition to providing a major headache for local authorities and the nhs this ruling also raises serious questions about how the employment tribunal system will cope with the avalanche of new equal pay claims we can now expect
1781933 the tribunal system is already clogged up and while the government is hoping that the new employment bill will help reduce tribunal claims overall these changes are unlikely to assist in settling equal claims without recourse to tribunals
1781934 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1781935 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1781936 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1781937 a husbands job is to earn income a wifes to take care of the children
1781938 a change in attitude is not the same thing as a change in behaviour but attitudes do matter
1781939 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1781940 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1781941 the time to buy is when the blood is in the streets
1781942 at a time when investors are culling through the wreckage of distressed debt instruments and delinquent subprime mortgages silver portal is venturing into largely uncharted territory the business of buying and managing foreclosed single family houses has typically been dominated by mom and pop landlords because it is considered too costly and labor intensive for institutional investors
1781943 the 2 million unit shortfall sounds like a large number of units but actually its less than about a months worth of a run rate
1781944 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1781945 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1781946 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1781947 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1781948 has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1781949 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year
1781950 i will purchase a new backpack from wal mart with all her school supplies but nothing else will be new at the beginning of the school year

1781962 it is unfair to lump the iga stores into the category of all independents in any one region igas national board chairman mick daly said
1781963 ukraine must immediately computerize every transaction to make it transparent and adopt eu customs procedures
1781964 when were talking about british investment in ukraine we should not forget the role london plays in channeling global investment into the country
1781965 the money that is invested in them can just as easily be invested in companies with mines in latin america or africa or real estate projects in the middle east or central asia london offers the worlds largest pool of capital and thus the broadest circle of potential shareholders or lenders as a result companies should be able to get the best possible price for their stock or bonds from that market
1781966 the vital condition is that they show the levels of transparency and corporate governance that the london market demands this is something that a lot of ukrainian companies have shied away from in the past but it is a discipline they will have to submit to in future if they want to attract capital to finance their growth
1781967 ukraine must immediately computerize every transaction to make it transparent and adopt european union customs procedures

1781991 back around october november the corps came in here and re established a base to work on and then came in and used some material from the site and barged in a tremendous amount of material to rebuild this levee
1781992 this could put a lot of our people in jeopardy

1782116 is applicable for all us government agencies whether its the department of defense department of state or any other part of the us government
1782117 the passage of the procurement package is actually a matter of course since it has been approved by the us president its budget had been passed by the legislature and the relevant preparations are almost all in place
1782118 china now can afford an arms race with taiwan the islands economy will collapse first if it wants to lock in such a race with china
1782119 our real concern is us intervention should there be a military conflict across the taiwan strait given its small size no matter how many weapons it buys from the us the taiwanese military could hardly defend itself without the help of uncle sam
1782120 the us is well aware of the possibility that the technologies in weapons it sells to taiwan could pass to china sooner or later in one way or another so it never wants to sell its most advanced weapons to taiwan
1782121 policy makers in washington are not fools who certainly would have taken this possibility into consideration when they decide on what weapons to sell to taiwan

1782511 do not judge according to appearance but judge with righteous judgment
1782512 you judge according to the flesh i judge no one and yet if i do judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i am with the father who sent me
1782513 i wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people
1782514 but the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
1782515 we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting but speaking the truth in love may grow up in all things into him who is the head christ
1782516 brethren if a man is overtaken in any trespass you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness considering yourself lest you also be tempted
1782517 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will
1782518 brethren if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins
1782519 but love your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high
1782520 and why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye but do not perceive the plank in your own eye
1782521 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
1782522 if i tell the truth why do you not believe me he who is of god hears gods words therefore you do not hear because you are not of god
1782523 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints do you not know that the saints will judge the world and if the world will be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters do you not know that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge i say this to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you not even one who will be able to judge between his brethren but brother goes to law against brother and that before unbelievers
1782524 you shall appoint judges and officers in all your gates which the lord your god gives you according to your tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment
1782525 you shall do no injustice in judgment you shall not be partial to the poor nor honor the person of the mighty in righteousness you shall judge your neighbor you shall not go about as a talebearer among your people nor shall you take a stand against the life of your neighbor i am the lord
1782526 the lord will judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
1782527 for by fire and by his sword the lord will judge all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many
1782528 when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know god and on those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus christ these shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints

1782561 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1782587 in reality seeks to modify the social and cultural reality of spain transforming its identity

1782613 if the dutch can protect a country that is 23 feet below sea level from a 1 in 10 000 storm then the united states of america should have certainly protected a region that is on average 18 inches below sea level from a 1 in 100 year storm

1782631 read this as slavery is to misread the asian condition
1782632 the purpose of the book is not to dictate a path but to open possibilities for the intelligent reader
1782633 we have not done as good a job as we should be doing on understanding the interaction of that project and other projects and other dynamics in a watershed
1782634 so for the last couple of years we have been adding that as a component to our planning process to think outside and understand the cumulative impacts of the projects on the watershed
1782635 what we did not do is each time we made another decision we didnt revisit go back to the root of the problem and say if you add risk a with risk b with risk c with risk d which would have accumulated over the years thats the total risk were talking about not the risk associated with the specific changes we might be making today
1782636 i think if we had these processes in place earlier that each time we made a decision about not to do barriers or not to do gates or whatever to go with i walls instead of t walls we would have had a much better appreciation for the cumulative risks we faced
1782637 to a condition equal to or better than their pre katrina condition
1782638 until we get the definitive elevation levels we are designing higher than we expect the final elevations to be just to be on the safe side
1782639 but the system continues to bleed about 85 million gallons of water a day more than two thirds of whats pumped through the pipes
1782640 these days state and local governments neighborhood groups historical societies and others must be consulted before the corps can push forward
1782641 will be or should be re engineered to ensure that the city is economically sustainable secure for investment safe for its residents and able to withstand future natural disasters
1782642 today is historic for louisiana because our state is finally on the road to receiving a sizable portion of the revenue generated from oil and gas production off our shores
1782643 the bill gives louisiana the necessary resources we need to restore our eroding coastline build strong levees and protect our people and infrastructure from future hurricane damage
1782644 the energy produced off the gulf coast not only serves louisiana but it serves the whole nation
1782645 this bill will increase our domestic energy supply decrease energy prices nationwide and provide jobs for hard working louisianians
1782646 the truman offer has finally been accepted for louisiana and the gulf states
1782647 it is the cornerstone that has been laid down to protect and rebuild the gulf coast
1782648 doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
1782649 nearly three quarters of 14 534 new orleanians whove applied for federal grants say theyll rebuild their hurricane katrina damaged homes in flood areas even though city restrictions are unlikely to protect their homes if the levees fail again
1782650 they wisely decided it would be a really good idea to have an external group look over their shoulder to review their work
1782651 perhaps they were concerned that no one would trust them otherwise
1782652 the one finding that really shocked me was the problems are everywhere
1782653 serious serious problems at almost every level i had not expected that
1782654 the problem essentially is that there are about 10 different agencies with different levels of responsibility but no one with any authority or responsibility for the entire system
1782655 we called it a sometimes poorly connected set of pieces rather than a thoughtfully integrated system
1782656 time has clearly taught us that the management can be just as important as the engineering in particular how critical decisions are made at critical times
1782657 you imagine building a nuclear power plant with nobody in charge a fundamental problem in new orleans is that no one is in charge
1782658 wouldnt it have been nice in new orleans if the governor of the state of louisiana had said well the states going to become responsible for and take charge of this
1782659 i dont think its practical to think that all these dozen or so entities that are involved are suddenly going to cede all of their authority to some king of levees
1782660 i think at some point youve got to lock these people in a room and say come up with a rational and reasonable plan to work together more effectively
1782661 fixing the engineering alone without fixing the fundamental management dysfunction will not necessarily solve the problem
1782662 there were about 50 sections of levee that failed and 46 of those 50 sections failed because of water rushing over the top and eroding the levees
1782663 years go by and we get a little bit drier period occasionally and we forget that it is inevitable that an awful drought will hit this area it just will happen its just a question of when it will happen
1782664 severe time pressures to get a decent final draft out by june 1 and even more importantly to get information to task force guardian
1782665 the ipet study didnt look at that and that kind of legal statement isnt supposed to be there
1782666 we are concerned that the corps has embarked on a multi billion repair and construction effort in response to the appropriations it has already received without a guiding strategic plan
1782667 once again taking an incremental approach that is based on funding
1782668 the way new orleans has been treated since katrina is one of the most shameful episodes in our nations history
1782669 and what about accepting some responsibility for building in a flood zone and not having insurance
1782670 we must place the protection of public safety health and welfare at the forefront of our nations priorities to do anything less could lead to a far greater tragedy than the one we have witnessed in new orleans
1782671 we now have a better understanding of what went wrong and why
1782672 were not designed to function in a major hurricane or mitigate flooding if the levees were overtopped or breached
1782673 evidenced by the fact that the system took decades to build and remains incomplete yet today
1782674 should establish and fund a program for nationwide levee safety and rehabilitation much as we do for major dams
1782675 if this is not done new orleans will remain unnecessarily vulnerable
1782676 we took the engineering out of the corps of engineers and thats in an attempt to become better faster cheaper project managers
1782677 the next weakest link is the one you have to be worried about
1782678 i think we can limp along through this hurricane season
1782679 with some divine intervention well be ok i just cant imagine were going to see another katrina
1782680 its all a matter of reducing the risk as quickly as we can
1782681 but a different storm from katrina on a different track with a different speed could do different damage
1782682 youre going to have what you had before katrina and thats all youre going to get
1782683 but based on the corps track record i have grave concerns
1782684 our city has been destroyed and it was the federal government that did it
1782685 people are as mad as they would be if al qaeda had hit us
1782686 when people think about getting hit by a hurricane they feel like those things are inevitable and just a chance you take in life
1782687 but after repeatedly being told by the corps that we were safe this is different
1782688 the break in the levees caused people to lose faith in the governments ability to protect them i gotta tell you im nervous more because of the frailty of the infrastructure than the power of any storm the corps is saying the levees will not break now but thats what they said last year
1782689 we have absolute confidence in the repair of the damaged portions
1782690 weve got a great system in place that will go a long way to protect new orleans
1782691 right now these levees are not going to do well with a combination of wave and storm surge
1782692 this is a work in progress and were going to have that progress perhaps interrupted by a hurricane
1782693 the corps is trying to do in a few months what it couldnt get done in 40 years if i lived in new orleans id get a second floor apartment and put my stuff in storage
1782694 i dont know about that i wouldnt stay this close
1782695 the wind coming through back here was like a freight train coming through there
1782696 i would say about 10 minutes after we saw it rising i was pretty certain that the levee had to be breached cause it was rising at such a rate
1782697 when i saw that im sure my coworkers had the same reaction my heart just dropped even though i knew the levees were breached before that
1782698 seeing it and just knowing the fate of the city was sealed
1782699 you took it in and you wondered how high the water was going to be in the city
1782700 my first instinct when we saw the levee break was this is bigger than 9 11 i thought the fatalities would be in the thousands if not the tens of thousands you know it was heavy
1782701 i guess it would have to be torture to know that you can see the water rising on your house and not being able to do anything about it
1782702 soon as we saw the water come into the parking lot im thinking people are going to be dying soon that was my first thought
1782703 he was standing on his bathtub with water up to his chin when we got over there and me and firefighter pat ball broke the window out and was able to rescue him
1782704 he wasnt saying much he could barely stand when we got him in i dont think he would have made it much longer the water was still rising at that point and i think he would have surely drowned in the next few minutes
1782705 i try not to think about it too much too many people suffering far too many people needed help

1782707 the costs were shown to be high and the benefits speculative
1782708 to the contrary the corps has not been able to use all moneys allocated
1782709 bad idea when constructed and has become a worse one every year

1782711 we think a lot can be done for a relatively small amount of money
1782712 the ability of any i wall in new orleans to withstand is unknown
1782713 it appears that this information never triggered an assessment neither at the time of the design of the 17th street canal flood wall nor following its construction
1782714 we have done the best things we could have done we live here
1782715 it was a question of who was going to pay and how much
1782716 we agree that every single foot of the i walls is suspect
1782717 when asked we have constantly urged anyone returning to new orleans to exercise caution because the system now in place could fail in a category 2 storm it has already failed during a fast moving category 3 storm that missed new orleans by 30 miles
1782718 overall pattern of engineering judgment inconsistent with that required for critical structures
1782719 these findings present significant implications for current and future safety offered by levees flood walls and control structures in new orleans and perhaps elsewhere

1782722 allah memiliki sembilan puluh sembilan nama seratus kurang satu barangsiapa memperhitungkannya dia masuk surga artinya mengenalnya dan melaksanakan hak hak nama nama itu
1782723 sungguh akan kami berikan cobaan kepadamu dan sedikit ketakutan penyakit kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan buah buahan
1782724 yang pertama tama dipertanyakan diperhitungkan terhadap seorang hamba pada hari kiamat dari amal perbuatannya adalah tentang shalatnya apabila shalatnya baik maka dia beruntung dan sukses dan apabila shalatnya buruk maka dia kecewa dan merugi
1782725 dan hendaklah ada diantara kamu orang orang yang mengajak kepada kebaikan dan menyeru kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar dan merekalah orang orang yang beruntung
1782726 serulah manusia kepada jalan tuhanmu dengan hikmah dan pelajaran yang baik dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang lebih baik
1782727 maka bertanyalah kepada orang yang mempunyai pengetahuan jika kamu tidak mengetahui
1782728 sedikit ilmu lebih baik dari banyak ibadah cukup bagi seorang pengetahuan fiqihnya jika dia mampu beribadah kepada allah dengan baik dan cukup bodoh bila seorang merasa bangga ujub dengan pendapatnya sendiri

1782736 tidak disengat seseorang mukmin itu dua kali dalam satu lubang
1782737 tiada seorang muslim tertusuk duri atau yang lebih dari itu kecuali allah mencatat baginya kebaikan dan menghapus darinya dosa
1782738 allah menguji hamba nya dengan menimpakan musibah sebagaimana seorang menguji kemurnian emas dengan api pembakaran
1782739 seorang hamba memiliki suatu derajat di surga ketika dia tidak dapat mencapainya dengan amal amal kebaikannya maka allah menguji dan mencobanya agar dia mencapai derajat itu
1782740 para nabi kemudian yang meniru menyerupai mereka dan yang meniru menyerupai mereka seseorang diuji menurut kadar agamanya kalau agamanya tipis lemah dia diuji sesuai dengan itu ringan dan bila imannya kokoh dia diuji sesuai itu keras seroang diuji terus menerus sehingga dia berjalan di muka bumi bersih dari dosa dosa
1782741 besarnya pahala sesuai dengan besarnya ujian dan cobaan sesungguhnya allah azza wajalla bila menyenangi suatu kaum allah menguji mereka barangsiapa bersabar maka baginya manfaat kesabarannya dan barangsiapa murka maka baginya murka allah
1782742 dan janganlah kamu bersikap lemah dan janganlah pula kamu bersedih hati padahal kamulah orang yang paling tinggi derajatnya jika kamu orang orang yang beriman

1782783 these topics range from the family to pollution poverty and the distribution of natural resources
1782784 we have noted that the pontiff holds more advanced views on this subject than most of society and we would like public broadcasters to devote more air time to inter religious dialogue

1782823 the strict relationship uniting the inspired biblical texts with the mystery of the incarnation was expressed by the encyclical divino afflante spiritu in the following terms just as the substantial word of god became like men in every respect except sin so too the words of god expressed in human languages became like human language in every respect except error eb 559 repeated almost literally by the conciliar constitution dei verbum 13 this statement sheds light on a parallelism rich in meaning

1782828 we recognize that gods merciful love is infinite eternal and embraces all things this love is central to both our religions in a radically different way for islam and the catholic church and is at the heart of the judeo christian islamic monotheistic heritage

1782831 denounce and deplore threats made against those who engage in interfaith dialogue
1782832 full visible communion as the aim of our dialogue really has receded further
1782833 that even in the midst of difficult circumstances you have sought the views and perspectives of your ecumenical partners even when you have not always particularly rejoiced in what we have said
1782834 what we are talking about is nothing other than faithfulness to christ himself
1782835 not only a disciplinary position but an expression of our faithfulness to jesus christ
1782836 effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
1782837 the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate is not only a matter of isolated provinces but that this is increasingly the stance of the communion
1782838 bishops are not in communion with other bishops in some instances anglican provinces are no longer in full communion with each other
1782839 what shape might the anglican communion of tomorrow take and who will our dialogue partner be
1782840 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
1782841 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
1782842 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
1782843 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
1782844 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
1782845 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
1782846 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
1782847 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
1782848 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
1782849 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
1782850 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
1782851 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
1782852 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
1782853 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
1782854 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
1782855 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
1782856 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
1782857 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
1782858 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
1782859 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
1782860 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
1782861 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
1782862 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
1782863 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
1782864 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling toward catholic unity
1782865 its a bit of a monument in the desert right now because its not going to be used as a prison

1782881 the time to ask these questions is now and not in the aftermath of the next great flood
1782882 i refuse to argue one side or the other and instead prefer to take the road which best ensures and protects public safety no matter the course of action
1782883 i am completely confident that the corps of engineers has done this with regard to the river structures to which you refer
1782884 river engineering is the 800 pound gorilla driving these flood levels higher
1782885 just thought i would share an e mail that was sent to me indicating the difference between the people in iowa and the people from new orleans
1782886 sort of opened my eyes read all the way to the bottom
1782887 how come in two weeks you will never hear about iowa flooding ever again
1782888 in eastern iowa the city that would never flood goes 12 feet under
1782889 have you all noticed that cedar rapids is under 10 feet of water
1782890 where is the hysterical 24 7 media coverage complete with reports of cannibalism
1782891 why isnt the federal government relocating iowa people to free hotels in chicago
1782892 the folks making these comparisons do not seem to be the folks whose lives are upside down at this time
1782893 as we know from the weeks after katrina we were worried about where our children would go to school or where our children would live
1782894 i believe these statements are coming from folks outside of the tragedy and by definition that means they dont have enough information
1782895 coastal wetlands provide horizontal levees that are maintained by nature and are far more cost effective than constructed levees
1782896 the experience of hurricane katrina provided a tragic example of the costs of allowing these natural capital assets to degrade
1782897 if the frequency and intensity of hurricanes increases in the future as some are predicting as a result of climate change then the value of coastal wetlands for protection from these storms will also increase
1782898 is proving to be an extremely cost effective strategy for society
1782899 for years officials have said they cant put a precise number on wetlands natural capital but thats really a lame excuse
1782900 the burden of proof should be on the parties that intend to remove that asset or intend to deplete it
1782901 i think the most significant thing is that people keep this in the forefront of their minds
1782902 once you start forgetting new orleans then were really going to be in trouble
1782903 these who had never been here before just again couldnt understand or couldnt imagine the magnitude of the devastation
1782904 in all fairness it is difficult to truly understand what happened unless you live here
1782905 at the risk of sounding insensitive for midwest flooding may actually help the people of this area because what happened in the midwest is actually the same thing that happened to us
1782906 i think yesterday the congressmen realized theres no quick fix or easy answers for the city
1782907 its going to take time its going to take their involvement over many many years and weve all got to recognize that
1782908 theres more to be done and we want to make sure they understand what needs to be done further
1782909 if you take property under eminent domain you have to compensate for it
1782910 these people are inflexible the corps of engineers wont listen to any reasonable argument
1782911 havent we paid enough havent the citizens of this area already paid enough in terms of livelihoods and lives lost due to the failure of the federal levees
1782912 obviously we tried to get it in the supplemental the white house was opposed to it we had difficulties we dont have it yet but were going to continue to try
1782913 we dont deserve to pay such a large match especially since these levees shouldve been built right in the first place had the levees been built right wed be well on our way to recovery right now
1782914 in response to the academy and the american society of civil engineers i created a nonmathematical description of what we did
1782915 this is likely due to the dominance of rainfall as the source of water at this level of event
1782916 strengthening of the i walls with stability berms and relief wells has improved the performance of the structures in the industrial canal but they remain unable to cope with surge conditions created by large storms
1782917 pumping will have little impact until all of the fundamental protective structures are completed
1782918 the vast majority of the region would experience flooding of greater than 8 feet
1782919 if anyone stays for another therre should be no rescue services offered either get out of fend for yourself we here in this bowl are in trouble and in turn must learn to be smarter than you were in katrina
1782920 btw most of new orleans is above sea level and all of the originally settled area of new orleans is well above sea level but sea level is irrelevant as shown by the midwest flooding all of the flooded midwest is between 400 1100 feet above sea level
1782921 we will build you levees and make sure this never happens again
1782922 start taking a billion dollars out of the general fund it strangles the recovery to be very honest
1782923 you get the sense theres still a lot of suffering and we as a nation have not given this tragedy the urgent attention and resources it needs
1782924 housing and health care issues abound and were still trying to fight our way through the government red tape three years later
1782925 in a lot of areas people are back to normal whatever normal might be
1782926 parts of the city dont look a lot different than last year or other than having the debris removed a whole lot different than the day after the storm
1782927 has been consistent in his commitment and efforts to rebuild the gulf coast
1782928 i thought people deserved to know whether or not theyre safe
1782929 so i wrote a program that converted the u s army corps of engineers list of at risk levees into a searchable database
1782930 forty three percent of the american population lives in areas protected by levees
1782931 clearly levee failure is not just a metro new orleans problem and we hope to get the word out
1782932 pay no attetion to the miles of i walls that still protect your eastern exposure people of new orleans
1782933 next we need to identify the civil engineers that designed these shoddy levees and bring them to justice
1782934 the list of vulnerable levees provided by the corps includes river levees not hurricane levees thus no vulnerable levees are listed for new orleans or louisiana there are 111 levees in louisiana federal and local listed below are 2 vulnerable federal levees in the states neighboring louisiana
1782935 levee failure is not just a metro new orleans problem and we hope to get the word out
1782936 the corps has been very cooperative but we hope to have our own peer review team that is put together and paid for by the authority
1782937 we not only think we may be able to get it done sooner but making it completely independent of the corps will add even more credibility with the public
1782938 but it will be better all the way around if we just find the money ourselves and handle the whole thing
1782939 if we dont there will always be some people who think the review isnt really independent
1782940 handling this ourselves will eliminate discussion and debate about who actually does the review and which agency actually gets the results first
1782941 working with the state and federal government just becomes very cumbersome i think we can expedite it if we control it
1782942 i think that right now in this case its good for the levee authority to take the lead and run this process
1782943 i work with the governor but i dont think we ought to be giving up that which is so important in the first defense of this city and this region and that is the money to let us rebuild the coast
1782944 our original request was give us 30 years and then well be fully capable of funding the levee match
1782945 when i suggested the partial use of royalties that certainly was not our first preference but a signal that the state is willing to be flexible
1782946 nobody has ever said no to us either in congress or the white house nobody ever said it was an unreasonable request
1782947 rising tide the great mississippi flood of 1927 and how it changed america
1782948 im really asking that they take a comprehensive look at the entire mississippi river system the entire mississippi valley from new york state to idaho
1782949 they should look for instance at the dams on the upper missouri river in detail because they have a real impact on the amount of sediment thats carried in the river which has a real impact on the erosion of wetlands in louisiana
1782950 if the nation understood the reality of the negative impacts on us in the metropolitan area of economic decisions upstream that were made in the national interest
1782951 courts have commonly held governments liable for increasing flood and erosion damages
1782952 be it further resolved the council also extends an invitation to local governments in iowa missouri and wisconsin to work together with our respective congressional delegations in the midwest and gulf coast to assure appropriate funding for disaster assistance through the passage of a second emergency supplemental appropriations bill and in seeking reforms in the stafford act

1782974 the floodwalls in new orleans were 15 years old and they failed
1782975 our levees are 100 years old we estimate we have one half the level of protection that new orleans had
1782976 there are only natural hazards and human hubris when you combine hazard with hubris then you get a disaster
1782977 how we guess at future behavior i dont know there is not a body of knowledge and science in that area that would allow us to do that
1782978 is it acceptable to have the worst natural disaster in u s history occur over and over again
1782979 i am happy that brian benczkowski has agreed to serve as my chief of staff
1782980 brian has been one of my closest advisers in the department since my confirmation process and his exceptional judgment and extensive experience in the department will be of great value to me and to the department in the upcoming months
1782981 you said that youre really trying to be a better bf but i am not letting you be
1782982 i am deeply saddened to learn about the tragic death of over 100 pilgrims i convey my deep felt condolences to the family members of all those who have lost their lives or have been injured in the incident
1782983 when i passed the chancellor he arose waved his hand at me and i waved back at him i think the writers showed bad taste in criticizing the man of the hour in germany
1782984 they the palestinians were asking to enter the state of israel after being threatened by hamas gunmen
1782985 the flow of blood was re started in intervals of 20 minutes because the anesthetists had to make sure that the patient would not suffer from the blood flowing back from the transplanted parts no significant swelling was seen nor indeed any ischemia lack of blood flow to the tissues this is a testament to the surgeons who established a fully functioning blood flow the main nerves the musculocutaneus radial and ulnar nerves were all attached and sewn together and finally an external fixator was applied with pins in the lower and upper arms avoiding the risk of pressure points and sores the operation was successfully completed after 15 hours
1782986 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
1782987 unlike leftist terrorism which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives black terrorism prefers the massacre because it promotes panic and impulsive reactions
1782988 ever since katrina the citizens of new orleans have been blamed because some parts of the city are below sea level
1782989 what happened in new orleans could happen anywhere but this problem had not been addressed until the recent midwest flooding
1782990 rising tide the great mississippi flood of 1927 and how it changed america
1782991 im not angry at the corps i think they can do the job
1782992 no liability of any kind shall attach or rest upon the united states for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place
1782993 fundamental to the plan is the acknowledgment that a change in culture within the corps will have to take place if the tenets are to be realized
1782994 theres an old saying in the corps we may not be fast but at least were expensive
1782995 the fact is there are a lot of things the corps knows need to be done and would like to do but congress is not funding the money to do it
1782996 you have a very compliant government entity that makes no judgments about anything
1782997 they have their own internal cost benefit analysis but the proclivity toward earmarking over the last 10 to 15 years makes a complete mockery out of that process
1782998 the biggest thing you have to change is the culture of the institution so that it factors in environmental sustainability as part of the mandate
1782999 the midwest flooding has spotlighted the magnitude of our failing infrastructure specifically with the failure of engineered levees
1783000 once again levee and engineering failure and the resulting devastation is before the american people
1783001 are you as safe as you think you are what happened here in new orleans could happen anywhere to you
1783002 i thought people deserved to know whether or not theyre safe
1783003 so i wrote a program that converted the corps of engineers list of at risk levees into a simple searchable data base
1783004 forty three percent of the american population lives in areas protected by levees
1783005 clearly levee failure is not just a metro new orleans problem and we must get the word out
1783006 congress and the citizens of louisiana look to the corps of engineers
1783007 unless some advice regarding promising initial projects for ecosystem restoration hurricane protection and buyouts and relocations is provided
1783008 the planning effort will fall short of its potential to offer science based analytical advice on hurricane protection and coastal ecosystem restoration
1783009 does not consider the potential for structural failure of levees and floodwalls
1783010 if wetlands cannot be maintained decision makers and citizens ultimately will have to make hard choices about where restoration can take place and where it cannot
1783011 this phenomenon took place in the decades prior to hurricane katrina
1783012 it is important that a similar process is not repeated in the future
1783013 we looked at the corps construction schedule and realized if we dont do this well be looking at a completion date of 2012 or beyond
1783014 if you can use lower quality materials and then armor the hell out of the levee and reach the same safety goal rather than barging expensive clay from mississippi we should have that choice
1783015 otherwise you are going to literally price communities out of protection and youre going to limit the impact and strength of the states limited dollars
1783016 im really asking that they take a comprehensive look at the entire mississippi river system the entire mississippi valley from new york state to idaho
1783017 they should look for instance at the dams on the upper missouri river in detail because they have a real impact on the amount of sediment thats carried in the river which has a real impact on the erosion of wetlands in louisiana
1783018 environmental advocates successfully sued to stop the projects as too damaging to the wetlands and the lakes eco system
1783019 these flood gates would have alleviated the flooding of new orleans caused by hurricane katrina
1783020 my heart goes out to the families who have been displaced by flood waters to the communities that have been washed away by the mississippi river and the communities still under threat it is a situation with which louisianians are all too familiar
1783021 nearly three years since hurricanes katrina and rita the flooding in the midwest this month punctuates the need for a major national investment in flood control infrastructure all over the united states
1783022 my subcommittee will continue working to reform fema and the stafford act and i will be working with my colleagues in the midwest to ensure the best possible government response to the floods i and all louisianians stand ready to support the affected states just as they stood with us in our most challenging time
1783023 instead of supplying relief to the city rove had devised a scheme whereby he could blame the failure of government to take action on someone besides bush
1783024 here was roves strategy praise haley barbour the republican governor of mississippi praise michael brown and fema blame louisiana governor kathleen blanco the democrat
1783025 rove sold the story as he had in the past through the media on wednesday while blanco was trying to get help from the white house her staff began receiving calls from reporters questioning her handling of the disaster almost all of them citing as their sources unnamed senior white house officials
1783026 water persistently seeping out of the 17th street canal near the repaired levee and floodwall indicates serious flaws in the design not only of that levee section but of much of the multibillion dollar 100 year hurricane protection for the region
1783027 i have been in touch with the american society of civil engineers asce and finally compiled a list of fifteen names of truly independent engineers who have not worked for the army corps of engineers usace
1783028 i truly feel a sense of duty in serving on the board i lost my home along
1783029 corps engineers maintain that the seepage is not cause for alarm
1783030 there are more people in the state of california in danger of catastrophic levee failure than in the states of texas louisiana and florida combined
1783031 this authority has never actually gone on record calling for such a position and i think we should
1783032 conduct an independent bipartisan investigation in the failure of the federal levees on august 29 2005 which flooded 80 percent of the city of new orleans
1783033 i dont delude myself for a moment that this resolution would have any impact
1783034 a national commission that looks at the big picture would be useful
1783035 ought to look at events leading up to aug 29 that would be my only comment
1783036 people think that means we will be safe for 100 years john kelly iii president of new orleans based model software corp said
1783037 people think that means a century it does not he said
1783038 there is a risk and there will always be a risk in south louisiana ebersole said
1783039 it may not be economical to get that level of protection he acknowledged
1783040 the federal government has not forgotten about south louisiana nor will the federal government forget about south louisiana she promised
1783041 were far better off than we were before katrina hit
1783042 the biggest storm surges occur in this pocket between the mouth of the mississippi river and the mississippi coast in an area most prone to hurricanes he added
1783043 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
1783044 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
1783045 regardless of what fema does we recognize that we have to handle the water issue
1783046 its going to be a lot of work in a short amount of time
1783047 thats the biggest concern the amount of time it would take
1783048 much of the discussion around levees have been on the engineering side
1783049 yet its incumbent upon us since its on the national mall for it to be a beautiful system
1783050 ever since katrina the citizens of new orleans have been blamed because some parts of the city are below sea level
1783051 what happened in new orleans could happen anywhere but this problem had not been addressed until the recent midwest flooding
1783052 the river was 6 feet higher two months ago and we were not that concerned since the levees here are 22 5 feet above the gulf since the lower mississippi river has been fairly dry the overall effect of the flooding up there is not expected to be that great here we will know in about two weeks for sure
1783053 the isrealites are sinning so im going to screw with the french thatll teach em
1783054 i have to thank sen byrd for not forgetting the people of the gulf coast and for not taking his eye off the ball
1783055 im very hopeful that well see some significant levee and recovery funding
1783056 its very important to really understand with this nonpartisan commission what happened and make sure this never happens again
1783057 provisions that help further the goals of the 8 29 commission
1783058 nobody will believe a study by the government that concludes that the government didnt mess up
1783059 levees can break in virtually any state in the country
1783060 this is really a national issue people have to stop thinking of this as a louisiana issue
1783061 the discharge of sediment from the upper missouri river basin virtually was stopped
1783062 i do feel weve been let down by the white house
1783063 we are not being properly treated the president has not been keeping his promise to the region
1783064 storm surge statistics reviewed old ideas are not holding up against newer research by the late mike dunne advocate staff writer july 5 2006 first posted at
1783065 for years scientists and bureaucrats repeated an often cited statistic hurricane storm surge falls 1 foot for every 2 7 miles of marsh and wetlands it must cross
1783066 early analysis by kemp lsu and co researcher hassan mashriqui lsu so far show
1783067 anyone who knows coastal louisiana knows how much the landscape has changed
1783068 to the president of the american society of civil engineers we hereby say publicly that we reject your threats
1783069 i am changing this to public allowing me to share my video with the world
1783070 today was a stand of sorts we showed the citizens of nola that the asce shall not bully shall not intimidate a small nonprofit and a bunch of high school kids out of exercising our first amendment rights
1783071 what is so scary is that these findings are currently being used to reconstruct greater new orleans entire hurricane protection system
1783072 im the guy who made that recommendation to the leadership of the corps of engineers because im not in a position to award the pump stations contract but i am in position to award a key contract on the ihnc
1783073 a system is only as good as its weakest link
1783074 in that 7 6 billion budget request is 430 million plus escalation costs that will allow us to build permanent protection on the outfall canals
1783075 in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation levee no 05 4 182 e d la
1783076 this decision if allowed to stand would mean that there is no congressional oversight nor review of the corps actions which in this instance resulted in the greatest engineering disaster in the history of this country
1783077 on a more personal level the families of the deceased and the thousands of families who lost everything will have no way of seeking some justice and restitution in this case well over 300 000 homes and businesses were wiped out because of the corps arbitrary capricious and in many instances even reckless acts in carrying out its congressional mandate now more than ever congress needs to conduct a full review of the corps conduct by establishing an august 29 commission similar to the one established after september 11th tragedy without delay we are calling upon all citizens to write their senators and congressmen to demand the corps be held accountable
1783078 this story fifty years in the making is heart wrenching millions of dollars were squandered in building a levee system with respect to these outfall canals which was known to be inadequate by the corps own calculations the byzantine funding and appropriation methods for this undertaking were in large part a cause of this failure
1783079 the cruel irony here is that the corps cast a blind eye either as a result of executive directives or bureaucratic parsimony to flooding caused by drainage needs and until otherwise directed by congress solely focused on flooding caused by storm surge nonetheless damage caused by either type of flooding is ultimately borne by the same public fisc such egregious myopia is a caricature of bureaucratic inefficiency
1783080 but the water is still showing up in a small area
1783081 were monitoring the area and well keep investigating to find the answer
1783082 but it is less than a fraction of the total cost of the work performed by task force guardian
1783083 we are going to finish these repairs but i dont think a 1 inch separation between a floodwall and a slab of concrete 10 to 20 feet wide would let enough water in to cause a catastrophic failure
1783084 to their credit they agreed and set about fixing things although its taken a lot longer than i would have hoped
1783085 the lack of vegetative cover on a levee that is not armored against water damage is an invitation for disaster
1783086 even though guardian used better materials to rebuild the levees in st bernard they still need a good grass cover
1783087 in hindsight sure some things could have been done differently
1783088 we were going so fast from one project to the other in some of the earlier contracts we used techniques that didnt work well but through trial and error we learned what worked best
1783089 we had slope paving that either pulled away from walls or cracked just like driveways and sidewalks crack
1783090 when we see these kinds of things we recommend that the levee districts not accept them but the guys with the corps realize they have a problem and they agree that these things have to be made right before they get turned over
1783091 most of that guardian work was just done so fast that i dont know how much design or forethought could have gone into it
1783092 i think theyre probably doing the best they can and they probably have too much to do but sometimes they do things that just dont make sense
1783093 we did the work south of bayou dupre last summer and although its still a little spotty were getting pretty good grass coverage there
1783094 well do whatever we have to get a good stand of grass out there
1783095 were confident that if we have a storm this season those levees wont wash away
1783096 we believe that when we get new specs that were comfortable with we can cure the long term problem
1783097 all that rutting goes with the lack of grass and were going to fix that
1783098 you hope that most of the subsidence has already occurred by now but well watch it closely to see
1783099 all the known task force guardian repairs that would cause us concern are being addressed before the season
1783100 we are going to finish these repairs but i dont think a 1 inch separation between a flood wall and a slab of concrete 10 to 20 feet wide would let enough water in to cause a catastrophic failure
1783101 we are going to finish these repairs but i dont think a 1 inch separation between a floodwall and a slab of concrete 10 to 20 feet wide would let enough water in to cause a catastrophic failure
1783102 we have something to say today to the president of the american society of civil engineers
1783103 we reject your threats and we will not stop publicizing our video
1783104 while this may not be a criticism the asce enjoys it is nonetheless a fully protected exercise of free speech on the part of levees org
1783105 the army corps of engineers asked the american society of civil engineers to hand pick some members to find the truth
1783106 then they paid them nearly a million dollars and awarded them medals of honor way to go guys
1783107 our video illustrates what we believe to be wrong with the relationship between the asce and the corps
1783108 we stand by all of the facts that are asserted in our video
1783109 initially we bowed to the threat of legal action not because we felt we had done anything wrong but because we lacked the money to defend ourselves against a powerful international trade group but now that two prominent law firms adams and reese llp and cooley godward kronish llp have offered to defend our first amendment rights on a pro bono basis we are prepared to defend ourselves in court if necessary
1783110 direct a speedy internal ethics probe and to make the results public
1783111 a truly independent and complete analysis of the flood protection failures in metro new orleans
1783112 we feel that the existence of an ethics probe looking into possible collusion between the corps and asce is one more compelling reason for the 8 29 investigation
1783113 a hero is somebody willing to risk all to gain all it doesnt matter whether he wins or not what matters is he tries what matters is what he tries for
1783114 i dont think youre proving your point by showing maps like this
1783115 were going to have our pumps on were going to pump that so why would you show a map with no pumping
1783116 if we dont get significantly more help in paying for 100 year flood protection we will not get 100 year protection by 2011 as promised and it may even take us
1783117 they want to make sure that they do things the right way and that they learn lessons from the studies they do
1783118 to promulgate misleading studies and statements to subvert appropriate independent investigations to literally attempt to change some of the critical apparent answers regarding lessons to be learned
1783119 well our people live here in new orleans we dont stand behind our work we live behind our work
1783120 i hope someone looks into the people making the accusations
1783121 a battle for the ethics and soul of the profession
1783122 we proposed gates and local citizens said no fearing flooding from rainfall
1783123 we thought the greater risk was from storm surge feet instead of inches
1783124 if we had to do that again id say heres the risk of flooding from rainfall and heres the risk of flooding from storm surge
1783125 id lay it out for the local folks and then for the congress and then for the public
1783126 but if he has anything like this we need to hear it quickly

1783135 when i woke up i was in the middle of a row of bodies waiting for postmortem
1783136 towering over me the doctors and nursing staff looked dazed they must have been surprised to see a dead man come alive like that but when was i dead
1783137 people were dumped quite haphazardly into trucks without following any procedure or checking if they were alive
1783138 no medical examinations were held and anybody found unconscious was assumed dead
1783139 if i dont hear from you within 24 hours i will reclaim the land
1783140 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1783141 there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1783142 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was
1783143 the message should not be sugar coated must be in clear easy to understand language and in our opinion needs to come from the engineer who designed and is responsible for the hurricane system
1783144 no one understands or should understand the limitations of the hurricane protection system better than the corps of engineers
1783145 evacuation and emergency planning appears to be the only means available in the near term to provide significant additional protection to human health and welfare in the new orleans area
1783146 theres a natural human tendency to downplay risks and to think that things are better than they really are
1783147 but in this case the risk is potentially life threatening
1783148 weve certainly been engaged with trying to provide input with local communities about our structures and the work thats being done and on evacuations and evacuation routes
1783149 well have a more comprehensive and coordinated public information campaign this year at the governors direction
1783150 levees org has much reason to doubt the reliability of the flood protection system currently being redesigned and constructed to protect the lives and property of 1 5 million americans
1783151 an independent investigation to examine and make recommendations regarding louisianas flood protection is vital to re establishing public trust
1783152 asce stands behind the findings of its external review panel which highlighted major failures in the design and construction of the levees and made recommendations to enhance the safety of new orleans in the future
1783153 risk and reliability analysis of the new orleans areas 350 mile hurricane protection system began in earnest
1783154 the region and the nation are looking to the ipet for clear statements about hurricane and flood risks and the ipet team may be losing an opportunity to issue an authoritative statement on these topics the committee warned in a report released thursday
1783155 prompt completion of the ipet study is in the better interest of both the ipet and the many stakeholder groups in the new orleans region
1783156 i think thats pretty optimistic wayne clough chairman of the committee and president of the georgia institute of technology said
1783157 the sooner the better get it right but get it done
1783158 we agreed with the panel then in december that the volume needed clarity and better explanation of the analysis he said
1783159 the documentation of the ipet risk work must be both comprehensive and understandable this work is setting the mark for future risk analyses in louisiana and elsewhere
1783160 minimize and understate the corps role in the levee failures
1783161 a big all encompassing investigation an independent federal probe of the levee failures similar to the investigation conducted after the sept
1783162 8 29 investigation katrina hit on aug 29 2005 would mirror that of the 9 11 commission
1783163 thorough and independent analysis of the events leading up to august 29 2005 landrieu who tried to add an 8 29 commission as an amendment to the 2007 water resources bill said she will introduce a stand alone 8 29 commission bill when congress returns from recess next week
1783164 but theres nothing under the current plan that would prohibit them from doing a peer review having the peer review come back and find major flaws and the corps simply ignoring the reviews findings theres no binding attribution to the peer review
1783165 great reservations and the feeling of a gun to our head we plan to sign the contract today
1783166 it doesnt listen to us ive spent a year and a half using all my professional skills to try to make the corps do things right and ive been unsuccessful i am not going to take another term on this board
1783167 and one of the requirements of being a professional is being able to understand and control conflicts of interest its in our rules and regulations both in the state of louisiana and asce
1783168 the new orleans levees the worst engineering catastrophe in u s history what went wrong and why
1783169 designed to protect the corps reputation and shift blame on the locals
1783170 and tom jackson is the president of the east side levee board and so its really exciting that weve got someone in charge which is what the recommendation was
1783171 i think anybody who thinks a levee board whether the new east bank board the west bank board or any of them has any say so whatsoever about what the corps does is fooling themselves
1783172 you can bring people into situations where you cause them to do things they wouldnt independently do
1783173 dedication to learning the truth about why the hurricane protection system in new orleans failed during hurricane katrina and his commitment to sharing all lessons learned with the profession industry and public
1783174 critic corps tried to thwart inquiry engineer submits ethics complaint
1783175 we consider professor seeds letter to be confidential and we will continue to honor that principle even if others do not
1783176 the most significant statement the corps has made on this issue
1783177 some computations show the wall is going to fail at certain water levels some show it wont
1783178 the bottom line is that this city was destroyed and the public doesnt yet have an undisputed explanation
1783179 there are a lot of questions that have yet to be answered
1783180 there have been numerous studies about katrina without any clear direction of how to prevent a flood control system failure in the future
1783181 how these public relations professionals can transform masters of techno babble into credible spokespersons so quickly and smoothly is an amazing thing to behold
1783182 three key messages that the interviewee can always fall back on in touchy situations
1783183 for a lot of these levees you could not prevent this
1783184 there is no way to predict whether these levees will break thats a crystal ball that nobody has
1783185 the operation of that reservoir was going just as planned and just as expected we were preventing flooding but as you know and i know that rain came and never stopped
1783186 from a cinderella season for the new orleans saints to another possible national championship in the superdome for lsu from hospitality industry high notes to lowbrow whore mongering by u
1783187 and gearing up for the bcs championship game and the nba all star game this spring
1783188 and that certain areas were not nearly as protected as originally thought days later the corps recanted saying the original calculations were indeed correct but the affair only bolstered calls for better oversight of the corps levees org continued to push for an 8 29 commission to investigate the floodwall failures of hurricane katrina in addition the group posted a video spoofing the corps allegedly cozy relationship with the american society of civil engineers which the corps hired to investigate
1783189 and the parody returned to the internet the asce issued a statement saying it considered the matter resolved
1783190 not to mention celebrities like brad pitt who unveiled his make it right
1783191 but lsu offered all 143 members of the outgoing legislature the option to buy tickets to the sold out game at face value a perk not available to the public angola officials meanwhile announced a jan 16 execution date for one of legers 81 fellow inmates on death row
1783192 skipping several major city council meetings such as the adoption of the 2008 budget
1783193 and claiming that he is busting my butt every day
1783194 it means we are cleaning up our mess some of those cases reflected crooks taking advantage of post katrina opportunities
1783195 allegedly from congressman bill jeffersons brother mose jefferson there was no shortage of irony in brooks simms guilty plea since she campaigned as a reformer against corruption during her tenure and welcomed the fbi to set up shop in the school districts central office her conviction also squelched all talk of reinstating orleans parish school board control over the bulk of public schools following the states post katrina takeover dollar bills decline as dramatic as those developments were they paled in comparison to the corruption case of congressman bill jefferson who was indicted on 16 counts relating to racketeering bribery and obstruction of justice after fbi agents raided his home and offices in 2005 jefferson has taken a lawyerly tack in his defense arguing that the thousands he took in payments and stock were part of his private business dealings and that his actions in furtherance of high tech companies seeking his aid were not official acts
1783196 possibly in connection with his onetime support of jeffersons re election in 2006 shepherd lashed out at a press conference and said that the feds tried to bully him he dropped the names jefferson state rep karen carter and mayor ray nagin as persons of interest all either refused to comment or blasted shepherd for dragging their names through the mud the feds say they are moving forward with their investigation into shepherd who had just won re election cause for optimism new orleans can take some solace in the hiring and full funding of the citys new inspector general robert cerasoli who appears to be on track to have the support he needs to get his office up and running the ethics mandate
1783197 and adding a circus like tone to the whole affair when another family values republican u s sen larry craig of idaho was arrested in a bathroom sex sting targeting homosexuals in a minneapolis airport vitter was thrust back into the national spotlight this time amid comparisons of the disparate treatment the two senators received from their own party over their respective scandals changing of the guard amazingly louisiana saw some changes in leadership that didnt involve corruption or scandal gov kathleen blancos uninspired performance during the darkest days of hurricane katrina and the even poorer performance of her road home program proved to be her final undoing as she chose not to run for re election shes come undone
1783198 staying on budget uniting the district and meeting the demands of a burgeoning student population
1783199 and by years end the state approved even more charter schools for the city local charter schools have shown some encouraging first year results but new orleans school children remain on average at least one grade level behind their contemporaries katrina on trial hurricane katrina itself finally got its day in court in 2007 in a manner of speaking the so called memorial hospital case saw no charges brought against dr anna pou and two nurses after state attorney general charles foti arrested them for murder foti accused pou and the nurses of injecting patients with a lethal cocktail
1783200 arguing that the magnitude of the storm was the real culprit not the manganos
1783201 made a strong comeback with 41 film and television projects statewide qualified for tax incentives this year
1783202 and debating the accuracy of local depictions anybody up for a gumbo party the hollywood writers strike brought the show to a premature end
1783203 and then fell after triple overtime losses to kentucky and arkansas
1783204 and got off to their best start in franchise history
1783205 to develop evidence or data to support a defensible set of capacity enhancement projects
1783206 if the demand curves traffic growth projections and associated variables do not capture the need for navigation improvements then we have to figure out some other way to do it
1783207 we have been encouraged to have our study managers not take no for an answer
1783208 the push to grow the program is coming from the top down
1783209 oh my god my god i have no idea what youre talking about
1783210 if you only made these judgments based on past history youd never do anything
1783211 a plan that gets the corps back in the business of building for the future rather than haggling about predicting it
1783212 the funding for ecosystem restoration will keep the land around these mighty rivers clean and beautiful
1783213 although it was expressly not our intent the press release was interpreted by some to be supportive of the corps instead of being critical of the mistakes the corps made
1783214 a few outspoken critics have even castigated asce for appearing to pander to the corps and for apparently being apologetic for the many corps mistakes made in the design and construction of the pre katrina hurricane protection system
1783215 this could not be further from the intent of the press release
1783216 the army corps of engineers asked the american society of civil engineers to hand pick some members to find the truth
1783217 i believe another catastrophic flood in this city would be the end of this great city
1783218 its time the taxpayer gravy train left the new orleans station
1783219 take some initiative the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end
1783220 the problem is that until 2011 if in fact its done by that year we will remain vulnerable
1783221 especially since everyone knows the levee walls on either side of the canal are not strong enough
1783222 frankly the city of new orleans has been less engaged in decisions involving hurricane protection than we should be
1783223 but flooding that could happen because of canal wall failures is a citywide issue
1783224 we consider professor seeds letter to be confidential and we will continue to honor that principle even if others do not
1783225 asce is conducting an ongoing investigation into his allegations in accordance with our strict ethical code
1783226 the corps has great confidence in the analytical work done by the interagency performance evaluation task forces team of more than 150 scientific and engineering professionals from academia government and industry in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
1783227 i would never have imagined that i would live to see select elements of two of the worlds pre eminent civil engineering organizations the corps and asce two organizations with tremendous public trust and responsibility be caught behaving so badly
1783228 a battle for the ethics and soul of the profession
1783229 dont run that levee through my constituents neighborhood put it over there
1783230 an internet was sent by my staff at 10 oclock in the morning on friday i got it yesterday
1783231 its a nicer neighborhood theres no crime well established schools
1783232 no i want to live uptown as close to the river as possible lakeview is nice but its 2 feet below sea level and i dont want to be there when a hurricane hits
1783233 one day a storm could come up through the rigolets surcharge the lake and overtop the levees and i dont want to be around for that
1783234 if the corps couldnt provide a decent flood control system before katrina why would we trust them to do it now
1783235 thanks very much your sadly predictable finger pointing response demonstrates the corps blame shifting culture better than i could have hoped pathetic
1783236 oversight of the flood protection system must be moved to a financially independent academic review team similar to reeds or van herdeens
1783237 if the corps couldnt provide a decent flood control system before katrina why would we trust them to do it now
1783238 make no mistake the corps cares more about keeping their jobs than how many more po folks gonna die in the next storm
1783239 no matter how hard we try to make an entity independent politicians find a way to muck it up
1783240 no matter what happens were doomed so we shouldnt even try
1783241 unsupported claim that only non farmed out designs were flawed needs substantiation
1783242 immediately after the flood the corps requested that asce appoint an
1783243 since 1958 the army corps was on written notice that the mrgo posed a serious threat to human life and property in greater new orleans
1783244 despite repeated warnings from knowledgeable experts and public officials over the next 47 years before katrina the army corps did nothing to mitigate or prevent the very calamity that occurred during katrina this lawsuit seeks to expose this egregious legacy of our governments dereliction of duty not only to compensate plaintiffs but to prevent such a travesty from ever occurring again
1783245 the federal government knew that if we had a large hurricane we would probably be flooded
1783246 im angry because people drowned we lost everything we had and this could have been avoided
1783247 because the flood damages alleged by plaintiffs resulted from floodwaters that the united states sought but failed to control this case must be dismissed
1783248 the united states should not be immunized for a claim which occurred from an activity unrelated to a flood control project
1783249 taken to its logical conclusion such a policy would yield absurd results
1783250 it simply cannot be that the government can build a channel that they know is going to increase storm surge and they dont do anything but sit idly by
1783251 next to president bush i cant think of anyone who deserves more applause for his actions when katrina caused the water to jump over the levees
1783252 sure i spent a week up on my roof but i knew that somewhere in washington d c general strock was thinking about me
1783253 his dedication to learning the truth about why the hurricane protection system in new orleans failed during hurricane katrina and his commitment to sharing all lessons learned with the profession industry and public
1783254 were going to ask people to turn up to the buildings even if they dont exist
1783255 he is and hes in charge of oil gas and chemical facilities
1783256 after a decade of government and independent reports calling for reforming the corps and pointing out stunning flaws in corps projects and project studies and after the tragic failures of new orleans levees during hurricane katrina the american people deserve meaningful reforms to ensure that the projects the corps builds are safe appropriate environmentally responsible and fiscally sound the urgency and necessity could not be clearer
1783257 with only 2 billion annually appropriated for project construction this means that the nations most pressing needs face significant competition for funding and likely delays
1783258 ensuring that americans tax dollars are spent on the most important priorities not just on members pet projects
1783259 ever since katrina the citizens of new orleans have been blamed because some parts of the city are below sea level
1783260 what happened in new orleans could happen anywhere but this problem had not been addressed until the recent midwest flooding
1783261 the river was 6 feet higher two months ago and we were not that concerned since the levees here are 22 5 feet above the gulf since the lower mississippi river has been fairly dry the overall effect of the flooding up there is not expected to be that great here we will know in about two weeks for sure
1783262 im really asking that they take a comprehensive look at the entire mississippi river system the entire mississippi valley from new york state to idaho
1783263 they should look for instance at the dams on the upper missouri river in detail because they have a real impact on the amount of sediment thats carried in the river which has a real impact on the erosion of wetlands in louisiana
1783264 civil engineers have the knowledge and the tools to predict flooding this flooding is in most cases mere feet higher than usual this is not flooding of biblical proportions yet tens of billions of property and livelihoods are lost
1783265 coaches and captains are always going to have different views because they look at the game from a different angle
1783266 but ive always found kevin fine what i like about him is that hes got his views which can be pretty forthright
1783267 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down and talk to him about where he was coming from and what his views were and whether they matched mine by the end we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place
1783268 hell be different to michael vaughan because hes a different man michael had his style and that was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial
1783269 hell be his own man and thats going to be really important whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him
1783270 squandered millions of dollars in building a levee system which was known to be inadequate by the corps own calculations
1783271 it is not within the courts power to address the wrongs committed it is hopefully within the citizens of the united states power to address the failures of our laws and agencies
1783272 i knew we had an uphill battle but we had to do it
1783273 its an outrage read the opinion the judge reads through all the negligence by the corps but says he had to rule the way he had to
1783274 anybody that calls themselves the army corps of engineers should be embarrassed
1783275 we will stick with our mission of education that this was the worst engineering failure since chernobyl
1783276 the byzantine funding and appropriation methods for this undertaking were in large part a cause of this failure
1783277 an initial study of 20 749 subjects showed that subjects with periodontitis had a 24 increased risk of coronary heart disease relative to those had minimal periodontal disease
1783278 once this happens it may trigger type 2 diabetes even in healthy individuals with no other risk factors for diabetes
1783279 raise serious doubts that the system can withstand the pounding of another hurricane the size of katrina even after 3 1 billion in repairs are completed
1783280 and they got it wrong when the entire world is watching and a city has been destroyed you want to get it right
1783281 who the heck is this guy and what did he ever do to get the gig
1783282 what if brett favre were to come back and play for the team he led for 16 years without skipping a beat
1783283 she had a bunch of meetings and things planned for fashion week including meetings for her own line but shes postponed everything
1783284 they are perfectly the same as their daddy i am in heaven here i am a happy person
1783285 booger the dog had a kindness in his heart and i believe that kindness is something that can be i dont want to use the word reproduced but the best way dr lee explained it is we can give him his body you are going to give him the love and environment to recreate the original boogers personality

1783300 youre confused it wasnt me who had the affair with ms hunter it was andrew young both of them have already admitted it publically as the son of a mill worker i tell you that if i had known that mr young and ms hunter would leave me hanging out to dry i would have cut off our relationship with a eight and half inch compound miter saw instead i have tried to shield them even at the expense of my own reputation i have allowed these rumors about me to continue even though i knew the truth out of a misguided sense of loyalty to these people so with deep regret i must both renounce and reject my former friends and employees

1783339 we have hundreds of kilometers of beaches that arent developed and its a waste said the then honduran tourism secretary iht ana abarca in 2001
1783340 the british invasion of saint vincent in 1796 prompted a forced migration of the black caribs first to jamaica and soon thereafter to the island of roatan which today belongs to honduras
1783341 as roatan is quite small and infertile the garifuna struggled to subsist
1783342 our culture is based upon establishing a harmony with our natural environment
1783343 it is the garifuna communities two most salient attributes the simple beauty of their territory and the uniqueness of their vibrant culture that pose a threat to their existence
1783344 we dont want the mega tourist industry here says miriam miranda executive committee member of ofraneh black fraternal organization of honduras the most prominent organization representing the garifuna people
1783345 the utmost peril against the garifuna people today is the loss of our land
1783346 starting in 1992 the marbella tourist corporation and other foreign investors in complicity with local authorities and military personnel began usurping property rights within the triunfo de la cruz community facing the risk of losing communal land titles local and national organizations came together to expose the corruption and managed so suspend the fraudulent operations
1783347 we find ourselves in a what can only be conceived as a war like situation
1783348 such mega development valued at us 161 million seeks to promote honduras image as a top notch touristic destination the first hotel should be finished in a year and a half and according to the schedule the 18 hole golf course will be completed two months earlier
1783349 in miami and tornabe the company has managed to buy off several local leaders
1783350 here we will resist until our death only in coffins will they manage to get us out of here
1783351 in addition by drying out the body of water neighboring communities are left unprotected to the rising number of tropical storms and hurricanes which develop in the caribbean
1783352 international financial organizations are also playing a role in this conflict
1783353 what will happen to my kids the day im no longer around i will not sell out i want them to have this land after me
1783354 the garifuna essence our customs traditions and language are all directly tied to our lifestyle
1783355 any brother who wants to share our cosmovision is welcome but we do not want this touristic mega project here
1783356 we built them for the tourists as sun shelters we want them to come visit us
1783357 we want a project that belongs to us we dont want outsiders to come and exploit us or remove us from our ancestral lands we want to develop an eco tourism industry which is ours and which will sustain our garifuna cosmovision and respect the natural environment

1783361 im m rz 1985 unterzeichnete pr sident reagan die national security decision directive 166 durch welche eine verst rkte milit rische unterst tzung der mudschaheddin genehmigt wurde und welche ebenfalls die neuen ziele des geheimen krieges in afghanistan offenbarte den sieg ber die sowjetischen truppen in afghanistan durch verdeckte aktionen sowie den r ckzug der sowjets aus afghanistan
1783362 mit unterst tzung der vereinigten staaten wurden durch den pakistanischen diktator general zia ul haq tausende religi ser schulen erbaut die sich zu keimzellen der taliban entwickelten
1783363 weder ich noch meine br der konnten hinweise f r eine amerikanische hilfe erkennen
1783364 die beziehungen zwischen der isi und der cia waren durch die von general zia durchgef hrte amtsenthebung bhuttos und die implementierung des milit rregimes immer intensiver geworden pakistans haltung war in weiten teilen des afghanistankrieges sehr antisowjetisch gepr gt mehr als dies jemals in den usa der fall gewesen war schon kurz nach der sowjetischen invasion in afghanistan im jahr 1980 schickte zia ul haq seinen isi chef los um die sowjetischen republiken in zentralasien zu destabilisieren die cia stimmte diesem vorhaben erst im oktober 1984 zu sowohl pakistan als auch die vereinigten staaten nahmen im bezug auf afghanistan in der ffentlichkeit die rolle von verhandelnden partnern ein w hrend man sich im hintergrund darauf einigte dass eine milit rische eskalation der weg der wahl sein sollte hierbei gingen die usa aber wesentlich vorsichtiger vor als pakistan

1783366 das kapital der cia kontrollierte ebenfalls diesen heroinhandel als die guerillas der mudschaheddin regionen afghanistans besetzten wiesen sie die dort ans ssigen bauern an opium als eine art revolution re steuer anzubauen jenseits der grenze in pakistan unterhielten afghanische anf hrer und einheimische syndikate unter dem schutz des pakistanischen geheimdienstes hunderte heroinlabore in diesem jahrzehnt des offenen drogenhandels konnten keinerlei bedeutsame durchsuchungen oder verhaftungen durch die u s drug enforcement agency us amerikanische drogenverfolgungsbeh rde in islamabad durchgesetzt werden

1783370 weit ber die versorgung der tschetschenen mit waffen und fachwissen hinausgeht die isi und ihre radikalen islamischen vertreter bestimmen den verlauf dieses krieges
1783371 im jahr 1994 organisierte die pakistanische isi f r basayev und seine treuen offiziere eine intensive islamische indoktrination und ein training in guerillakriegsf hrung im camp amir muawia in der provinz khost in afghanistan dieses camp wurde in den fr hen 1980er jahren von der cia und der isi gegr ndet und von dem ber chtigten afghanischen kriegsherrn gulbuddin hekmatyar geleitet im juli 1994 wurde basayev nach absolvierung des camps amir muawia nach markaz i dawar gebracht einem camp in pakistan wo er sich einem training in fortgeschrittener guerillataktik unterzog hier traf er auch auf die hochrangigsten pakistanischen milit r und geheimdienstoffiziere verteidigungsminister general aftab shahban mirani innenminister general naserullah babar sowie den leiter der isi abteilung zur unterst tzung islamischer angelegenheiten general javed ashraf mittlerweile alle pensioniert diese verbindungen auf h chster ebene sollten sich bald als sehr n tzlich f r basayev erweisen
1783372 tschetschenische kriegsherren damit immobilien im kosovo mittels mehrerer immobilienunternehmen die zur vertuschung in jugoslawien angemeldet waren aufzukaufen
1783373 1995 nach tschetschenien zu den mudschaheddin kam die damals von ibn ul khattab angef hrt wurden er begann den tschetschenischen mudschaheddin unterricht ber die lehren des islam der richtigen aqeedah zu geben da viele ungenaue und verzerrte vorstellungen hier ber kursierten
1783374 diese wahhabiten gruppen sind eine kleine aber sehr gut situierte und ausger stete minderheit mit ihren anschl gen verfolgen sie das ziel den terror in die herzen der massen zu tragen sie verbreiten anarchie und gesetzlosigkeit und setzen auf diese weise ihre eigene form eines brutalen und intoleranten islam durch solche gruppen vertreten nicht die vorherrschende meinung der meisten gl ubigen muslime und islam gelehrten ber den islam denn f r diese ist der islam das beispiel f r eine vorbildliche gesellschaft und eine perfekte moral die wahhabiten sind nichts anderes als eine anarchistische bewegung unter islamischer flagge sie wollen aber keinen islamischen staat schaffen sondern einen zustand der verwirrung in dem sie gut und erfolgreich leben k nnen
1783375 pakistan hat den rebellengruppen in lashkar und jaish mittels seines geheimdienstes isi geldmittel waffen trainingseinrichtungen und hilfe bei der grenz berschreitung zur verf gung gestellt
1783376 ja aus den kreisen der exil pakistani und kashmirer in england kamen millionen von dollar pro jahr und auch von den sympathisanten der wahhabiten am persischen golf kam unterst tzung
1783377 ja der anf hrer der harakat farooq kashmiri khalil unterzeichnete 1998 die erkl rung osama bin ladens mit der zu angriffen auf amerikaner auch zivilisten und deren verb ndeten aufgerufen wurde bin laden steht us amerikanischen und indischen beh rden zufolge au erdem unter verdacht die jaish finanziert zu haben ausserdem reiste der gr nder der jaish maulana massoud azhar mehrere male zu treffen mit bin laden nach afghanistan
1783378 viele von ihnen nahmen an den gleichen ideologischen trainingseinheiten oder muslimischen seminaren in den madrasas teil wie die taliban oder die ausl ndischen s ldner in afghanistan ihre milit rische ausbildung erhielten sie in afghanischen camps oder in d rfern im pakistanisch kontrollierten kaschmir erst k rzlich wurden etliche neue madrasas in azad kaschmir durch extremistengruppen errichtet
1783379 verl ssliche quellen berichten dass die vereinigten staaten nun 1994 aktiv an der aufr stung und dem training der muslimischen truppen bosnien herzegowinas teilhaben dies steht im direkten widerspruch zu den vereinbarungen der vereinten nationen us organe lieferten waffen die in china prc nordkorea dprk und iran hergestellt wurden dieselben quellen deuteten an dass iran unter kenntnis und billigung der usa die bosnische armee mit einer gro en anzahl mehrfachraketenwerfer und einer beachtlichen menge an munition belieferte diese lieferungen beinhalteten 107mm und 122mm raketen aus der volksrepublik china sowie vbr 230 mehrfachraketenwerfer aus iran au erdem sollen 400 mitglieder der iranischen revolutionsgarde pasdaran iranian revolutionary guard pasdaran mit gro en mengen an waffen und munition nach bosnien gekommen sein es wurde angenommen dass die cia hiervon umfassende kenntnis hatte und dass sie davon ausging dass einige dieser 400 pasdaran mitglieder f r zuk nftige terroranschl ge in westeuropa eingesetzt w rden die us regierung hat ihre beteiligung an dem heimlichen versto gegen das un waffenembargo bisher in keinster weise eingeschr nkt des weiteren wurden innerhalb der letzten zwei jahre vor 1994 drei hochrangige delegationen entsandt um die jugoslawische regierung auf amerikanischen kurs zu bringen jedoch vergeblich damit ist jugoslawien der einzige staat der region der sich dem druck der usa nicht beugt
1783380 dazu beigetragen zu haben in bosnien eine basis f r militante islamisten geschaffen zu haben
1783381 am bedenklichsten f r die sfor mission und was noch wichtiger ist f r die sicherheit des amerikanischen personals welches in bosnien dient ist wahrscheinlich die weigerung der clinton regierung dem kongress und dem amerikanischen volk gegen ber zuzugeben welche rolle die usa bei der lieferung von waffen aus iran an die muslimische regierung in sarajevo spielten
1783382 eine zentrale rolle bei der drastischen zunahme des iranischen einflusses in bosnien

1783384 bin laden selbst war schon in albanien gewesen er war einer unter etlichen fundamentalistengruppen die einheiten in den kosovo zum kampf entsendet hatten man nimmt an dass bin laden 1994 eine operation in albanien auf die beine gestellt haben soll albanischen quellen zufolge hatte der damalige pr sident sali berisha verbindungen zu organisationen die sich im nachhinein als extrem fundamentalistisch herausgestellt hatten
1783385 was der ffentlichkeit gr tenteils verschwiegen wurde war die tatsache dass die u k einen teil ihres budgets aus dem drogenhandel bezog
1783386 das us au enministerium f hrte die u k als terroristische vereinigung mit dem hinweis dass diese ihre operationen mit mitteln aus dem internationalen heroinhandel und krediten von islamischen staaten und einzelpersonen unter ihnen wahrscheinlich auch osama bin laden durchf hrte
1783387 1998 99 begannen wir beziehungen zur u k aufzubauen und das war der moment in dem bin laden auf der bildfl che erschien
1783388 der kampf f r die u k ein kampf f r menschenrechte und die amerikanischen werte
1783389 wir befinden uns in einem krieg gegen den terrorismus wir k nnen nicht bei bin laden und den taliban aufh ren
1783390 quellen die auf anonymit t bestehen behaupten dass sich die kosovo protection brigades die der von der uno unterst tzten kpc nahe stehen bereits m rz 2000 in tetovo gostivar und skopje hauptquartiere geschaffen haben und ebensolche in debar und struga an der albanischen grenze mit bestimmten vorgaben vorbereitet

1783393 anzeichen daf r dass die bald stattfindenden anschl ge den anschl gen vom 11 september gleichkommen oder diese gar an h rte bertreffen werden und es ist ziemlich eindeutig dass dabei die hauptstadt und die stadt new york auf jeglicher liste stehen werden

1783396 der feind der uns am 11 september traf ist getroffen und schwach aber immer noch t dlich und immer noch bereit uns wieder zu treffen
1783397 ein neuer anschlag wie der am 11 september k nnte beides liefern eine rechtfertigung und eine m glichkeit vergeltungsschl ge gegen einige bekannte ziele durchzuf hren
1783398 ein terroristisches ereignis mit hoher schadenswirkung wird irgendwo in der westlichen welt geschehen vielleicht auch in den vereinigten staaten dieses wird unsere bev lkerung dazu bringen unsere verfassung in frage zu stellen und unser land zu militarisieren damit eine wiederholung eines weiteren todesopfer fordernden ereignisses verhindert wird
1783399 wir k nnten ein us amerikanisches schiff in guantanamo bay in die luft jagen und kuba die schuld daran in die schuhe schieben
1783400 wir k nnten eine kubanische kommunistische terrorkampagne in der gegend um miami und anderen st dten in florida oder sogar in washington organisieren
1783401 opferlisten in us amerikanischen tageszeitungen k nnten dazu beitragen in der bev lkerung eine nationale welle der emp rung loszutreten
1783402 um bei einem erneuten terroristischen angriff auf die usa wie dem vom 11 september gut ger stet zu sein

1783495 we want users to access the power of these innovations through as many channels as possible including mobile applications soft phone plug ins and carrier integration
1783496 todays announcement is the first step in making that possible
1783497 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
1783498 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
1783499 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
1783500 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
1783501 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

1783518 as a nation we face a crisis of wage theft
1783519 the wage and hour division is failing to protect workers from wage theft because of its woefully inadequate enforcement of the federal wage and hour laws

1783618 even while government and laws give security and well being to assemblages of men the sciences letters and arts which are less despotic but perhaps more powerful spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains that bind them stifle in them the sense of that original liberty for which they seemed to have been born make them love their enslavement and transform them into what are called civilized peoples

1783641 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1783642 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1783643 to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports guys go in there training for four years and putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal

1783647 the eu is very concerned by the violations of the rights of some of the people of the iranian province of kurdistan by the iranian authorities

1783655 china thinks that this 21st century is its century and theyre going to dominate it and this is their introducing china to the world
1783656 this is chinas chance to publicly expose a brand new country that is different than it used to be

1783667 governments are passing laws thinking they can legislate against the aids epidemic but these laws can do more harm than good
1783668 just like faulty condoms or unsafe medical supplies bad laws can spread the virus
1783669 criminal law is simply the wrong framework for dealing with hiv transmission
1783670 everywhere it has been tried it has been counterproductive and applied unjustly
1783671 it is a tragedy that laws criminalizing hiv transmission fly through parliaments while those against marital rape sit on the shelf
1783672 this is political expediency at its worst and most lethal
1783673 the law should guarantee access to hiv services not restrict it
1783674 whether its africa or the former soviet union working respectfully with people at risk of hiv rather than punishing them is the best way to fight the epidemic
1783675 hiv will never go away if countries continue passing laws that hinder much needed hiv prevention and treatment efforts
1783676 the commitment to ensure universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support means that governments must overcome legal barriers to access and protect vulnerable groups and the rights of people living with hiv
1783677 the punitive laws being enacted only undermine an effective response to hiv
1783678 the challenge is to use the law to protect the human rights of people living with or affected by hiv not to codify moral judgments against them

1783686 congressman davis believes that while some alabama voters both black and white would cast their votes based on race the overwhelming majority of voters are more open minded as he travels around the state he is increasingly convinced that alabamians are prepared to make a fair minded judgment on the governors race in 2010
1783687 congressman davis has demonstrated in his 6 years in the house that he can successfully work with his republican colleagues and even our states republican governor on a range of issues including support for domestic oil drilling and support for stronger enforcement of our immigration laws he has built a reputation in alabama as a thoughtful leader who puts our state ahead of party or ideology
1783688 we are not surprised that polling shows that congressman davis has a much better chance of winning alabama than our partys presidential candidate alabama voters have a history of voting for moderate to conservative democrats from bud cramer to james fields to sue bell cobb whom they get to see and touch in their own communities

1783721 as a result senior lenders blocked the companys interest payments to 85 million in junior loans held by another group of lenders thats because senior lenders who hold at least 295 million in loans want to preserve the companys cash for repayment of its own loans

1783849 while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america

1783854 nanowrimo changed the course of my life id been working on a novel with some vague aspiration of publishing for about six years the novel sucked it still does and i was often stuck and frustrated my online writing group imaginaries had these crazy people who would do this thing called nanowrimo and talked about how great it was except for in november when they were all stressed out about it i thought it might be fun to try and sort of planned on doing it but never followed through with it then in october of 2004 my brother then 12 was diagnosed with bone cancer and started chemotherapy id been telling him stories since he was a baby and he was the inspiration for several of them id always planned to write his favorite one into a novel someday i knew it would make a good kids book it suddenly hit me that if the cancer was fatal hed never read it writing my first novel was six years and counting my reason for doing nanowrimo was set and on november 1st 2004 i dug into my novel with a vengeance im sure it was hard although i dont remember it as such my characters came alive and although rough and full of problems a novel took shape under my typing fingers quickly somewhere in the midst of that story writing frenzy of my first nanowrimo i also finished off that first novel typing up the last bit of it seemed childs play next to the raw frenzy of getting an entire novel done i hit 50k with the book close to done writing the last 10k of it the first week in december but i had over 50k by the end of the month making dragon boy my first winning nanowrimo draft my brother read the book while in chemo and loved it marking it up rather seriously in red pen so that i could revise it his treatment was also successful and so i celebrated in 2005 by writing him a brand new novel that dealt with my feelings about his year of cancer i finished the book a week early proof that i was well on my way to becoming a nanowrimo regular the book moved him something i didnt think i was capable of doing to a thirteen year old kid and i knew then that id found what i wanted to do with my life become a childrens book author ive done and won nanowrimo every year since and while ive yet to snag an agent and the golden prize of publication i know that ive achieved what counts sharing the stories that mean so much to me with my brother hes still my biggest fan

1783863 welcome to the fishbowl in here we get a little bit too excited sometimes we get zealous about the bleeding edge we sometimes get tired of things before most of the rest of the internet has even found it and we often crave connections and meaning and value out of these shiny objects

1783969 from what ive heard the whole week is extremely long
1783970 youve got dinners every night not little dinners massive ones
1783971 as players thats the last thing we want we want to prepare ourselves youre just a slave that week
1783972 i feel hes done all the right things he called me right away and i told him i didnt take it personally
1783973 its an old argument that the pga of america has addressed i dont know who he talked to it doesnt even matter to me who he talked to but somebody from the past influenced him a little bit
1783974 youve got to give young people a break give anybody a break when they make a mistake

1783977 transformative journey to a sacred center full of hardships darkness and peril
1783978 self care is never a selfish act it is simply good stewardship of the only gift i have the gift i was put on earth to offer to others for a good man to realize that it is better to be whole than to be good is to enter on a strait and narrow path compared to which his previous rectitude was flowery license one dwells with god by being faithful to ones nature one crosses god by trying to be something one is not mystery surrounds every deep experience of the human heart the deeper we go into the hearts darkness or its light the closer we get to the ultimate mystery of god
1783979 go far enough on the inner journey and you end up not lost in narcissism but returning to the world bearing more gracefully the responsibilities that come with being human
1783980 each of us arrives here with a nature which means both limits and potentials we can learn as much about our nature by running into our limits as by experiencing our potentials
1783981 this hopeful notion that living is hidden within dying is surely enhanced by the visual glories of autumn
1783982 from what ive heard the whole week is extremely long
1783983 youve got dinners every night not little dinners but huge massive dinners i know as players thats the last thing we want to do
1783984 we want to prepare ourselves thats part of the whole thing youre just a slave that week
1783985 hes never been there its a lot of opinion for someone who has never been to the ryder cup
1783986 but i feel hes done all the right things he called me right away and i explained to him why i thought he was wrong
1783987 ive said all along im going to pick players who are hot so if hes hot hes going to get picked thats the way i look at it
1783988 if hes not then ill sidestep him i didnt take what he said personal but he was wrong and i think he realises the mistake hes only young and youve got to give young people a break once in a while
1783989 im two time defending and not being able to get out there and defend something ive already defended once and cant do it twice its a little bit frustrating
1783990 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundations

1783992 i consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or as it is called in biology homeostasis i e a tensionless state what man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal a freely chosen task the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him
1783993 in spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp it was possible for spiritual life to deepen sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain they were often of a delicate constitution but the damage to their inner selves was less they were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy make up often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust nature
1783994 one day a few days after the liberation i walked through the country past flowering meadows for miles and miles toward the market town near the camp

1783998 italian interior minister roberto maroni a member of the anti immigrant northern league party said last week fingerprinting was needed to fight crime and identify illegal immigrants
1783999 the campaign against roma camps an obsession of the berlusconi government will be their main priority

1784005 do the terms value added superior customer value or value chain make you want to throw something since you have heard the terms so much
1784006 the recent episode of recalled tomatoes provides yet more compelling lessons related to supply chain risk in the most vulnerable of supply chains that being food related an outbreak of salmonella type illness began to occur as early as april of this year on june 7 the u s food and drug administration fda warned consumers against eating certain types of raw tomatoes suspected of carrying the virulent saintpaul strain of salmonella the fda alerted consumers to avoid eating certain raw tomatoes red plum red roma and round red tomatoes while federal agencies searched for the root cause of this outbreak food chains and restaurants reacted to the ban by removing these products from store shelves and menus often including many more sources to insure that they would not be sued by consumers meanwhile tomato growers in florida california and mexico had significant trouble selling their crops with florida growers alone claiming up to 100 million in losses by mid july the u s center for disease control cdc and the fda were still attempting to determine a source of this outbreak and had determined that ill persons were more likely to have recently consumed raw tomatoes fresh jalapeno peppers and fresh cilantro since these items were commonly though not always consumed together no doubt we all tend to like mexican style cuisine by the end of july the cdc had definitively found the smoking gun tracing the outbreak to peppers grown on a farm in mexico earlier the fda had traced a contaminated jalapeno pepper to this same farm indicating the source to be the irrigation water supplying this farm both agencies issued a statement that consumers should not eat jalapeno and serrano peppers imported from mexico

1784013 were going to ship the initial drop of the rails plug in that we demonstrated at oscon as the first project in ironruby contrib
1784014 were doing this because much of the interesting projects that we work with for example rubyspec are all hosted on github already
1784015 we are going to migrate the ironruby sources to github soon traditionally we own or drive projects at microsoft we are rarely a participant in a project the work that we did to make these announcements helps to pave the way for other teams at microsoft to become participants in projects that are important to them and their customers

1784025 should we build applications in the product or should we allow it to be flexible and let users do it because we dont know what they will want
1784026 in no case do we say no this is the only way you can do it
1784027 simply using the product every day helped us develop key functionality

1784051 if you talk to sexual assault counselors youll most likely hear the low figure that 2 percent of all accusations of sexual assault reported to law enforcement across the country are later found to be false which the counselors say is the same rate as for other crimes allison and wrightsman simply chose the study that showed 2 percent the fbi has been saying since 1991 that the annual rate for the false reporting of forcible sexual assault across the country has been a consistent 8 percent through 1995 the most recent year available thats four times higher than the average of the false reporting rates of the other crimes tracked by the fbi in its uniform crime report the agencys guidelines define a report as false when an investigation determines that no offense occurred a complainants failure or refusal to cooperate in the investigation does not by itself lead to a finding of false report a low number would undercut a belief about rape as old as the story of joseph and potiphars wife that some women out of shame or vengeance or more recently the desire to circumvent restrictions on their ability to get or pay for an abortion claim that their consensual encounters or rebuffed advances were rapes if the number is high on the other hand advocates for women who have been raped worry it may also taint the credibility of the genuine victims of sexual assault yet the times may be changing and while some women still make false charges true rape victims dont seem to be feeling the backlash the clearest example of compelling motive can be found in the sexual allegation in divorce s a i d syndrome in such cases questionable allegations multiply because the accuser has far more to gain than to lose simply charging a divorcing spouse with child molestation or wife battering or spousal rape can turn a hot but evenly balanced custody battle into a rout
1784052 the whole effort at reforming rape laws has been an attack on the premise that women who bring complaints are suspect
1784053 with the cooperation of the police agency of a small metropolitan community 45 consecutive disposed false rape allegations covering a 9 year period were studied these false rape allegations constitute 41 the total forcible rape cases n 109 reported during this period these false allegations appear to serve three major functions for the complainants providing an alibi seeking revenge and obtaining sympathy and attention false rape allegations are not the consequence of a gender linked aberration as frequently claimed but reflect impulsive and desperate efforts to cope with personal and social stress situations
1784054 all too often however feminist rhetoric merely replaced the old stereotypes that viewed most rape complainants as scorned women or sex crazed neurotics with an equally simplistic clich
1784055 feminism is built on believing womens accounts of sexual use and abuse by men
1784056 in 1985 a study of 556 rape allegations found that 27 accusers recanted when faced with a polygraph which can be ordered in the military and independent evaluation showed a false accusation rate of 60
1784057 an editorial in the new york post on the now infamous oliver jovanovic false report case dunleavy 1999 quoted district attorney linda farstein from an interview in penthouse magazine where she stated

1784218 no multipliques palabras altaneras cesen en vuestra boca las palabras insolentes porque jehov es un dios de todo saber por l son examinadas todas las acciones los arcos de los fuertes son quebrados pero los que tropiezan se ci en de poder
1784219 gloria desaparecida aqu israel llega a uno de sus estados m s bajo de toda su historia nacional
1784220 entonces todos los ancianos de israel se reunieron y fueron a samuel en ram y le dijeron he aqu que t has envejecido y tus hijos no andan en tus caminos por eso constit yenos ahora un rey que nos gobierne como tienen todas las naciones
1784221 y jehov le dijo escucha la voz del pueblo en todo lo que te diga porque no es a ti a quien han desechado es a m a quien han desechado para que no reine sobre ellos de la misma manera que han hecho conmigo desde el d a en que los saqu de egipto hasta el d a de hoy abandon ndome y sirviendo a otros dioses as hacen conmigo tambi n ahora pues escucha su voz pero advi rteles solemnemente y decl rales cu l ser el proceder del rey que ha de reinar sobre ellos

1784224 querido pap sigo queriendo los patines con las ruedas en l nea
1784225 papa me compras los patines con las ruedas en l nea
1784226 cuando quiero que dios me d algo y me da la impresi n de que no est dispuesto a darme lo que le estoy pidiendo a gritos el esp ritu me recuerda
1784227 vayamos y preguntemos al hombre de dios que vive aqu d nde est n los burros
1784228 acaso el hijo de quis es tambi n uno de los profetas
1784229 sal en busca de los burros y me encontr con samuel y me dijo que los burros estaban a salvo en casa
1784230 se ha ocultado entre los equipajes y all fue donde le encontraron
1784231 bueno te he estado esperando pero cuando vi que los hombres regresaban a sus casas pens que deb a hacer algo de modo que finalmente me obligu a mi mismo a ofrecer el holocausto
1784232 pero ahora tu reino no ser duradero jehov se ha buscado un hombre seg n su coraz n a quien jehov ha designado como el soberano de su pueblo porque t no has guardado lo que jehov te mand
1784233 samuel dijo a sa l jehov me envi para ungirte como rey de su pueblo israel escucha pues ahora las palabras de jehov as ha dicho jehov de los ej rcitos yo castigar a amalec por lo que hizo a israel porque se le opuso en el camino cuando sub a a egipto ve ahora y ataca a amalec destruye completamente todo lo que le pertenece no le perdones la vida mata a hombres y mujeres a ni os y a beb s vacas y ovejas camellos y asnos
1784234 por cuanto alz su mano contra el trono de jehov jehov tendr guerra contra amalec de generaci n en generaci n exo 17 16 y a sa l le fue dada esta remisi n que cumplir pero la cumpli
1784235 y sa l derrot a los amalequitas desde havila hasta las inmediaciones de shur al este de egipto captur vivo a agag rey de amalec y destruy a filo de espada a todo el pueblo sin embargo sa l y el pueblo perdonaron la vida a agag a lo mejor de las ovejas y de las vacas y de los animales engordados de los carneros y de todo lo bueno lo cual no quisieron destruir pero destruyeron todo lo despreciable y sin valor
1784236 por qu hemos de destruir a estos animales que son perfectamente buenos
1784237 despojarnos de la antigua naturaleza con sus pr cticas como son los celos la perversidad la amargura la envidia la ira la intemperancia el ego smo y todas estas cosas
1784238 vale la pena conservar algunas de estas cosas dif cilmente puedo ser una verdadera personalidad si no conservo un genio vivo y si de vez en cuando no puedo reprender a la gente de modo que pretendemos hallar el bien en aquello que dios ha declarado malo
1784239 bueno es cierto que he salvado la vida a unos pocos pens que a dios le complacer a si se los dedicaba a l esta es una excusa que usamos no es cierto lo que deseamos conservar pretendemos dedic rselo a dios y fue la misma treta que tambi n us sa l
1784240 samuel dijo aunque eres insignificante ante tus propios ojos no fuiste hecho cabeza de las tribus de israel no te ha ungido jehov como rey sobre israel jehov te ha encomendado una misi n y te ha dicho ve y destruye completamente a estos pecadores de amalec hazles la guerra hasta que los extermines por qu pues no has obedecido la voz de jehov por qu te lanzaste sobre el bot n e hiciste lo malo ante los ojos de jehov se complace tanto jehov en los holocaustos y los sacrificios como en que la palabra de jehov sea obedecida ciertamente el obedecer es mejor que el sebo de los carneros porque la rebeld a es como el pecado de adivinaci n y la obstinaci n es como la iniquidad de la idolatr a por cuanto t has desechado la palabra de jehov l tambi n te ha desechado a ti para que no seas rey
1784241 este no es el que yo he escogido finalmente apareci el m s joven que era el m s enjuto que se llamaba david y dios puso su sello sobre l dios no hab a basado su elecci n en el aspecto exterior sino que hab a mirado el coraz n del joven
1784242 jehov es mi pastor nada me faltar en prados de tiernos pastos me hace descansar junto a aguas tranquilas me conduce confortar mi alma salmos 23 1 3a
1784243 qui n es este filisteo incircunciso para que desaf e a los escuadrones del dios viviente 17 26 ese es siempre el punto de vista de la fe que no se deja estremecer por las circunstancias
1784244 nunca se me hab a metido nada semejante en la mente
1784245 pero como en aquel tiempo el que fue engendrado seg n la carne persegu a al que hab a nacido seg n el esp ritu as es ahora tambi n
1784246 porque la carne desea lo que es contrario al esp ritu y el esp ritu lo que es contrario a la carne para que no hag is lo que quisierais

1784266 the undeniable truth is this successful open source software projects tend to be at the developer level not the end user level e g successful open source projects have programming interfaces not user interfaces apache perl python gcc php the various sql databases the list of fantastic open source developer software is long the list of fantastic open source gui software is short this is not a function of chance the open source revolution has done nothing to change the fact that the best designed most intuitive user interfaces are found in closed source commercial software

1784279 in my opinion the real king of bollywood is amitabh bachchan
1784280 he has been in the industry for the last 40 years while we have been here for 15 years only to become a king you dont need money and power you must have positive energy and mr bachchan has that
1784281 if a controversy erupts from my statement i dont mind i really feel he is the king of our industry

1784288 hes got a one off test against us so hell be hugely motivated hell be excited nervous and have a lot of energy but whatever you do in this game as captain its about sustaining it afterwards he wont experience too many of the pressures of captaincy right now but hell really start to understand it in a few months time running a team and getting a team to play for you its going to be interesting
1784289 i think theres a mutual respect in terms of performance thats probably as far as it goes
1784290 its going to be interesting now hes been thrown a lot of curveballs around him
1784291 as captain you have to have an open mind you have to arrive at a stadium where so many different things challenge you from day to day and its not only about your performance
1784292 one thing i will say is that captaincy will make him think about that now
1784293 i think you bump your head a lot as captain
1784294 i certainly bumped my head a few times as a young guy but its how you face up to that do you look at it with an open mind learn for yourself and take the lessons on board those will be the important things for him he might have a good run of it but when you bump your head for the first time how do you reassess and where do you go from there
1784295 there was a period of time when i took a balls to the wall sort of approach when i was going to put everything into my batting and expect the same from the team
1784296 its also about where his team is and where he wants to take them
1784297 as a captain when you ask a lot of your players youve got to walk the walk also and its not always possible to achieve those performances he has some massive challenges ahead of him coming up and he doesnt have too many easy options ahead either

1784320 varda quella povera mula scarpe con tacchi alti e adesso non la pol neanche camminar ben
1784321 mi a voi non ve capisso non pod usar scarpe de ginnastica
1784322 eh ma quando te son vesti per uscir la sera te se devi gaver scarpe adatte
1784323 se vedi che a voi mule ve piasi le robe dolorose
1784324 ye have heard that it was said by them of old
1784325 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
1784326 and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
1784327 20 for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven
1784328 1 then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples 2 saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat 3 all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not 4 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
1784329 5 but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments 6 and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues 7 and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
1784330 23 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone 24 ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
1784331 13 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon 14 and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him 15 and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
1784332 45 then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him 46 the officers answered never man spake like this man 47 then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived 48 have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him 49 but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed 50 nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them 51 doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth 52 they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet
1784333 38 and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus 39 and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight 40 then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury 41 now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid 42 there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
1784334 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
1784335 1 take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
1784336 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
1784337 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
1784338 14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him 15 if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food 16 and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit 17 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
1784339 18 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
1784340 22 for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad
1784341 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
1784342 9 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son
1784343 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever
1784344 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
1784345 13 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me

1784397 you dont need to have a gun the police will protect you

1784453 i have really sharpened my reporting and writing skills since ive been here and i think ive become a much more resourceful person in terms of making a story better
1784454 i think thats more valuable than any clips i can get while im here
1784455 fantastic events the great people and all the tools that are available to us
1784456 the idea behind the internships is that science is increasingly global the performers are increasing global but the science journalism community is not representative of that increasing global participation
1784457 what makes this different is that were trying to tap into the journalism community at the undergraduate level to reach people committed to being journalists and say hey have you ever thought about doing science writing
1784458 i dont think that minority students tend to think of science journalism as a career
1784459 with a lot of my friends theyre looking for a moneymaker as an undergraduate thinking about what they can do to help out their family
1784460 but i feel like they do loosen up and show their personalities
1784461 they dont talk over my head and i enjoy the experience
1784462 i really thought i found my niche in science reporting and i wanted to explore it more with this internship
1784463 without considering other avenues you dont have to work in a lab or company you could also go out and write and report on it
1784464 kind of an eye opener a lot of the articles here are sort of previews of whats happening in industry and government what happens in the grant process what kinds of scandals are happening with peer review i saw a lot more aspects of science journalism
1784465 we try to make it fun but we dont dumb it down we dont pretend that its not challenging
1784466 were interested in people who find that challenge exciting and well give them all the support that they need with the resources we have here at aaas
1784467 im at the point where im thinking do i pursue a career in the sciences or do i go into journalism which is something i fell in love with
1784468 when i find a job ill pitch these stories independently and maybe get a foot in the back door that way rather than being the official science writer

1784470 eight years ago god by his spirit moved the church in america to pray it made a difference in our national life in this present year of political campaigning the church needs to be on its knees i want to encourage you to be there as you are able thecall to the mall lets pray for our land and god will answer us

1784473 i believe august 16th will be a significant day in the history of our nation as hundreds of thousands gather to the mall in washington dc for prayer and fasting believing that god can turn our nation back to him
1784474 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
1784475 it is an offense to our rational truth revealing god it is an offense to the true work of his son it is an offense to the true work of the holy spirit to use the names of god or of christ or of the holy spirit in any mindless emotional orgy marked by irrational sensual and fleshly behavior produced by altered states of consciousness peer pressure heightened expectation or suggestibility that is socio psycho manipulation and mesmerizm and it is a prostitution of the glorious revelation of god taught clearly and powerfully to an eager attentive and controlled mind what feeds sensual desires pragmatically or ecstatically cannot honor god you have to preach the truth to the mind

1784493 despite the fact that there is still massive demand for condo hotels from the buying public the mortgage market is actually making it more difficult for people to buy condo hotels
1784494 we do have people calling us up who are attempting to close on pre construction properties that they bought a year or two ago theyre telling us that due to the more restrictive mortgage conditions that have arisen they are having trouble getting qualified for a loan even though they were easily pre qualified when they made the initial purchase now if they cant get funding and arent able to close on the property they risk losing the initial deposit they put down when they purchased for some buyers this can equate to a six figure loss
1784495 the hotel is nearing completion and the past purchasers are now having to deal with closing on the property
1784496 weve been speaking with the primary lenders on the hard rock throughout the closing process by all accounts the numbers of persons who have had trouble closing on their properties are in the single digits
1784497 condo hotel projects will continue to flourish and you can fully expect to see more coming online in the coming year
1784498 this correction in the mortgage sector is a natural and needed occurrence and will only benefit the condo hotel market long term it ensures that only qualified buyers make purchases and it will minimize the number of purchasers who default on loans

1784512 this market will turn around and when it does i need quality people that is why we win awards
1784513 i think people have a sense that prices feel fair again
1784514 it is a way to bring on our new product
1784515 you can continue to build the same homes and continue to cut prices and undermine your own prices or bring something fresh and exciting
1784516 even as successful as the honda accord is they update it every few years
1784517 it is much easier to stick with what you have but i think there are huge opportunities right now one of the benefits of being a private company is that you can move faster
1784518 this is not one builder undercutting everyone even if we dont lower our prices people are selling at lower prices we are very careful not to lead the market in price cuts
1784519 we are cutting prices as low as we can and this is the best price we ever offered but i can tell you that after the sale is over prices are going to go back up
1784520 i am most concerned by the execution of mexican national jos medellin yesterday in texas mr medellin was not informed of his right to consular help at the time of his arrest even though the united states are legally bound to guarantee this right under the 1963 vienna convention on consular relations this is a regrettable attitude by a country which is very vocal about its commitment to the rule of law the judicial authorities also blatantly ignored the order by the international court of justice to stay the execution on the grounds of the violation of the right to consular assistance i wrote to the texas board of pardons and paroles in july asking for a stay of the execution but my appeal has been disregarded in the same way as the calls from the mexican government the un secretary general and several other governments and international organisations the issue at stake is not the guilt of mr medellin he was found guilty of a particularly gruesome crime and he deserved to be punished the problem is the death penalty which is rejected by a great majority of democratic and civilised countries across the world and also the pick and choose attitude of the united states of america and its individual states when it comes to respecting international law the execution of mr medellin was therefore not only a violation of human rights and human dignity but also an act of arrogant defiance which undermines the collective mechanisms for peace and security in the world

1784541 we you started to say i i think you knew what town you were in and decided to jump for it
1784542 that doesnt change the fact we had no idea we were coming here in the first place the only reason you caught us was pure dumb luck
1784543 you saw a chance to reach out to michelle and you went for it
1784544 maybe i did make the decision to jump here it didnt change the fact she hated me when i got here and now im more pissed at bob than i ever have been and youre only here by some weird twist of luck
1784545 first off it was a total hunch dont underestimate a womans hunch again second bob thought he was doing the right thing

1784549 gerrard and i took the information for our boss and then he ran away with it when i find it it will be the equivalent of you getting that letter its my closure

1784564 oh yes i heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room
1784565 i conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to watsons bay
1784566 i think that the caller was a member of the jury

1784601 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1784602 while accusations of this magnitude should always be met with skepticism one only needs to look back to the gulf of tonkin incident to realize that such tactics of deception have been employed before to start a war in fact as seymour hersh recently uncovered the bush administration was planning similar smoke and mirrors options for iran
1784603 the u s was thinking of flying u2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over iraq painted in u n colours
1784604 if saddam fired on them he would be in breach
1784605 foxs bill oreilly on the oreilly factor talking about details of the story and exhorting
1784606 as you know some former government officials and perhaps some within the government are saying there are some strong signs that the iraqis were connected to the september 11 terrorist attack specifically the meetings in prague between mohammed atta the suspected ringleader and iraqi intelligence an iraqi intelligence agent as far as youre concerned was there a connection there
1784607 its been pretty well confirmed that mohamed atta did go to prague and he did meet with a senior official of the iraqi intelligence service in czechoslovakia last april several months before the attack
1784608 czech police said yesterday they had no evidence that the ringleader of the suicide attacks mohammed atta met an iraqi intelligence agent in prague earlier this year
1784609 jiri kolar the police chief said there were no documents showing that atta visited prague at any time this year
1784610 evidence of a meeting in prague between a senior iraqi intelligence agent and mohamed atta the sept 11 ringleader is convincing
1784611 the czech president vaclav havel has quietly told the white house he has concluded that there is no evidence to confirm earlier reports that mohamed atta the leader in the sept
1784612 for months american intelligence and law enforcement officials have cast doubt on the reports of the prague meeting which proved to be based on the statements of a single informant and last week the director of central intelligence george j tenet told congress that his agency could find no evidence to confirm that the meeting took place
1784613 in the rehearsal and discussion sessions at langley cia headquarters the give and take was mostly the secretary of state trying to eliminate unsubstantiated and or unhelpful material and others from the white house trying to keep that material in or add more
1784614 last week congressional investigators declared in their major report on the terrorist attacks of sept
1784615 the cia had proof that iraqi guy was not in prague at the time said the official who asked not to be named
1784616 with respect to 9 11 of course weve had the story thats been public out there the czechs alleged that mohamed atta the lead attacker met in prague with a senior iraqi intelligence official five months before the attack but weve never been able to develop any more of that yet either in terms of confirming it or discrediting it we just dont know
1784617 fbi records show atta and fellow hijacker marwan al shehhi checking out of the diplomat inn in virginia beach va and writing a check for cash for 8 000 for a suntrust account in that city on april 4 2001 for the rest of that week attas cell phone was used to make repeated calls to florida on april 11 atta rented an apartment in coral springs fla while acknowledging that a few days are unaccounted for the fbi has found no evidence that atta departed the country overseas during this period an official said
1784618 newsweek has learned that a few months ago the czechs quietly acknowledged that they may have been mistaken about the whole thing atta allegedly meeting with an iraqi agent in prague

1784622 a series of letters between iraqi agents and officials in the central african nation of niger
1784623 made relatively crude errors that eventually gave them away including names and titles that did not match up with the individuals who held office at the time the letters were purportedly written
1784624 its not fair to accuse the analysts for what others say about our material
1784625 reported to the cia and state department that the information was unequivocally wrong and that the documents had been forged
1784626 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
1784627 we know hes been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons and we believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons 17
1784628 sought several times to determine the basis for the assessment and whether it was based on independent evidence not otherwise available to the u s

1784638 those are very big steps to take and they have a lot of repercussions
1784639 so thats generally the reason why cities are reluctant to do that type of thing
1784640 despite the housing market slowdown las vegas is continuing to grow at a rate that is the envy of other communities
1784641 the valleys economy remains relatively strong which should help our real estate market weather the current correction that being said we should all now understand that we are not immune to the laws of the market and economics

1784646 the architecturally significant design and meticulous attention to detail in lumina tempe is what makes the development exceptionally different
1784647 the entire lumina brand strives to reinvent the way people live and the way guests authentically experience a destination by stimulating an integrative lifestyle and tapping into aesthetic sensibilities we infuse that philosophy in every aspect of the development
1784648 building urban style housing in a traditionally suburban area is a development whose time has now come
1784649 the community is ready for the architecture and lifestyle offerings associated with loft style living this trend setting project is an ideal neighborhood for our emerging urban core of summerlin centre poised to become the downtown of summerlin
1784650 were seeing a growing demand for more urban style housing offerings right here in las vegas
1784651 loft style housing typically caters to homeowners who want to be in the center of everything and c2 lofts is well positioned to be in the heart of the action in summerlin
1784652 there isnt a better place for c2 lofts than summerlin
1784653 they want to go into a look theyre familiar with
1784654 in california newport beach has a certain cachet a certain eclectic surf culture and art culture so theres a cachet that comes with newport that southern californians instantly recognize
1784655 we did not go with one line because we want the best of each appliance
1784656 you get a subzero fridge wolf microwave bosch dishwasher and kitchenaid gas range not to mention kohler sinks and tubs dormbracht fixtures and lbl lighting it really doesnt get much better
1784657 we used to build office warehouse in new zealand and people would come up and say whats the possibility for residential we held out for so long but the demand was too strong
1784658 theyre in a 2 100 square foot unit from 9 to 5 and when youre finished at the end of the day you dont go back to a 1 000 square foot apartment you still have 2 100 square feet its something you can use 24 hours a day
1784659 this is going to be amazing when were done with it
1784660 in south beach i bought a lot of abandoned buildings renovated them and rebranded them as sophisticated boutique hotels
1784661 once theres some more clubs and restaurants some good shopping it is going to take off
1784662 i did and i did say wait a minute am i crazy
1784663 it was a friday happy hour and all these professional people city workers lawyers were there it was a real upscale new york type atmosphere and i was sold
1784664 there probably hasnt been a celebrity photographed down here since frank sinatra
1784665 but you wait and see in the next few years youll start seeing so and so downtown then everyone will want to get in here
1784666 i think this area is hitting on a subculture that does not want to be part of the strip
1784667 its a downtown that wants to have a pub crawl they want to get away from the glitter and glamour and get down to the basics
1784668 we have six attorneys two doctors a dentist the director of alcohol sales for a major casino a local bar owner a teacher
1784669 they are people who want to live closer to work a few who live here monday through friday
1784670 the same thing that happened in dallas will happen here
1784671 we built these in dallas in areas with real sketchy neighbors now you cant touch the property around those projects theyre surrounded with new development
1784672 i have so much more faith in this than any part of dallas we built in im looking forward to whats going to happen here
1784673 the whole theory behind redevelopment is that you catalyze an area and hope it has influence beyond that
1784674 at the end of the day you want the private sector to do most of the heavy lifting
1784675 because that too was a really old blighted district now they had great architecture in those old buildings but i would say thats a great case study for the kind of catalytic impact we hope will happen here
1784676 c2 lofts is the first authentic loft development in summerlin and also in las vegas
1784677 the feedback we are receiving from our first residents is phenomenal
1784678 these 36 acres will comprise a complete living environment where loft owners will be able to truly live work and play within what is now becoming the urban center of summerlin
1784679 our grand opening presents an opportunity for prospective buyers to get in on the ground floor of a lifestyle that is completely new to the las vegas area
1784680 the loft owners in our first completed building will come home to serene surroundings featuring an open air courtyard with a zen like water feature a bamboo garden and landscaping throughout the beautiful interior courtyard
1784681 for intimate or large gatherings residents will have exclusive use of the furnished roof garden with a fire pit fireplace wet bar and panoramic views of the las vegas skyline
1784682 another appealing amenity is our planned dog park which will provide a place for our residents to take their best friend out for some exercise and meet new friends as well
1784683 hey remember that guy jerry mccardy that you beat up in high school

1784688 listen im in the middle of something can i call you later
1784689 is that all you got cant you do any better than that
1784690 very long list of questions that reflect why i like to read the king james bible
1784691 well precious what story would you like me to tell you
1784692 the first time i transformed into a werewolf i was taking a shower i had been visiting my parents in tucson for the weekend they had gone shopping for a few hours and i was scheduled to attend a party thrown by some friends who attend the university of arizona i had just washed the shampoo out of my hair when i began to feel extremely uncomfortable all over my body i knew it wasnt a flare up of my irritable bowel syndrome because i didnt really feel sick in my stomach what i felt was more of an intense pain shooting through my muscles my skin felt like it was stretching because it was i could hear my muscles and bones popping my very skeletal structure rearranging itself into something not human yet not entirely animal the lower part of my face jutted painfully forward as my teeth elongated into canine fangs my lips curling back in a sardonic rictus of pure feral savagery
1784693 a werewolf thats the best you could come up with
1784694 in your world really means however everyone knows this go on
1784695 i mean come on a werewolf in the shower how michael j fox is that
1784696 okay granted i was just trying to avoid the usual werewolf clich s ya know give me some credit for that at least
1784697 no can do its not a concept that easily lends itself to contemporary application
1784698 sure it can be given contemporary application what about the howling an american werewolf in london underworld for fucks sake
1784699 just let it go tell me again why i keep you around
1784700 maybe because i dont stroke your precious little ego with all that bullshit about you being the next hemingway or something
1784701 actually i think its more because you have great tits
1784702 i thought i was going to be stuck with you all day
1784703 i was gonna go shopping with stephanie and dawn but i guess i can do that another time
1784704 well i truly and sincerely appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to comport yourself public wise with the likes of me

1784709 now its your turn to tell me why i keep you around
1784710 it cant be because i have great tits can it
1784711 hardly you could do with a few more visits to the gym actually
1784712 you didnt say that when we were in bed together
1784713 whatever we were both drunk and horny and we said wed never make that mistake again
1784714 you say the word whatever to me one more time and ill stab you with this knife
1784715 what shit would you suggest i put into my body
1784716 that stuff what did they put in that thing the peppers carrots and green onions i can see but whats that yellow shit
1784717 next time try harder at least its better than that piece of carcass youre pounding down you do know thatll give you stomach cancer right
1784718 it tastes good you should try some best tasting stomach cancer youll ever get i guarantee it
1784719 why must you find fault in every fucking thing i do thats not how friends are supposed to treat each other yknow
1784720 lighten up mr crankypants im only kidding god youre sensitive
1784721 you dont even realize you do it and its beginning to get real old real quick
1784722 well thats just the way i am and im not gonna change for you or anyone else take it or leave it
1784723 well i guess thats that ill see you around then
1784724 i told you not to say that word i gave you fair warning but you wouldnt listen now look at you you stupid insensitive bitch
1784725 youre not my father and i dont have to listen to anyone especially your ugly ass
1784726 i guess the woman who took all the other machines hasnt come back yet
1784727 yeah some mexican chick she came in earlier and filled up all of em with her shit told me not to touch any of it real bitch

1784729 serve her right if someone pulled out her stuff and left em out on the table huh
1784730 but i dont want any trouble from her those latinas are all the same

1784732 come on i just need one would it be too much to ask
1784733 whats with the attitude im just asking you a question
1784734 dont you think its just a bit inconsiderate and selfish to hog all the machines when you clearly have stuff that can be combined into one machine is that how you would want your neighbor to treat you
1784735 youre not my father and you dont tell me what to do
1784736 im not telling you what to do im asking you a question
1784737 why dont you just go back and read your stupid little book and mind your own business
1784738 actually thats all youve been saying since you opened your mouth
1784739 but remember theres another person who needs a dryer too what about him
1784740 what about him he can fight with you over who gets it
1784741 yeah well ill be done soon so i wont have to deal with your ugly ass so
1784742 and you better not touch any of my stuff or ill tell the manager
1784743 then i can let her know how you hogged up all the machines and made other residents wait for you to finish when you could have been considerate and shared the place with your neighbors
1784744 sweetheart i have no desire whatsoever to touch anything of yours believe me
1784745 its a whole lot better than what i was thinking of calling you
1784746 think i will you might want to try it some time reading i mean you do know how dont you
1784747 you wanna say to me what you said to her ese
1784748 not really what i said to her was between me and her what did she tell you i said
1784749 whatsamatter you gonna deny you said shit to me motherfucker
1784750 this is how shes been talking to me since this whole thing started i never used language like that to her she was the one who had to start with the personal insults i only asked her to leave me a dryer
1784751 go on tell him what you told me big maaaaan
1784752 i said several things to you what thing in particular did i say to you that you had to involve your man
1784753 oh yeah deny that you told me to fuck off why dont you
1784754 youre a liar lady you were the one who told me to go fuck myself along with calling me ugly and a whole lot of other shit when all i did was ask you if you didnt think it was inconsiderate to hog all the machines
1784755 thats what i told her now is all this really necessary i have no beef with you but if you want trouble i can have the cops down here and we can let them sort things out
1784756 look i dont want any trouble with you either just stay away from my wife okay
1784757 i dont need this shit i wish you would just keep your mouth shut when you go out im sick of having to get in every motherfuckers face when you get into shit like this
1784758 we got off on the wrong foot okay lets all just calm down and get our laundry done and hopefully well never see each other again sound good to you
1784759 what the fuck youre just gonna let this pendejo talk to me however the fuck he wants what kind of man are you cant even stand up for his woman what the fucks all that muscle for are you turning faggot on me kick his ass
1784760 would you be happy if he apologized to you would that shut you up
1784761 excuse me but who the hell are you that you can be mean to people and tell lies and then have your man punch out people for you what the fucks up with that
1784762 listen i said i dont want any trouble and i meant it and i believe you when you say you dont want any trouble i can understand your wanting to protect your woman id do the same thing if i had a woman of my own but shes lying to you here im done trying to explain things to someone whos obviously looking for trouble
1784763 you shouldnt have done that ese now i gotta come down on you
1784764 he likes you you can pick him up if you want he wont bite you dont be afraid
1784765 oh im not afraid of him im allergic to him all animals actually thanks though but ill pass
1784766 you were pretty close to that rabbit before and you didnt sneeze
1784767 you saw that huh im not too bad if i keep my distance i just cant touch em i do like animals though
1784768 whatever pookies a nice puppy you should be more friendly to pookie

1784794 indian art is at least 200 000 years old which is an educated guess and it could be much more this is of great cultural significance to india and to the world
1784795 it is time india asserted itself and took pride in the enormous history of the lower palaeolithic culture which has now been proved to be among the oldest in the world rivalling africa southwestern europe and eastern asia
1784796 while africa may be the cradle of the hominid evolution southern asia is more likely to be the main theatre of initial development of modern human cognition self awareness and technological competence
1784797 indians probably dont realise the significance of these ancient paintings they need to understand what it means in terms of national identity like the french who have the importance of art ingrained in their psyche and preserve it
1784798 asi has been focused on the indus valley and mughal periods but there has to be an understanding in decision making circles that india has much more that that
1784799 one way of doing this is by teaching rock art science as a specialised course in universities
1784800 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight that way the offshore drilling carries us until new technologies kick in which will carry us to energy independence
1784801 mama you have to come and see this its a walking stick bug
1784802 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
1784803 for their crime will they escape in wrath cast down the peoples o god
1784804 so whatever you wish that others would do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
1784805 enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is easy
1784806 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
1784807 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven
1784808 everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
1784809 capsaicin stimulates uncoupled atp hydrolysis by sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump
1784810 cloudav virtualizes and parallelizes detection functionality with multiple antivirus engines significantly increasing overall protection
1784811 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state
1784812 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1784813 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1784814 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1784815 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
1784816 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
1784817 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
1784818 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
1784819 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
1784820 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1784821 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1784822 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1784823 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1784824 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1784825 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1784826 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1784827 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1784828 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
1784829 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
1784830 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
1784831 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
1784832 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
1784833 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction
1784834 some heart failure patients spend a lot of time in and out of the hospital due to chest pain and trouble breathing
1784835 at any time such as when the subject is beginning to feel poorly we immediately get readings of pulmonary pressure we are hopeful we can avoid a hospitalization by adjusting the subjects medication based on the pressure recording as we evaluate the cardiomems wireless pressure monitoring system we see great potential to increase convenience to patients and hospital efficiency by cutting back on frequent trips to the emergency room
1784836 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
1784837 it might be possible to find a pan flavivirus target
1784838 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1784839 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1784840 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1784841 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1784842 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1784843 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1784844 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1784845 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
1784846 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
1784847 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
1784848 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1784849 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1784850 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1784851 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1784852 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1784853 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1784854 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies
1784855 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1784856 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1784857 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1784858 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1784859 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1784860 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
1784861 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
1784862 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
1784863 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
1784864 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
1784865 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems
1784866 while you were sleeping implementing a sleep apnea screening protocol
1784867 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
1784868 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
1784869 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics
1784870 the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics

1784896 its escapism certainly in a time with a lot of bad news out there i think people are having fun with it ive never had a show that more people in the business want to participate in wanting to go out to the set and try to do it
1784897 we have found if its the redevelopment agency sometimes not always property owners just see dollar signs
1784898 part of the complexity is the 60 foot elevation drop in the property
1784899 thats why we have so many great views we knew thered be challenges everything turns out to be more than anticipated but overall the project is looking like we wanted it to
1784900 i was originally referred to bella vista by a current resident
1784901 i was living in a single family home in anthem country club when my friend told me about bella vista once i visited the property with its beautiful landscaping pools and spa and its close proximity to the district i knew bella vista would be my next home this is a great community to live in in fact ive referred several other buyers to bella vista as well
1784902 bella vista has a nice fitness center overlooking one of the pools so its a nice place to train and work out
1784903 the surrounding trails and roads are great for runners additionally the trail system makes a perfect 5 mile loop which is great for training
1784904 working in residential real estate i know the market quite well
1784905 with the amenities on property the surrounding community quick access to i 215 and the great prices and incentive packages now is the time to buy a condo at bella vista
1784906 our percentage of investors is substantially less than other projects because we had a hold back period in the contract from day one
1784907 theres so many condo owners trying to figure out what to do with their property theyre on the phone to us all day its a very hot topic
1784908 theres huge demand for corporate housing in las vegas not like san francisco but its a big market and people want to know what to do with their condo
1784909 if they furnish it they can turn it into a hotel alternative
1784910 the luxury condominium market continues to evolve and respond to the latest market conditions
1784911 land owners and developers are dealing with conservative reactions by the investment community and potential buyers in response to recent reports that a supply demand imbalance is inevitable
1784912 we still think itll take nine to 12 months to absorb the luxury condos coming on the market meanwhile prices are escalating in the future youll never see 600 a square foot again
1784913 people are saying im not sure what to do with it
1784914 one couple from tucson ariz bought in sky and were going to rent it out now theyve put their unit at metropolis up for sale and theyre going to keep sky to live in
1784915 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
1784916 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
1784917 i still read the newspaper to find out what corporate media has decided to tell us

1784931 het is voor het eerst dat radiolympia live vanaf de spelen komt bewust proberen we de ontspannen zomersfeer van radio tour de france door te trekken met veel muziek en de vertrouwde radiostemmen van jurgen van den berg en tom van t hek ik verwacht veel van de wisselwerking met nos studio sportzomer dat vanaf het bovengelegen dakterras wordt uitgezonden je weet van elkaar wat je doet en voorkomt daarmee dubbel werk daarnaast kunnen gasten over en weer aanschuiven daar moet je niet krampachtig over doen

1784944 the luxury condominium market continues to evolve and respond to the latest market conditions
1784945 land owners and developers are dealing with conservative reactions by the investment community and potential buyers in response to recent reports that a supply demand imbalance is inevitable
1784946 we still think itll take nine to 12 months to absorb the luxury condos coming on the market meanwhile prices are escalating in the future youll never see 600 a square foot again
1784947 people are saying im not sure what to do with it
1784948 one couple from tucson ariz bought in sky and were going to rent it out now theyve put their unit at metropolis up for sale and theyre going to keep sky to live in

1784959 one couple from tucson ariz bought in sky and were going to rent it out now theyve put their unit at metropolis up for sale and theyre going to keep sky to live in
1784960 a large share of the 36 projects are at best trying to regain their footing and at worst remain on life support because of high construction costs poor management and location lack of experience lack of financing or a combination
1784961 it is no different than single family there are not as many buyers in the market if you are the seller more flexibility is the key
1784962 while we have a dramatic slowdown in interest to these projects and the velocity of reservations and sales contracts have dropped compared to activity in 2004 and 2005 high density projects will be an integral part of our urban landscape
1784963 but it will sell at a more measured and sustainable pace because of their scale and amenity offerings
1784964 this project is more than 18 months behind schedule there is no construction above the first floor of the first tower and the sad truth is even that floor is not substantially completed
1784965 the project had impressive presales but now our clients have heard every excuse for delaying the return of their more than 600 000 in cash construction ceased long ago and we have learned there is no financing in place to move the project along
1784966 we remain hesitant to call for an economic downturn believing instead that we are moving sideways under a yellow caution flag
1784967 in short current conditions remain far brighter than in the aftermath of 9 11 and less optimistic than the steady growth observed through 2004 and 2005
1784968 i think many of these categories will remain robust through 2007 although retail and office construction are vulnerable to a slowdown
1784969 one of the things you need to remember is that there can a big difference when youre comparing condo hotel and pure condominium sales
1784970 hey we cheered man loudest in this way contemporaneousness we reidentify the irreproachable till pooh me
1784971 one and only kindness me a flamethrower breath f cking chickabiddy yourselves
1784972 oh my god i need to drive out there take this girl dancing play catch up and then just fall asleep next to her even if i have to sleep on the floor
1784973 just think its 8 30 p m you are working late and havent had time for dinner you can ring ahead to the chef who will take a meal to your condo people will even come in and mix your drinks for you
1784974 our sales were good in the beginning but it got bad bad bad and then even worse
1784975 the market was red hot when we started this but it folded up before we could close it out
1784976 until the market improves you wont see anything getting built
1784977 we see orlando as the achilles heel of the condo hotel market
1784978 it will probably take orlando two or three years to come through this adjustment and there will be project cancellations
1784979 there is essentially no condo hotel market left this year
1784980 eighty five percent of the buyers were relying on second mortgages to buy their units and that is gone
1784981 there are some projects at the upper end that are selling but this is now a lifestyle buy
1784982 i think the market is falling apart in the condo hotel sector in much the same way that it is falling apart in the condominium sector in general
1784983 we have firm deposits on 20 percent of the units
1784984 we have tried to distance ourselves from the rest of the market
1784985 sure condos have slowed down but there is nothing like the blue rose anywhere in florida
1784986 hospitality is one of the bright spots in the real estate industry
1784987 true the condo hotel product is hurting right now you have to have a special product and we have one
1784988 its clear there are new people we dont know that are visiting the wynn and sands properties in macau and theyre properly and give them credit for it taking advantage of that and welcoming them here in the states
1784989 we need to level that playing field and we will do it when we open the mgm grand macau in the fourth quarter of this year
1784990 what is hidden is more interesting than what is obvious
1784991 atunci au inceput clipele noastre de cosmar au urmat doua saptamani in care copilul nostru se agata de viata de o punga de sange sau de una de trombocite ne rugam la dumnezeu sa fie bun cu noi ne puneam intrebari la care nu aveam raspuns de ce noi de ce copilul nostru au fost doua saptamani in care toata lumea a luptat mihai a inceput sa si dea seama de gravitatea situatiei chiar daca noi incercam sa ne tinem tari in fata lui au fost doua saptamani critice dar am sperat ca va fi mai bine si incet incet a fost

1785006 the most vocal opponents of the fda over the past decade or so are probably folk in the supplement industry they despite the threat of jail losses and other indignities for doing no more than providing a desired and responsible commercial service are by no means the most harmed
1785007 we chatted about it on or off for the last year and a half
1785008 theres a lot of business we thought we could create together
1785009 all of these new casino resorts will have a residential component along with the gaming component
1785010 but las vegas has never been more vibrant theres a tremendous depth in demand that is much deeper than supply i think we could build 20 to 30 high rises per year and still sell them but i dont think even five to 10 will be built in a year
1785011 there is nothing like this thats been developed in the locals market
1785012 the more units we sold the more money we lost
1785013 we have to have major price increases to keep up with market costs
1785014 the people that already have a reservation we are going to honor at those prices
1785015 i dont believe in saying guess what our costs went up we would never do that
1785016 that alone will be a natural governance on our market
1785017 three hundred to 350 million used to be a big project
1785018 theyve since agreed to move the garbage and loading docks
1785019 theyre trying to figure out a better solution were jointly seeking other options
1785020 so that it will feel like you are walking into a more formal las vegas of a different age or a classic monte carlo casino
1785021 were investing financially and creatively to develop an idyllic environment that reflects our personal tastes and interests and where we can relax with our friends who also love this town
1785022 theres limited financial involvement with potential for a very high return on investment
1785023 its a way for them to leverage highly valuable well known brands like bellagio mgm and even mirage and mandalay strategically theyre looking long term to become more than just a las vegas strip casino company
1785024 we are seeking others out and others are seeking us out to develop land we have or land they own in other parts of the world
1785025 we want to create an entity that would deal with this and into which wed put all these and future management agreements its an evolving thing
1785026 is a perfect example of how not to do something and then how to do something
1785027 at that height they will not be able to look down on us like they could from the towers
1785028 you cant pencil a self contained standalone casino anymore unless you add condos time shares and a fractional component
1785029 in any city there are different neighborhoods that play off of each other
1785030 fifteen billion dollars of it is projected to start in the next five years
1785031 theres not enough skilled labor to build half of what were talking about west of the mississippi
1785032 i am not convinced that we will see the interstate 215 lined with condos
1785033 but this is not going to be a nightclub dropped down in a hotel its going to have a very different look design and theme thats unique to the united states we dont want to be the hard rock or the palms
1785034 we didnt take anything for granted in the first month we dissected just about every kind of hotel on the planet
1785035 we dont want to build things consumers want now we want to build what they will want 10 15 50 years from now
1785036 reaffirms the growing sophistication and maturity of las vegas and sets a benchmark for new growth
1785037 i think it would be an understatement to say this project is an architects dream
1785038 its modern and theyre using quality materials its not setting up some disneyland like theme like fake venice and fake new york
1785039 for all the positives las vegas has its missing in the arts
1785040 i thought it was overly ambitious lofts starting at 329 000 but now thats a bargain
1785041 he was the first guy who bought into what he called my vision
1785042 but without him the success that weve had there wouldnt be happening you look at the skyline and see soho and that its a vibrant place for residential
1785043 it always takes the first guy to make it happen i was the visionary he was the doer
1785044 theyve seen a project that takes the risk and is succeeding
1785045 i get two or three hours of sleep when im doing good
1785046 as soon as i turned 18 i started buying properties
1785047 i was trying to learn every facet of the business
1785048 when you sit down with the banks they can tell pretty quickly if you know what youre talking about
1785049 sammy is very smart so when you talk to him that boyish look goes away pretty fast
1785050 and being jewish its always good to go to israel
1785051 sammy calls me and says we should build loft high rises in downtown las vegas
1785052 he said the mayors hot on it the citys hot on it everybodys hot on it
1785053 so about 8 p m we drove down fourth street and i could just see it lawyers were turning old homes into offices and things were happening there was just one thing lacking you needed people
1785054 ive been hard on money my whole life and it starts with cojones youve got to be willing to take the risk
1785055 im hard on my money and im a nice guy but my daughter or not i did it because i believed with all my heart in the project and i believed in sammy and he proved me right
1785056 and now we werent just in on the ground floor
1785057 his thing was hard knocks and learning it for himself
1785058 i dont think people realize the magnitude of whats going on were making history in 50 years people will say this is where downtown began its renaissance
1785059 downtown was a natural next step for development but by sam taking that chance he showed that there were real buyers out there
1785060 the competition is a lot different from when i started the platinum
1785061 there are too many projects and not not enough buyers to absorb the kind of inventory being created it just wont work
1785062 its a great development at some point the location justifies something more significant than a super 8
1785063 terrorism is a universal phenomenon that requires unified international efforts to combat it in a serious responsible and just way
1785064 this demands an international agreement on defining terrorism addressing its root causes and achieving justice and stability in the world
1785065 ways of enhancing understanding and cooperation among people despite differences in their origins colours and languages
1785066 who are suspicious about muslims and feel this is a pr thing but i think it was a bold and important step it was king adbullahs perestroika moment
1785067 nowadays you have news about war everywhere but there is no news about peace at this conference we sat down and had very good relations
1785068 the conference calls for international organizations to work to issue a document stating respect of faiths and religious symbols and criminalizing those insulting them
1785069 hey muslims seem like nice guys lets let them settle on mainland italy
1785070 it was written in the koran that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were sinners that it was their right and duty to make war upon whoever they could find and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners and that every mussulman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to paradise
1785071 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
1785072 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
1785073 i was born at tripler army hospital on such and such day
1785074 now in terms of knowing my commitments you dont have to just look at my words you can look at my deeds just this past week we passed out of the u s senate banking committee which is my committee a bill to call for divestment from iran as a way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they dont obtain a nuclear weapon
1785075 o come let us adore him o come let us adore him o come let us adore hiiiiim ba raaaaack o baaaaaaa maaaaaa
1785076 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
1785077 i suspect that his behavior represents a combination of these possibilities plus some other possibilities i am probably neglecting since an intellectual educated in a post modernist university starts from the premise that reality is constructed by those who have power he assumes that his words mellifluous and powerful are enough to determine reality
1785078 could you please explain to me what exactly you mean when you use the phrase
1785079 i know this project is going to be a huge success
1785080 youre not going to see a lot of these other towers get built
1785081 we blow everything out of the water we have the best location and the best building
1785082 weve known of his interest in las vegas for a long time but we didnt know whether it was real or not
1785083 now hes put his money into it it was worth waiting for
1785084 this is one i endorsed because i knew it was solid
1785085 i know this is going to be a solid investment
1785086 they went so quickly because of the name the trump name is associated with quality
1785087 theres no doubt in my mind that this will get built i think it will be the most successful project in las vegas
1785088 i said to him youve got to be kidding it was a b site at the back of the property and at the north end of the strip
1785089 this is the best thing that could have happened for trump he can put his big gold letters across the street from wynns big gold letters
1785090 the costs are high its pretty tough to build a big casino these days
1785091 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
1785092 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
1785093 massive increase in the muslim population is not to seize power
1785094 but to create enclaves where the government dare not show its face
1785095 immigrants are more eager to leave those ghettos than they are to stay there
1785096 its the combination of rising construction costs rising land prices and the fact that the mid and high rise condo market in las vegas is still in its infancy
1785097 theres a certain segment that are more promoters than developers more snake oil salesmen
1785098 the true ones are the ones who have built in other cities bosa development turnberry associates related cos
1785099 there are other guys who have a web site and a dream
1785100 if you ask if theyve ever built a high rise they look at their shoes
1785101 the financing and lending of these projects is not as aggressive as it used to be
1785102 all the lenders are taking a step back and waiting to see what the market does what the interest rates do before they start dishing out more money
1785103 you could make the argument that after all the risks he altomare could get a return of 500 percent of his money
1785104 i would do the same thing unless you really are a developer you develop because thats your core business
1785105 it was all very seductive i was sucked into it
1785106 they havent built anything in the u s theyve made a lot of big claims and that itself makes me a little leery
1785107 since the left do not believe in g d they have no foundation upon which to base their belief that all men are equal
1785108 do unto others as you would have others do unto you
1785109 should be treated in the same way i want myself to be treated by others
1785110 all people should be treated with the same rights and respect regardless of their race
1785111 this is both an alarming and an exciting prospect but it begs the question of whether we as a society are mature enough and color blind enough to use the information responsibly
1785112 the fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself
1785113 just as government never could be able to improve markets or educators never could be able to improve human nature some self organizing systems defy all attempts to improve their function
1785114 if we could understand the genetic basis as well as the types of nurturance that offer the chinese an advantage at math and science we might well be able to eventually manipulate the genome
1785115 estamos muy entusiasmados con el lanzamiento de la versi n de grand theft auto iv para pc
1785116 el equipo al completo est volcado en ofrecer una incre ble experiencia de juego en pc el t tulo se ve y se juega maravillosamente en pc y estamos deseando que la gente pueda probarlo
1785117 let me just ask you a question have any of you formed an impression of what this person actually looks like i bet you have anybody
1785118 you can make your column whatever you want it to be about
1785119 the little guys the 1 and 2 million businesses were going to save downtown not some arena
1785120 during the time it took to resolve the lawsuit construction prices had increased so drastically that we were unable to build icon based on its original pricing
1785121 the strongest time to market and create project interest is when its first announced
1785122 the slowdown in miami has people doing more due diligence in this market you have to show progress people want to see its real
1785123 we cant announce a deal yet because its not finalized
1785124 it is going to be like the district on steroids
1785125 i want it to be a place where somebody would say i want to go there and spend a few hours or a half a day they can get something to eat go to the park go to the casino and do some shopping
1785126 there is not going to be a home depot a target or a sams club
1785127 its more for daily stuff like a dry cleaner grocery store restaurant coffee shops and lifestyle retail to buy clothes
1785128 we would like it to be a little bit faster but given the market conditions it is outselling anything in inspirada said jim widner regional general manager of kb home
1785129 i think whats going on is the market purely driven by a lack of consumer confidence
1785130 it would both impact our ability to conduct our mission as well as it would impact the safety of the las vegas public
1785131 in a nutshell its health and safety concerns that we have not only for the public but also for our military personnel that would be flying those high performance jets in and out of the base
1785132 we will fight to the very bitter end on that one because its something we should do and i hope that they the clark county planning commission approve our plan
1785133 and if they do then well start building and hopefully within one year it will be completed
1785134 were certainly open to continuing our great partnership that we have with the speedway but in this case we dont feel that what they have proposed to build is a compatible option with the day to day mission of nellis air force base
1785135 we all have been in communication together and were trying to work together but we just havent gotten there yet
1785136 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
1785137 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
1785138 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
1785139 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
1785140 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
1785141 antibiotic prescribing for adults with colds upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis by ambulatory care physicians
1785142 antibiotic prescribing for children with colds upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis
1785143 we have quite a ways to go to catch up to places like new york
1785144 this is the result of an exuberant market and us growing and honestly i had signed leases for nine offices now i have five
1785145 as you can imagine the four landlords are not happy
1785146 i cant afford to fight the market and pay attorneys too
1785147 is it a harbinger a sign that our economy is shifting
1785148 if someone thinks if they only wait a few months theyll be able to get that 400 000 house for 350 000 theyre going to wait it out
1785149 i think there will be more i cant imagine how the smaller brokers are paying their bills
1785150 maybe they can fund their overhead from their own personal savings but i honestly dont believe there are five companies in town right now that are very profitable theres just not enough sales going on
1785151 in 05 we closed 6 000 sales 5 945 to be exact
1785152 in 06 3 700 sales in 07 well do probably around 2 000
1785153 there are a lot smarter people than me out there already trying to figure that out
1785154 once the projects now under construction come on line it will boost the next phase of development
1785155 high density projects continue to sell but at a more measured and sustainable pace because of their scale and amenity offerings
1785156 the velocity of reservations and sales contracts have dropped compared to activity in 2004 and 2005
1785157 while it would have been an unreasonable expectation to believe that all of the projects in the development pipeline would enter the market as planned it would be equally questionable to conclude that resort and residential condominiums are a passing fad
1785158 the luxury condominium market continues to evolve and respond to the latest market conditions
1785159 we had a five point wish list for our las vegas development and vdara met all five
1785160 vdara offers amazing architecture an incomparable location world class services and amenities is just an elevator ride away from a vibrant casino and is backed by the best developers and operators in all of las vegas vdara will be the place to be in las vegas and thats exactly what our members have come to expect from exclusive resorts
1785161 exclusive resorts only buys the very best luxury residential real estate in the world by making vdara their next acquisition exclusive resorts affirms our belief that vdara is the best condo hotel in its class best in the world its the best choice for discerning luxury residential clients and will change the concept of condo hotels much as bellagio forever changed resort standards we welcome exclusive resorts members as the newest participants in citycenter
1785162 one of the things you need to remember is that there can a big difference when youre comparing condo hotel and pure condominium sales
1785163 the challenge for the cosmopolitan project was to find a prime location at the center of the strip where i could create a mixed use urban high rise property
1785164 i wanted to merge the concept of a luxury condo hotel with an equally spectacular full service hotel retail gaming and meeting space development additionally i wanted to bring in the las vegas business model that has been trending toward non gaming attractions and facilities
1785165 the complexs stunning glass enclosed atrium directly on the strip will be an attraction in itself
1785166 to accommodate the 85 foot deep below grade parking structure concrete slurry walls needed to be built 110 feet deep into the ground
1785167 to build the 30 inch thick and 24 foot wide slurry wall panel sections we drilled holes with a hydro mill and then placed 12 inch round tremie pipes into the holes with a funnel at the top ready mix trucks delivered the concrete via the funnel through the tremie pipe and down into the ground
1785168 delivering the concrete via the tremie system pipe versus through only the hydro mill dug hole which was filled with groundwater kept the concrete intact this method also prevented the concrete from bouncing off the rebar which causes the aggregates to separate
1785169 the dewatering system is the first of its kind in las vegas and was necessary because the water table is only 16 feet below ground level
1785170 the system will pump out up to 100 000 gallons of water a day for the life of the complex the dewatering system is constructed of sump pumps gravel and different fabrics
1785171 as we excavated deeper the site resembled a gigantic bathtub and the concrete slurry walls were exposed
1785172 we installed 3 000 tiebacks 85 feet deep through the slurry wall panels and into the adjacent soil which support the concrete and prevent the walls from caving in
1785173 deep underground parking like that used in the cosmopolitan project will become an increasingly familiar sight in las vegas as new resorts take up as much developable land as possible on the strip
1785174 weve worked with perini before and were pleased to work with them again on such a monumental project
1785175 we knew our putzmeister truck mounted concrete boom pumps and telebelt would be huge assets due to the need for multiple boom lengths and the shear volume of the mat pour
1785176 the 6 000 psi concrete mix being placed by quinns boom pumps is for the continuous footings various mat and concrete slabs and the west and east tower mat foundations
1785177 the mix is made up of 57 percent coarse aggregate and 43 percent fine aggregate which includes water cement and fly ash
1785178 each of the concrete mat pours started at midnight and was completed the following afternoon
1785179 our 42x meter and two 58 meter pumps stretched from the ground level down into the hole to place the concrete at the same time our 52z meter and 58 meter boom pumps and tb 130 were down in the hole placing concrete
1785180 it was a true joint effort by the six different machines we even had our 42x meter boom pump at ground level delivering concrete into the large 19 4 cubic foot capacity hopper of our 52z meter pump down in the hole where it placed the concrete
1785181 to date quinn concrete pumping has placed about 68 000 cubic yards of concrete at the cosmopolitan and will be on the project site through the end of 2008
1785182 the structural steel will support the massive 350 110 cubic yards of concrete that will be placed for the remaining 50 floors of the complex
1785183 we have also just started building the concrete elevator core for the two towers
1785184 i can see past all that i can see whats coming
1785185 when people are investing their home dollars down there crime as well as homelessness disperses
1785186 they know theyre being watched by people in their condos
1785187 you need people living down here with a vested interest
1785188 you cant pour that much money into downtown and expect it not to turn
1785189 there is the forum where the great debates took place and there there is where julius ceasar would speak to the people
1785190 mayor you come to my office and ill show you u s 95
1785191 the day i was elected in 1999 even though i wore the same eyeglasses i had on before i saw everything differently
1785192 we have phenomenally wealthy people who have invested in our downtown these are serious players this is not some guy taking a flier
1785193 ten years from now it will be a mini manhattan
1785194 this spectacular corner penthouse on the 42nd floor provides the new buyer with what some say is the best view of the most famous skyline in the world the strip this unit was among only a handful of select units still available today in las vegas
1785195 as opposed to other current projects which are timeshares and condominium hotels sky provides buyers the opportunity to own their own piece of the las vegas skyline offering homeowners luxury and location with a global address
1785196 sky las vegas has been designed with the luxury buyer in mind
1785197 we are continually striving to meet the needs of those seeking the best money can buy on the strip
1785198 in 2010 everyone will look back at 2007 and say that was the calm before the storm of growth there is currently over 15 billion in the pipeline and when this delivery occurs in the next two to three years the market will answer with increased prices
1785199 all of us are going to have the values of our property cut in half
1785200 they didnt tell us they were going to put the butt of it in our face
1785201 but we expected it would be integrated never would i have expected a wall obscuring every view i have
1785202 were always sensitive to issues and concerns raised by our residents
1785203 in this case however buyers were apprised of the fact that a structure may be built on the site adjacent to turnberry place that could affect views we believe they like the county officials who approved the plans will agree in time that the end result was built in an architecturally pleasing and tasteful manner
1785204 this is probably the first time there are residents this close to the strip there is no precedent
1785205 we are going to go all the way with this
1785206 we in the united states went down the wrong road
1785207 if youd asked that question six months ago the answer clearly would have been cost savings over corporate citizenship
1785208 now you can take something that might not have an amazing financial return and get it done because its the right thing to do
1785209 kebangkitan gerakan mahasiswa islam sudah tiba masanya dan kita sendiri sudah tidak sabar untuk mempamerkan wajah kita yang sebenar menawan kampus bermakna kita menawan negara tarbiah yang kita terapkan selama ini sudah meraung raung untuk dilepaskan dalam bentuk yang lebih kental lalu jiwa jiwa dan hati hati kecil kita bagaikan soldadu yang sedia menerima arahan untuk bertindak ya kebangkitan ini diumpamakan tiupan angin lembut yang tiba tiba meruap ganas ditiup gunung gunung tercabut diterpa lautan lautan bergelora
1785210 kalau seorang muslim hendak membanggakan dirinya maka dia semestinya berbangga dengan pelbagai cubaan dan penderitaan yang dialami di jalan islam dia mesti bangga dengan jerih payah perjuangan dan kerja keras yang dia persembahkan untuk agama ini dan dia mesti bangga tatkala di berjuang dengan penuh pengorbanan untuk meninggikan kalimah la ilaha illallah
1785211 inilah kelemahan para daie dan ilmuwan hari ini bagiku gagal untuk melihat bahawa kuasa dakwah pada hari ini kekadang banyak wujud dalam kuasa multimedia dan perfileman lihat sahaja berapa ramai yang tak pernah terlintas mahu membaca sumber sumber islam tapi akhirn ya masuk islam selepas melihat filem the messenger berapa ramai yang sebelum ini keras hati tetapi akhirnya menitiskan air mata apabila melihat 8 siri filem perjuangan ashabul kahfi
1785212 sex workers routinely face human rights abuses including the discriminatory denial of health services arbitrary detention by police harassment and sexual and physical violence
1785213 this award recognizes the extraordinary contribution of the asia pacific network of sex workers in the struggle for sex workers rights
1785214 i am honored to accept this award on behalf of the asia pacific network for sex workers
1785215 international recognition of sex workers human rights is vital to curb the hiv pandemic governments and un agencies need to promote sustainable comprehensive hiv prevention and care initiatives for sex workers that are community led and protect their human rights
1785216 being a part of apnsw working in solidarity with tens of thousands of sex workers in the region has allowed us to challenge the way the authorities have applied this law in cambodia and to gain strength to bring this issue to international attention
1785217 the international aids conference presents a forum to focus worldwide attention on the epidemic and our global response
1785218 unfortunately too often that response has been tainted by prejudice and misinformation only by ensuring the health and human rights of sex workers will governments un agencies donors and nongovernmental groups be effective at reducing the vulnerability of sex workers to hiv infection the asia pacific networks work epitomizes this
1785219 please god help us get out of this alive help me know what to do or where to hide until this chaos passes
1785220 find a place to hide out and protect these women and if you get the chance run like hell all of you
1785221 let my death give these people a chance at seeing their families again and please forgive my sins because im probably going to meet you face to face today and i dont want to go to hell im already there and this guy towering over me with all the weaponry is the devil

1785225 buddhism has always been fond of parables and many of these were used by the buddha himself
1785226 what a splendid animal i must have him to ride upon
1785227 i adorn you with silk and jewels i give you the finest food and the purest water yet you do not eat or drink what will please you
1785228 silk and jewels food and drink do not make me happy my blind old mother is alone in the forest with no one to care for her though i may die i will take no food or water until i give some to her first
1785229 never have i seen such kindness not even among humans it is not right to keep this young elephant in chains
1785230 may the king rejoice today as i rejoice at seeing my son again
1785231 sir there are living here in savatthi many wandering hermits and scholars who indulge in constant dispute some saying that the world is infinite and eternal and others that it is finite and not eternal some saying that the soul dies with the body and others that it lives on forever and so forth what sir would you say concerning them
1785232 once upon a time there was a certain raja who called to his servant and said come good fellow go and gather together in one place all the men of savatthi who were born blind and show them an elephant
1785233 when the blind men had felt the elephant the raja went to each of them and said to each well blind man have you seen the elephant tell me what sort of thing is an elephant
1785234 thereupon the men who were presented with the head answered sire an elephant is like a pot
1785235 then they began to quarrel shouting yes it is no it is not an elephant is not that yes its like that and so on till they came to blows over the matter
1785236 just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing in their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome wrangling and disputatious each maintaining reality is thus and thus
1785237 dont disturb me help yourself with the money its in that drawer
1785238 dont take all of it leave some for me to pay my taxes tomorrow
1785239 you took my money and you didnt even thank me thats not polite
1785240 no this man did not steal anything from me i gave him the money he even thanked me for it
1785241 you are their king why did you bother to die for them
1785242 im classy sophisticated patient and not blacking out on the front lawn later
1785243 im stealing your beer and there is nothing you can do about it
1785244 hey what if we make a bottle opener that looks like a woman you use her ass to open the bottle and she moans as you pop the cap off
1785245 wieso laufen meine kollegen immer so ungepflegt auf dem set auf
1785246 there appears to be a linear association between the frequency of slapping and spanking during childhood and a lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorder alcohol abuse or dependence and externalizing problems
1785247 he who spares his rod hates his son but he who loves him disciplines him promptly
1785248 foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child the rod of correction will drive it far from him
1785249 do not withhold correction from a child for if you beat him with a rod he will not die you shall beat him with a rod and deliver his soul from hell
1785250 bad behavior represents a failure to obey and is therefore the occasion for correction but the focal point of correction is not behavior the focal point is the heart of the child that is called to submission to gods authority the goal of correction is not simply to modify behavior but to bring the child to sweet harmonious and humble heart submission to gods will that he obey mom and dad the heart is the battleground the spanking comes only because it is gods method of driving foolishness far from your childs heart
1785251 to demand that my country join an international treaty within the next 2 years that cuts global warming pollution by 90 in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy earth
1785252 the blood of those 77 000 people a year is therefore on bushs hands
1785253 let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
1785254 be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the earth
1785255 for this they willfully forget that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of water and in the water by which the world that then existed perished being flooded with water but the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
1785256 where were you when god laid the foundations of the earth
1785257 who has divided a channel for the overflowing water or a path for the thunderbolt to cause it to rain on a land
1785258 can you lift up your voice to the clouds that an abundance of water may cover you can you send out lightnings that they may go and say to you here we
1785259 behold i am vile what shall i answer you i clasp my hand over my mouth
1785260 seek me and live 5 but do not seek bethel for gilgal shall surely go into captivity lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph with no one to quench it in bethel seek me and live this phrase is one that permeates all of scripture in the book of amos god is proclaiming his pending judgment on israel and all the nations round about israel these nations had quarreled and made war with israel took slaves from israel and sold them to one another practiced idolatry ripped open the pregnant women burned their dead and so on israel had turned their back on their god worshiped other gods oppressed the poor denied justice to the oppressed and despised those who told the truth all of these nations were ripe for judgment and were judged by god throughout gods proclamation of pending judgment however god is ever calling israel back to repentance the implication being that if they repent god will relent does god still call nations to account in our modern new covenant dichotomy 13 1 let every soul be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and the authorities that exist are appointed by god 2 therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of god and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves if there is no authority except from god and the authorities are appointed by god then the governing authorities have a responsibility before god the latter verses of amos 5 declare 7 you who turn justice to wormwood and lay righteousness to rest in the earth
1785261 it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of joseph
1785262 hell opens its mouth wide to receive you and if god should permit it you would be hastily swallowed up and lost
1785263 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
1785264 and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness
1785265 43 of americans say they dont relate to obamas background or values in other words to many hes unknown
1785266 we had a very good and lasting impression of sackville
1785267 sackville just seems to have a deeper more diverse group
1785268 sackville really comes through with the input that the cultural community has on the town
1785269 whether it be the high end touch on the graphics on a pamphlet to interpretive signage to floral displays and public art
1785270 for me personally it was a very pleasant change of venue
1785271 i mean weve been flying and driving from community to community for a three week period and it was nice to go for a horse and buggy ride and at the end we got some interpretive time at the campbell carriage factory
1785272 ik mag nooit meer ouders afraden hun kind naar een islamitisch haatcollege te sturen
1785273 this will give kids three years of solid instruction in their first language and bolster literacy rates
1785274 in terms of sackville the only people who will be watching my show other than my parents i think will be people who are insomniacs
1785275 the four olympic games before i was a reporter for cbc national news and now i have a whole new role for the beijing olympics
1785276 in the last olympics in turin italy cbc experimented with having a lot of the support people remain in canada and so this time around almost all of the producers and support staff will be in the broadcast centre in toronto
1785277 in a lot of ways that support staff kind of has the toughest job with very little reward because theyre going to be working the same long hours but they dont get the enjoyment of getting to be in beijing and soaking up in the olympic atmosphere
1785278 the setting is going to be fascinating and to see how china performs here off the playing field as much as on the playing field
1785279 la aflicci n es una herida que necesita atenci n para curar trabajar y completar la aflicci n significa enfrentar abierta y sinceramente nuestros sentimientos expresarlos y darles salida totalmente y tolerarlos y aceptarlos durante todo el tiempo que haga falta para que cure la herida tenemos miedo de que al reconocerla la aflicci n nos derrumbe la verdad es que la aflicci n no expresada es una aflicci n que dura indefinidamente
1785280 un individuo no puede vivir escondido en una cueva debe vivir en el mundo aunque no tenga ning n sitio donde ir ustedes no saben nada del perfume de esa flor y por eso la comparan con esta o con aquella otra es todo lo que ustedes saben hacer pero cuando un alg n d a dejen de hacerlo dejen de tratar de comprender que tipo de flor es esta y cu l es su perfume ver n surgir una flor completamente nueva no una copia no una rosa ya conocida que tantos miran ni un junco por qu toma la rosa tanta importancia porque a todo el mundo le gustan las rosas en el momento en que dejen de comparar y de imaginar que flor es esta y de definir su perfume ser n capaces de ver una flor totalmente nueva que no tiene que ver con todas las que la rodean
1785281 todo aquello que resplandece y posee un hermoso brillo atrae inevitablemente nuestra mirada
1785282 has olvidado que levantando los ojos puedes vislumbrar la tenue y resplandeciente claridad de las estrellas en la estrella que ha escogido tu coraz n entre la infinidad del cielo se halla la respuesta a tu pregunta quiz las estrellas tan solo sean visibles de noche para poder recordarles a los hombres que jam s han sido abandonados a su propia suerte y que siempre hay seres luminosos que velan por ellos protegi ndolos y esperando una mirada suya reclamando su ayuda los hombres olvidan cada vez m s la luz de las estrellas y levantan cada vez menos sus cabezas hacia el cielo
1785283 tu papel debe ser aquel que te sugiera el coraz n una vez hayas aceptado reconocer el camino que te conduzca de nuevo hacia tu esp ritu el papel que pueda hacerte participar de la existencia de todas y cada una de las flores de tu jard n y hacen que dejes de sentirte como un extra o dentro de tu propia vida como un incomodo blanco hacia el que se dirigen todos tus sentimientos negativos

1785285 a veces incluso las peque a cosas encierran su secreto como la ramita la linfa que alimentar y dar ida a nuevas hojas y frutos o como la piedra gris y opaca que esconde el diamante esto no significa vivir como sabuesos pero como m nimo nos invita a considerar esta peque a verdad
1785286 si lo nico que quieres conocer es su misterio entonces ves
1785287 el tiempo perdido tan solo es aquel en el que no dejamos a nuestra alma el espacio suficiente para vivir la vida que le ha sido otorgada
1785288 busca en los ojos de aquel que te mira de cerca y descubre tu propio deseo s capaz de amar con sencillez a un coraz n que late solo y en el silencio est junto a ti y a menudo suele ser ignorado
1785289 la generosidad fluye de un coraz n que se libera de los prejuicios y de los estereotipos de falsos moralismos y que al igual que un peregrino emprende el viaje del alma
1785290 why not put this to reflect on the past year and ponder about the days ahead

1785292 el reino de los cielos es como un hombre que sembr buena semilla en su campo
1785293 se or no sembraste buena semilla en tu campo de d nde pues viene esta maleza
1785294 corten primero la maleza y en atados chenla al fuego y despu s guarden el trigo en las bodegas
1785295 la semilla crece ah donde hay esperanza y no crece en la tierra donde no la hay es hombre de esperanza el que puede orientar su vida hacia una meta grande es capaz de arriesgarlo todo y trabaja incesantemente para conseguir algo que todav a no se ve los hombres de esperanza tambi n son hombres de f y que saben amar
1785296 estar en la presencia de la gente amada es una enorme buena fortuna
1785297 sepan que la discontinuidad de cualquier estado o condici n deseable es el catalizador para lograr una apreciaci n aun mas profunda de lo que es bueno anhelar el logro de las realidades espirituales las cuales han vislumbrado es el medio para lograrlas
1785298 yo te amo por nuestro se or por ninguna otra raz n
1785299 its the developers that dont have any track record for building high rise condominiums have no track record no construction company backing them and no long term control of the site they usually have a web site and a rendering a dream and a drawing
1785300 for the purposes of this analysis we assume that the 4 500 luxury condominium units under construction will be developed as planned
1785301 of the 32 500 proposed units that have also been announced we have assigned a range of probabilities of development from 30 percent to 50 percent resulting in an estimate of 14 300 to 20 800 coming to fruition
1785302 furthermore we estimate that approximately 35 percent of all units that are developed will be occupied by full time residents of las vegas while the balance will be occupied by the transient visitor segment
1785303 notably we expect that the urbanization of las vegas will actually drive higher utilization of both gaming and nongaming amenities at strip resorts
1785304 indeed we expect that the new condo projects could actually yield incremental market trips beyond normal hotel stays as patrons are likely to visit more frequently if they own a condo further we expect that residents both full time and transient guests will be regulars at nearby casino hotel resorts patronizing casinos as well as restaurants retail and entertainment venues
1785305 the tuscany style architecture fits in with the theme of the hospital
1785306 size wise it is larger and taller and will have a greater presence than the hospital
1785307 in the area there are several multi unit multi story facilities
1785308 the hospital has coexisted well with all of those we anticipate similar relationships and dont see any reason why it would affect us
1785309 weve had a lot of conversations with our developer and client he feels like he is a pioneer in this area bringing mixed use high rise or mid rise to the suburban area for the suburban setting
1785310 i think this will be the first of many projects similar to it throughout the valley
1785311 its a great step the county took to control over crowding and massive developments
1785312 in the long run it will make for really beautiful projects
1785313 the audience is people that live and work in las vegas as well as those people that frequent las vegas
1785314 we find it extremely outrageous that someone would breach their contract with our clients to reach a massive reportedly over 50 million profit for themselves
1785315 there appears to be an attempt to tender back checks and wash their hands of the whole thing
1785316 the question is is or is it not being affected by the cost of living
1785317 in terms of pressing concerns this one stands very high
1785318 over time the real essence is that las vegas is changing
1785319 over time there are going to be more buildings built than we can ever imagine
1785320 you would have to be a dead man in this town to think that those are not going to succeed
1785321 i know one thing for sure its going to cost you and i more to live here
1785322 everybody has a very clear picture of the supply and demand dynamics of the las vegas market
1785323 ive known most of these guys for 20 plus years
1785324 they were really fascinated by the concept of taking a business application from new york and miami to las vegas and combining it with local expertise
1785325 typically much if not most of the money that finances large scale projects whether in las vegas or whether in florida or new york all comes from new york
1785326 its a very onerous process that requires a lot of submissions
1785327 not everyone has the financial wherewithal and expertise to pull it off
1785328 the sales activity has not reflected that change in the market
1785329 there is no other city in the country that so many people want to be a part of
1785330 allure is actually one that will happen its fully funded and we are now in for permits
1785331 it will offer a metropolitan lifestyle for people who really want it all great views easy access to nearby neighborhood amenities but at the same time its an urban project
1785332 its unbelievable its all the phone calls i get anymore
1785333 weve been asked time and time again whether were going to go public they believe in us as operators and this gives them an opportunity to buy something in las vegas an extremely hot market
1785334 thousands of calls from people who cant stay here because there are no rooms available
1785335 in miami the focal point is the ocean and here it is the strip views
1785336 the south end will be the hottest part of the city in the next five years
1785337 some of these projects are taking on problems they are taking advantage of the land that is available and resources that are available in this valley and not really using them to the benefit of the community
1785338 theres so many of these going on every day you open the las vegas sun and theres another new project
1785339 theyre trying to give them cool green architecture names when you dont know if they will provide that amenity and service to people buying them
1785340 the south end will be the hottest part of the city in the next five years
1785341 some of these projects are taking on problems they are taking advantage of the land that is available and resources that are available in this valley and not really using them to the benefit of the community
1785342 theres so many of these going on every day you open the las vegas sun and theres another new project
1785343 theyre trying to give them cool green architecture names when you dont know if they will provide that amenity and service to people buying them
1785344 whats different about this and other projects that have been announced is that we have 25 acres to work with most projects announced will be built on two and three acres of land
1785345 the way were designing this our intention is to build a main street down the middle of the property like las ramblas in spain then with residential above it
1785346 it will be like living in new york city with lots of activity down on the street
1785347 this is the wave of the future of older low rise apartments and motel hotel type buildings making way for major projects
1785348 we will see these kind of properties redeveloped into higher and better uses
1785349 where density belongs is adjacent to the mass transit corridors
1785350 weve traveled all around the country as to how it works in other cities and now its up to educating the public on how to use mass transit
1785351 all those old industrial buildings are about to come down
1785352 it is a very viable area of town and industrial is not the highest and best use
1785353 we have constructed and leased almost a half million square feet in 22 months at centra point and what weve proven is theres great demand for people to live and work on the 215
1785354 ive lived here for 15 years and ive been waiting for some time for downtown to get some energy behind it
1785355 i started here 7 1 2 years ago when it first opened as key largo
1785356 this was a great place we had great customers and worked with great people
1785357 all the service people came over here when they got out of work
1785358 thered be a full bar every night two people deep
1785359 i just wanted to come down here because this is one of the last old ones i guess
1785360 i wanted to get a little piece of old vegas
1785361 i wanted to have little potted buckwheat plants on each table but they didnt think that was in good taste
1785362 there are as many property tax proposals as there are legislators
1785363 the question isnt whether were going to do something its what were going to do
1785364 whatever is done will have a significant impact on local governments
1785365 i say there has to be inclusionary zoning after awhile to keep the young professionals in downtown
1785366 but right now were letting the private sector take it at this point
1785367 out of state buyers are much quicker to buy the condominiums because they know the value of condominiums
1785368 theres not a lot of existing resident base that is familiar with high rise life and the value of a condominium
1785369 as far as announcements so many are sheer hype and people are entitling the land and looking to flip
1785370 so many have already gone by the wayside a few have gone forward but they are definitely the minority
1785371 people who think there will be 75 projects thats not going to happen
1785372 they have a great vision and can identify buyers interests
1785373 we really felt that he had the strength and integrity to make this project happen
1785374 he is one of the most informed condo hotel developers in las vegas
1785375 hes done it before he knows how to do it and hes doing it again thats a tremendous selling point
1785376 and his attention to details is unsurpassed with any other developer ive worked with in 31 years
1785377 were still going to have 4 95 steak and dollar drinks
1785378 ive never filed for bankruptcy ive never even been sued
1785379 what i fear most is someone coming here doing things the wrong way and then ruining it for everyone else
1785380 i think hes a perfectly competent developer and has an impressive track record
1785381 hes conscientious and seems to have a unique business plan in las vegas thats half the battle
1785382 youve got 180 000 employees within one mile of here who work in casinos and cant patronize casino facilities
1785383 its going to be the activity area because theres no more strip left
1785384 a lot of developers keep changing their name and leave a lot of people hanging when things go wrong
1785385 when i heard peterson was doing a project in las vegas i said hey count me in he does follow up after the project is done and doesnt cut corners
1785386 i used to go to vegas about once a year but this will make it more affordable for me
1785387 this is going to be a long process and we arent going to pull out of this overnight
1785388 to those buyers a million dollar condo is very reasonable
1785389 in two or three years your choices are going to be phenomenal
1785390 im going to feel very very confident that whatever proposal is accepted is going to be solid im not going to be going on a frolic on this one this is as serious as anything ive done since ive been here
1785391 the two groups have failed on this site primarily for the same reason
1785392 the product they offered simply wasnt right for the market down there there is nothing wrong with this property it is a great piece of dirt
1785393 i came back to texas and described it to my wife and she said we ought to look into that
1785394 the fact there was some income to be derived when we werent there was a pretty good incentive
1785395 ill probably announce when i close the sale that ill have some local partners with expertise
1785396 the condo market slowed so i stopped looking for a time but i got to know a lot of the realtors
1785397 the gold spike looked like an ideal project for me
1785398 i would be sad about the loss of the gold spike if it hadnt already been turned into a ghost of itself
1785399 i love downtown but im not naive enough to think it can just keep going on like it has
1785400 the el cortez is the model for improving while keeping the old spirit i dont know if other places should try the same thing though because i dont know what the market is for that old school experience it is more something people talk about missing than actually want
1785401 they told us we would not have to pay water connection fees
1785402 i knew there were a lot but i had no idea then again everything crappy thats happened is great for television
1785403 i thought what can i do to make them see this through i figured if i brought in a camera and they denied this it would look really bad
1785404 some day im going to look back on all of this and laugh

1785411 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1785412 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1785413 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1785414 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1785415 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1785416 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision

1785425 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1785426 the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1785427 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1785428 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1785429 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade

1785441 for example a typical reverse mortgage may provide to the consumer a 300 per month payment with a monthly compounded interest rate of 1 over the course of ten years the borrower will receive 36 000 but by that time she will owe almost 70 000 almost twice as much as she has received
1785442 i have an electronic version of your book about yield spread premiums i read the book and the information was fantastic

1785448 august is the mississippi of the calendar its beastly hot and muggy it has a dismal history nothing good ever happens in it and the united states would be better off without it
1785449 so having somebody you really like or really hate is important
1785450 i dont go around screaming every single day but for dancers ive always had enthusiasm
1785451 in scandinavia the kids are screaming my name and i turn around and say what are you yelling about its new to me in australia one dancer said i dont care that i got kicked off the show all i care is that mary murphy loved me that really makes my day makes my year
1785452 it usually comes after one of the hot and fiery dances when theres a dance that is absolutely moving to me its very difficult for me to go oh youre on the hot tamale train because im really touched and usually just about in tears so there are a lot more performers out there who deserve to be on it
1785453 my grandparents had this tiny lake cottage up north and wed always stop and get corn on our way up my grandmother would always taste it and say sweet as sugar every time thats what sweet corn is so incredibly sweet and incredibly perfect when its good its great with nothing on it but salt and butter by the end of the summer im done with it because weve eaten so much of it
1785454 weve got sweet corn all over the menu right now we have a simple pur ed sweet corn soup and a composition of four dishes as a vegetarian entree sweet corn pancakes a sweet corn flan a sweet corn arugula salad and a sweet corn ricotta mousse i like the sweet corn calamari combination so im playing with it to replace the halibut thats on the menu pauses now im thinking that maybe i have too much sweet corn on the menu laughs but its so good i mean i love sweet corn who doesnt love sweet corn
1785455 we saw it for the first time today at the farmers market sweet corn is like tomatoes i always forget how good it is i have a 4 year old and he loves corn on the cob with a little squeeze of lime some butter some salt i love watching him enjoy it and i love learning to love something all over again through his eyes thats really cool he likes to eat it typewriter style you know id forgotten that thats beautiful
1785456 i grew up with canned corn and frozen corn so it wasnt until i was here visiting my in laws in august that i changed my mind about sweet corn when i could go out and pick it and eat it right there thats when you get that incredible crunchy texture and creaminess when you pick it yourself i like it grilled more than anything with sea salt and a fruity extra virgin olive oil its perfect with the cob right over the charcoal a little bit of char on it just that great simplicity
1785457 i was pinching myself the whole year and a half that i was in the studio working with him because it was a dream of mine
1785458 i feel i was very honest and authentic and i didnt alienate my theater fans because i still sing big and challenging melodies yet i was able to be more intimate and personal because its my own music
1785459 im happy that i have the kind of career that is multifaceted and people are taking a ride with me
1785460 i have my own tour bus and my own band
1785461 to travel the country and perform my own music is something ive always wanted to do
1785462 im pretty spontaneous i like to field questions from the audience i keep it loose i get bored if i dont have surprises
1785463 it was many years until i actually saw another saw player live
1785464 novelty is something that gets your interest right away but its something else that keeps you listening
1785465 when i first started playing it took awhile to play more than 15 minutes
1785466 in a hardware store wed often check saws on the rack wed pull it off and bend it and snap it a little bit with a finger
1785467 unbeknownst to the sales person i take it off the rack and snap it with a finger and say wow this is good and with no more questions take it home get the bow out rosin up the bow and im pleased
1785468 as time goes on i began to realize it was probably a better sounding saw than my fathers saw
1785469 to be in a place where other people are playing this instrument was a mind blower
1785470 i shoulda blown everyone away with my two note harmonic chops
1785471 when i get up in front of a crowd you can see people pull out their cameras
1785472 i use it more to support the rest of the band
1785473 i try to keep it in the background because the saw can get loud louder than the banjo
1785474 everybody ive talked to are very happy and excited about the work that is being created here
1785475 im building a new landscape to show what exists here
1785476 i try to work with nature to catch the particularities of the landscape
1785477 i like to help people look at nature in a new way
1785478 how do i know that the person teaching the lessons has any real credentials

1785481 before people get any closer toward damaging the future of profnet the appropriate next question to peter is does he have a strategy or vision for haro becoming a long term business or is he still doing it as a whim with no idea of how long the service will continue
1785482 its one of these unusual situations where you have the potential of a condo high rise connected to an already unlimited license casino
1785483 buddy greco if you can hear this go home your wife is looking for you
1785484 excuse me i have to pay you to work here no you have to pay me to work in your casino
1785485 how are we going to live with each other in a one bedroom condo for eight weeks without my animals without all the stuff we have that keeps us busy here
1785486 what havent i done we returned all our phone calls we talked to our agent i sent out packages
1785487 why is it in the eight years we have lived in this house have i never sat by my pool once
1785488 east west did a really good job of creating a lot of energy and excitement over the building before it was built and they created a price point for that location that was going to have a lot of demand
1785489 its the lowest price per square foot dwelling you can get on the park
1785490 glass house was priced very well when we released it for sale which was intentional
1785491 its highly amenitized and riverfront park has really emerged as a pretty good neighborhood its 25 feet from the park
1785492 its good that it hasnt if its all investors you havent gained anything you sell all your units and the next day 70 percent go back on the market
1785493 when you look over a downtown area and you know that x number of units have been sold but there are no lights on in the development thats a problem but i dont think thats the case here
1785494 those who look for politicians and political reform for renewal will never find what they seek
1785495 life is a personal quest to enlarge the soul liberate the spirit and light up the brain on that quest politics was simply a roadblock of stentorian baboons
1785496 boring capitalism cannot hope to compete with all this moral certainty self righteous anger and sheer bloody excitement where is the adrenalin in getting up every day earning a living raising a family creating a home and saving for the future where is the moral crusade in buying and selling borrowing and lending producing and consuming
1785497 pessimism has certain advantages over optimism the optimist is wrong most of the time and even when he is right it is such a seldom occurrence that it fails to compensate the pessimist on the other hand has the satisfaction of being right most of the time and when he is wrong he is glad
1785498 the closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise the more impatient they seemed to become with it and with themselves as well they made a garden of pleasure and became progressively more miserable with it as it grew in richness and power and beauty for then perhaps it was easier for them to see that something was missing in the garden some tree or shrub that would not grow when the world was in darkness and wretchedness it could believe in perfection and yearn for it but when the world became bright with reason and riches it began to sense the narrowness of the needles eye and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn well they were going to destroy it again were they this garden earth civilized and knowing to be torn apart again that man might hope again in wretched darkness
1785499 i continue to be astounded at the way leftists who exhibit a hatred and mistrust of rules and government which lapses into psychosis are the same ones who strive to not only expand the rules and laws exponentially into all aspects of our behavior
1785500 nobody planned the global capitalist system nobody runs it and nobody really comprehends it this particularly offends intellectuals for capitalism renders them redundant it gets on perfectly well without them it does not need them to make it run to coordinate it or to redesign it the intellectual critics of capitalism believe they know what is good for us but millions of people interacting in the marketplace keep rebuffing them this ultimately is why they believe capitalism is bad for the soul it fullfils human needs without first seeking their moral approval
1785501 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
1785502 in past ages centuries and as recently as several decades ago religion both christianity and judaism much maligned and or ignored or not taken seriously by many in todays world did provide a structured and all embracing world view a purpose enforced a moral code and set out standards by which to measure a good life well lived
1785503 im not anti capitalism im anti laissez faire capitalism a road this country has been down on several unfortunate occasions in our history the current gilded age being one
1785504 once again the current bailouts of the rich and powerful suggest that the opposite is the case
1785505 that there is some sort of ill defined demographic liberals leftists socialist do gooders lazy activists poor people etc who are sucking on the governments teat while the strong brave capitalists are creating wealth and taking their lumps when markets turn against them
1785506 this book is intended to aid in the time honored task of the moral education of the young moral education the training of heart and mind toward the good involves many things it involves rules and precepts the dos and donts of life with others as well as explicit instruction exhortation and training moral education must provide training in good habits aristotle wrote that good habits formed at youth make all the difference and moral education must affirm the central importance of moral example it has been said that there is nothing more influential more determinant in a childs life than the moral power of quiet example for children to take morality seriously they must be in the presence of adults who take morality seriously and with their own eyes they must see adults take morality seriously along with precept habit and example there is also the need for what we might call moral literacy the stories poems essays and other writing presented here are intended to help children achieve this moral literacy the purpose of this book is to show parents teachers students and children what the virtues look like what they are in practice how to recognize them and how they work
1785507 if we want our children to possess the traits of character we most admire we need to teach them what those traits are and why they deserve both admiration and allegiance
1785508 the urban loft style home concept thats proven popular but highly elusive here in las vegas can be found at x it
1785509 plan 1663 really captures that style with large windows that blend the homes second and third stories part of which encompasses a loft space
1785510 this floor plans design allows the homeowner countless opportunities to customize the home to their own style
1785511 if someone is interested in a classic loft but with all the best of modern amenities plan 1663 at x it is hard to beat
1785512 what they the taliban did was they moved into an adjacent village which was close to the combat outpost they basically expelled the villagers and used their houses to attack us
1785513 i walk 10 steps down the hall and drop it in a chute
1785514 the analysis examined the degree of outward expansion from the urban core changes in density and degree of leapfrog development and then projected trends out to 2025
1785515 a fundamental characteristic of sprawl in this analysis is rapid and significant growth in rural and undeveloped counties again this has to do with the degree of change and so is relative to past patterns in each community
1785516 this is a postmodern city sprawling out to cheaper land farther and farther out we have high population densities because we have postage stamp sized lots
1785517 that doesnt diminish the fact that we dont have a lot of urban lifestyle or urban villages or anything that is part of the downtown core there are few housing opportunities anywhere near where the jobs are
1785518 the high rise condos could be a good first step but for now theyre more tourism related
1785519 it is a step in the right direction hopefully the next stage will be building those for people who actually live here
1785520 its a design issue big condo complexes can be dense but they are not smart growth if they end up isolating people from jobs and congesting road systems smart growth is about creating a mix
1785521 what bothers me is how much virgin land were putting to the blade of the bulldozer even though there are acres of land along las vegas boulevard that have nothing on them
1785522 so how are things out there its been pretty quiet around here lars is painting all the time and im just asleep about 18 to 27 hours a day
1785523 to come behind a 1 record and have a person whos currently relevant in dream one of the better songwriters to come through this industry and then do the jamie foxx thing the boss of all bosses i wanted to try something differently than i did on my last album
1785524 even my third single 1 fan with keyshia cole and j holiday
1785525 i wanted to load up two big features on that record as well try something different a lot of times you get a feature and its just you and that other artist i wanted to see if i could bring something different to the game see if i can force people to follow my trend
1785526 the cover for the red album was kind of a happy accident
1785527 we had a whole nother set of photographs that we wanted to be the cover and nothing that we were looking at ever matched up to what we felt that album sounded like and represents for us our art director got that photo the official album cover which originally was a fun photo ok everybody go as your alter ego and well take a kooky picture he said he put the red background behind that and thats what felt like the strongest image that matched how we feel the album sounds
1785528 the backpackers say i got a knack for being a true emcee but its the true emcee which led me to be a truer g
1785529 it might be strange to call these price decreases good news however given the market conditions it might indicate that some folks are finally facing reality and pricing their listings so they will sell
1785530 markets with a history of volatility are more likely to see price declines in the future
1785531 how many young potential buyers have a 650 to 700 credit score but are being rejected
1785532 i dont know the answer to the question but i assume thats a very large number this alone will keep sales velocities in many new communities in check
1785533 we will work around the large oaks to preserve as many as possible he said
1785534 it was a pill to swallow just for d r horton to buy it and sit on it
1785535 we believe that the economic hardships consumers are facing are impacting their behavior in various ways from making fewer trips to making more conscious value decisions
1785536 at the same time were trying to help meet our customers needs by increasing our value offerings we are fighting rising food costs which is having negative impact on gross margins
1785537 the perception of high prices that whole foods holds for most customers
1785538 we believe that it will be extremely difficult for whole foods to shed its whole paycheck image
1785539 as food costs continue to rise and other factors squeeze consumers budgets we believe that revenue growth at whole foods will continue to suffer
1785540 we expected an eventful quarter with weak results and restructuring but we got more than we bargained for on both fronts
1785541 and that makes it hard for investors to go out and accept a big premium valuation multiple right here right now but from a longer term perspective its hard to understate the growth potential of this company
1785542 at this time we no longer have excess cash available to distribute to our shareholders as that cash is needed to fund our growth going forward
1785543 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
1785544 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1785545 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1785546 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1785547 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1785548 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1785549 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1785550 the us military has been talking about and preparing for emp attacks for decades
1785551 a few hundred byte launch code to one of our nuclear submarines would have the rubble in iran bouncing for weeks
1785552 does the c in c have the stones to do what must be done
1785553 will israel or the united states do whatever is necessary to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons

1785567 paese solido e ha elementi di forza pur in una crisi internazionale
1785568 pensiamo che il nostro paese ha elementi di forza pur in una crisi internazionale ha detto tremonti il sistema bancario italiano a differenza di altri sistemi solido
1785569 le famiglie italiane sono molto meno indebitate e anzi hanno pi risparmio e meno debito rispetto ad altre popolazioni in altri paesi e per inciso i provvedimenti dei mutui crediamo che pi passa il tempo e pi sar considerato come fondamentale in questa strategia pi passa il tempo e pi si modificano le strutture dei tassi e sar evidente la struttura a rata fissa del provvedimento

1785597 when i was a kid imagining that there were other jedi knights beyond yoda was incredible weve never really seen those other characters fully developed and thats one thing we can really get into in this movie and in this series
1785598 also there are a lot of the clones that we can get involved with on the front lines and see just how they all contributed to this great republic that we always heard about in star wars and how it falls apart and becomes an empire
1785599 i try to stay very closely tied to the live action films as far as i dont want to interrupt the continuity that george created
1785600 but once we kind of moved away from one on one end and until we get towards revenge of the sith on the other theres a lot of room to explore
1785601 it was the second floor and it was really crazy we were like oh hi but she was so sweet she was very nervous
1785602 we dont expect it so for us its so cool to be nominated
1785603 its really really special for us its america and its our first american award and thats so huge
1785604 i think the jonas brothers are really successful in america
1785605 its so crazy i mean i still cant believe it
1785606 last year we were nominated at the mtv europe music awards they won one and it was the biggest thing we had and now it is the video music awards
1785607 i think we are the most nervous band in the world we are together nervous
1785608 we are right now in the studio in europe and we are producing our third record so i think there are some surprises
1785609 ive always have my laptop with me and a pen
1785610 i think it would be so cool to meet rihanna
1785611 unas cinco mil familias provenientes de 6 barrios obere os podr n contar con el servicio de odontolog a habr profesionales capacitados para la atenci n y equipamiento de ltima tecnolog a que permitir brindar atenci n m dica similar a la que ofrecen los centros privados
1785612 diagn stico y caracter sticas cl nicas de la diabetes
1785613 hemos incrementado la participaci n en la comision de la acedo y se nota mayor inter s en los j venes por participar organizar eventos y sobretodo sus carrozas pero notamos tambi n muy escaso apoyo de los adultos que siguen siendo reacios a confiar y apoyarnos
1785614 a los chicos les cuesta muchos conseguir galpones para las carrozas por ejemplo los chicos tienen ganas de trabajar pero todo sale muy caro porque le suben los precios el doble o no consiguen permisos para hacer sus actividades
1785615 nos preocupa el alcoholismo la drogadicci n y muchos otros temas que hacen a nuestra realidad entonces estamos trabajando en charlas encuentros sobre estos temas que se organizan a traves de la direccion de la juventud municipal
1785616 oportunidad en que se tratar solamente el punto referente a la reforma de un articulo del estatuto social a pesar de no estar de acuerdo pero fue as como lo aprob por mayor a el consejo de administraci n
1785617 de esta forma reconoci no se tocar n los temas que propusieron los delegados como ser el destino de los fondos del subsidio otorgado por el gobierno provincial de 530 mil pesos que en principio estaban destinados a la continuidad de la perforaci n del acu fero guaran las supuestas irregularidades cometidas por consejeros y la situaci n de electrodom entre otros tems
1785618 eso no significa que no pueda presentar alg n recurso pero la convocatoria debe salir como est ahora a pesar de que no es lo que solicitaron los delegados
1785619 a mi me toc hacer de trasmisor del inter s de los delegados y eso es lo que plasme cuando hice el requerimiento de llamado a asamblea general extraordinaria personalmente no estoy de acuerdo que se deje de lado las inquietudes del socio trasmitida por los delegados teniendo en cuenta la cantidad de firmas que solicitaron el llamado a asamblea entiendo que no correspond a que el consejo de administraci n y menos de manera dividida deje de ladeo la petici n
1785620 si nadie plantea la nulidad la asamblea no es ilegal el argumento con el cual cinco consejeros han sustentado el voto para negar el orden del d a propuesto por los delegados ha sido la supuesta irregularidad o ilegalidad en cuanto a un tema en si argumentando de que se tratan de cuestiones de administraci n personalmente entiendo lo contrario pero adem s si lo fueran eso no hace caer por si una asamblea
1785621 la nulidad aparece en el momento que se plantea y en este caso teniendo en cuenta que el inter s es de la masa societaria entiendo que el socio jam s lo hubiese planteado en tanto que mi duda es si alg n consejero si lo hubiera planteado eso es lo que se deja traslucir sino no entiendo el argumento en si
1785622 los temas importantes son lo que se dejaron de lado porque la reforma del estatuto si bien es importante no era el momento porque en los socios hay otras necesidades

1785659 the wildest fearless practical compassionate feminine energy the energy of the mother
1785660 it sounds mystical but its really discipline all the little rituals help me concentrate and once i get started i cant stop its like a new birth my whole body starts to change i have dreams about the book i forget the names of my grandchildren i forget everything its just the book
1785661 i looked at them and i realized i couldnt lie so i said no no they are from my imagination you havent missed anything most of my love scenes are wishful thinking you know when you are a grandmother like me you dont have enough time to practice the new trends
1785662 i never explain what exactly happens it is either perceived from an awkward angle or you just hear the noises the smell you create the atmosphere without going into the details
1785663 when i wrote the house of the spirits half of my family didnt speak to me any more which was great because i didnt have what to say to them either
1785664 this thing that began as a letter rapidly degenerated into something else that i didnt know what it was and after a year i had 500 pages on the kitchen counter and it was no longer a letter it was my first novel
1785665 there was a time when i felt threatened but i was also disgusted with living in fear
1785666 attempt to try as it were id say to diffuse the whole situation
1785667 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
1785668 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1785669 the brits wanted to avoid war which was what was driving them bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office
1785670 there was no such order from the white house to me or to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1785671 that the intelligence organisations knew that saddam had no weapons of mass destruction
1785672 bush is innocent until proven guilty or have we forgotten that
1785673 john charles menezes clothing had added to suspicions he was challenged and refused to obey police instructions

1785677 when people are investing their home dollars down there crime as well as homelessness disperses
1785678 they know theyre being watched by people in their condos
1785679 you need people living down here with a vested interest
1785680 you cant pour that much money into downtown and expect it not to turn
1785681 there is the forum where the great debates took place and there there is where julius ceasar would speak to the people

1785705 temos que recuperar com quem est aqui sei que n o f cil mas n o dif cil sair desta situa o porque temos potencial
1785706 n o adianta lamentar quem quer ficar tem que entrar com atitude para reagir
1785707 if its not love then its the bomb that will bring us together
1785708 people hear that word disco and they see bellbottoms and that 70s show no no no
1785709 this is real liberation music for people who know where to go this is the real deal
1785710 with sdv i can keep experimenting with remixes that were working on i can keep playing new stuff and i can keep finding old records
1785711 its almost a shame to smoke it its like killin a unicorn
1785712 to come behind a 1 record and have a person whos currently relevant in dream one of the better songwriters to come through this industry and then do the jamie foxx thing the boss of all bosses i wanted to try something differently than i did on my last album
1785713 even my third single 1 fan with keyshia cole and j holiday
1785714 i wanted to load up two big features on that record as well try something different a lot of times you get a feature and its just you and that other artist i wanted to see if i could bring something different to the game see if i can force people to follow my trend
1785715 i feel theres a lot of life to the tracks and a real solid groove things feel tight
1785716 its a lot of fun the material is very dynamic and we cant wait to present it to the world its been a great journey
1785717 connecting with them onstage was the first phase of the journey and then being able to create with them has been a great experience
1785718 it was the best school of song arranging in metal and rock you can ever imagine it was a wonderful experience theres nothing like it
1785719 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1785720 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1785721 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1785722 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1785723 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1785724 he is very gifted very fast and he kind of just fits in hes such a gifted musician and rob spent a lot of time being the third wheel in the lars james songwriting process and he just adapted to it super quickly and was great to bounce ideas off of and to come up with a great suggestion when me or james would get stuck he was right in there with us its been incredibly positive to have him around in the creative process the way we all connect with each other and the way we connect with our fans
1785725 its almost a shame to smoke it its like killin a unicorn
1785726 i keep it too real why is n as fakin
1785727 wish i had me some money id buy me some better luck
1785728 my presidents black my lambos blue ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
1785729 i had a day when my sugar was out of range and i sat down at the piano and wrote it in 20 minutes
1785730 and it was because i had this strong inspiration a lot of people have told me its inspiring
1785731 for me my vision has always been to be a positive light
1785732 at the end of the day the things that stick out are when kids say thank you those are my simple wins
1785733 my advice is that its ok to rely on other people and be positive because it will be ok
1785734 just recently at a concert nick had a low onstage
1785735 nick said i need a few seconds to stall so i just kept talking i kept looking for a sign and so they ended up making fun of me it went on for like five minutes but really i think its great that we have that support system onstage
1785736 an exuberant raucous and sometimes profane mix of sure fire crowd pleasers cheerful snark fests and thoughtful moving ballads that folds wrote at the end of 2007 following the finalization of a two year divorce
1785737 i was not interested in making a record about the d word
1785738 i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself

1785741 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling

1785745 rage is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band and from my perspective has undermined our artistic and political ideal
1785746 i feel theres a lot of life to the tracks and a real solid groove things feel tight
1785747 its a lot of fun the material is very dynamic and we cant wait to present it to the world its been a great journey
1785748 connecting with them onstage was the first phase of the journey and then being able to create with them has been a great experience

1785821 if you learned your biology a long time ago you learned that men have forty eight chromosomes but the number has now been revised downward to forty six twenty three pairs

1785841 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act mca this proces s of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward i supported that legislation which was a good faith effort by congress to meet the supreme courts direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial salim ahmed hamdan a trusted confidante of osama bin laden was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan

1785849 some districts do very well other districts do poorly i tried to do a state takeover of the roosevelt district because they did poorly and the state board chose not to do that
1785850 i persuaded the state board to have the state pay for them to take it as many times as they want and when they show they have the skills and knowledge we expect of a high school graduate then they get their diploma
1785851 we have many tens of thousands of teachers now attending our professional development classes and we work with them on effective ways to teach math effective ways to teach reading
1785852 in high school where the stakes are high we have six people read every paper so theres a lot more protection there
1785853 but i think the main factor really with the writing scores is that we just have a lot of students clustering around proficiency so a few points one way or the other made a big difference
1785854 as to whether it translates to any positive or negative effect on us i dont think so
1785855 the goal is to try to get either the supreme court or the congress to get the policy changed at the national level

1785869 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1785870 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1785871 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1785872 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1785873 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision

1785890 some of the protesters can be pretty mean in salt lake the paper reported that some of them were yelling at women and children calling them whores that would be hard to believe had i not seen it myself
1785891 really yeah some of these guys get a little out of control im not with them im my own preacher out here just trying to deliver the word
1785892 you know some of those protesters at general conference have been known to wave around lds garments

1785899 indeed aaron and thank goodness that times have changed i like you much better with a placard than the musket bucket of tar and satchel of feathers you would be utilizing to express your free speech in a different time and place

1785901 bloggers offer marketers a new way to reach consumers but you will need to know their rules before you can play in their sandbox check out these tips to make sure you engage them the right way
1785902 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
1785903 but how much mileage should obama be getting about his claim about this issue aaa says for every pound of pressure your tires are under inflated you may be losing 2 percent of your mileage
1785904 and the department of transportation dot found that about a quarter of you commuters out there are running your tires a few puffs short of full pressure
1785905 so if you could fix that would it produce the savings obama is citing 3 or 4 percent in overall oil consumption
1785906 the answer is yes if you assume like the dot does at least eight pounds of under inflation for at least one tire per offender
1785907 just last year a department of energy economist put the fuel savings from getting all puffed up at more like 1 percent so obama is using legitimate estimates to make his claim but like the sticker says
1785908 t he bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 barrels per day by 2030
1785909 we use about 20 million barrels per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1785910 which may sound like a lot but amounts to only four tenths of one percent of the ocss 18 billion barrels further why is time not only putting out an absurdly low number but also talking about the year 2030 the implication seems to be that the oil wouldnt flow until then or maybe wouldnt peak until then but such a claim would be patently false

1785934 the most threatening thought to the ego the part of us that likes being us is not god jesus or his course as one might expect but the power of our minds to choose god jesus or his course the light of atonement over the darkness of separation since the ego cannot destroy the light it does the next best thing it dissociates it by so doing it removes the lights presence from our awareness ensuring that we will never choose it after all how can we choose what we do not know is there moreover the ego continues its defense by dissociating the mind from the projected body after all how can we choose when the mechanism of choice the decision making mind is no longer accessible to us
1785935 there has not been a single prosecution of a woman for making a false claim
1785936 this is an extremely worrying trend and one where proper action should be taken if some csa claimants are getting away with making false applications it will not only slow things down for other families but it also sends the wrong message about the things were willing to accept
1785937 evangelisation through the eucharist in the eucharist and from the eucharist these are three inseparable aspects of how the church lives the mystery of christ and fulfils her mission
1785938 since the eucharist is the sacrifice of christ made present among
1785939 it is especially necessary that listening to the word of god
1785940 we should consider the great challenge of inter religious dialogue
1785941 the church has sought to build a relationship of open
1785942 this cannot be the subject of a dialogue understood as negotiation
1785943 on this journey we are accompanied by the blessed virgin mary to whom i entrusted the third millennium
1785944 during this year i have often invoked her as the star of the new evangelization
1785945 evangelizing is not merely a way of speaking but a form of living
1785946 to proclaim god is to introduce to the relation with god
1785947 this is why schools of prayer communities of prayer are so important
1785948 man is not satisfied with solutions beneath the level of divinization the only path is communion with christ achieved in sacramental life
1785949 a last central element of every true evangelization is eternal life
1785950 in considering the eucharist as the sacrament of ecclesial communion there is one subject which must not be overlooked
1785951 our longing for the goal of unity prompts us to turn to
1785952 the churchs unity which the eucharist brings about through the lords sacrifice and by communion in his body and blood absolutely requires full communion in the bonds of the profession of faith
1785953 it is not possible to celebrate together the same eucharistic liturgy until those bonds are fully re established
1785954 every commitment to holiness every activity must draw the strength it needs from the eucharistic mystery and in turn be directed to that mystery
1785955 the path taken by the church in these first years of the

1785958 true that it was not easy to read and accurately portray the personality of montini paul vi which was characterized by an intense strong and elevated spirituality jealously guarded by him and managed by his unmistakable style of gentleness
1785959 perhaps the press at that time did not take into account that paul vi took the second vatican council by the hand after its first session bringing it to a positive conclusion and promulgating all of the approved documents dedicating personal attention and precise interventions to the final approval
1785960 who desired to follow the steps of christ in the holy land and who visited all of the continents for the first time he is also the pope of ecclesiam suam populorum progressio octogesima adveniens evangelii nuntiandi just to name a few of his documents
1785961 the only pope to promulgate an apostolic exhortation on joy gaudete in domino 1975
1785962 august 6 1978 in castel gandolfo the 81 years of paul vi quietly ended
1785963 despite tenacious opposition and grave dissent in the church despite the merciless attacks and criticisms multiplied above all after the credo of the people of god and after humanae vitae paul vi never renounced the authentic magisterium and in reflecting on his pontificate he declared he had put everything at the service and defense of the truth and therefore he was always willing to defend human life
1785964 the republican idea factory has been a little stagnant in the last decade
1785965 hes never really engaged in a leadership fashion on a matter of national significance
1785966 he really doesnt have the requisite experience wisdom and judgment to be the commander in chief
1785967 say what you will about barack obama and i say a lot of negative things about him
1785968 we need leaders and john mccain is positive as well people gravitate when youve got something positive to say
1785969 they are signaling that the marketplace our consumers our customers are saying we prefer at least for now at this moment in time the products and services of your competitors
1785970 we need to spend some time as conservatives as republicans thinking about who were talking to and what we are presenting
1785971 we have some improvement that we can and should grab on to as a party
1785972 he represents in my view the new face of the republican party certainly the leadership of our party
1785973 and there are many people out there who are full of hot air all talk and when the time comes to do something no action

1785989 its virtually impossible to make any water bottled or tap completely free of contaminants
1785990 studies have tied high levels of chlorine byproducts to an increased risk of miscarriage
1785991 water systems that serve fewer than 10 000 people tend to have far greater problems with contamination because the funding needed to keep these facilities and their testing up to date often isnt available
1785992 it takes three to four times the amount of water in the bottle just to make the plastic for the bottle
1785993 and thats not including how much oil is used and how much carbon dioxide is created when the water is shipped to the store
1785994 even chlorine levels that are below the epa limit can dry skin and worsen conditions such as eczema and psoriasis
1785995 but no one should think that bottled water is better regulated better protected or safer than tap
1785996 leaving bottled water out in the car changes the chemical equilibrium so that the materials from the plastic go into the water faster
1785997 bottled water is an increasingly growing business and with that comes a whole lot of environmental impact that can be avoided by a turn of the faucet
1785998 bottled water causes 60 million plastic bottles a day to be manufactured transported and then disposed of in u s landfills its killing our planet and for no good reason
1785999 americans throw away 25 million plastic beverage bottles every hour

1786017 a quick look at most theocratic economies prove that such solution is a viable one worlds religious economical entities are much more stable last longer do better than technocratic energy financial and information based economies in finite periods economies like vatican mecca najaf mashhad stupas of india recently liberated karbala and etc are amongst the richest long lasting wealth generators in the world inspired by their enormous riches these sites thrive for peace among all religions and maintain tranquility for peoples who live under their domains agitations are counter productive disruptive undesirable and avoided tolerances for the sake of religious economies are encouraged and enforced security is maintained not by force of military but by spiritual convictions and faithful respect minorities comfortably congregate around these centers feeling safer prosperous and in turn maintain cultural tolerances amonst themselves peace and security also generates better economies that are in turn encouraged to maintain peace further we may conclude that religious sites that get distanced from their economical components by external interferences may get distressed and send out signals that in turn traumatize the rest of the human race through its deep seated spiritual constants jerusalem is uniquely rich with unmatched religious equity that can support ideological and economical basis for the most demanding diplomatic solutions it can bring riches to the land that can make all of its residents benefit and live in tranquility in fact a look into regions history shows that jerusalem had been maintaining moderate peace for more than a millennium and into the last half end of the 20th century

1786040 traditionally this ceremony is done when a person dies again when they are cremated and for each day up until 49 days after their death it can even be done many years after a person has died since time only pertains to relative phenomena and is not absolute
1786041 by doing these special ceremonies called nay dren we cultivate merit and wisdom for ourselves as well as benefiting the one who has died and all beings wandering in the bardo the intermediate state between this life and the next these ceremonies are methods for us to purify our obscurations and negative karma and they are beneficial for us this is true even if at this particular point in time the one who has died has no need for such a ceremony if they are already liberated from samsara so while we do this ceremony thinking of the dead person we also do these prayers for all beings who find themselves at this present time in between one lifetime and the next and for all sentient beings without any exception including ourselves since we all face death at some point
1786042 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
1786043 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
1786044 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
1786045 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
1786046 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

1786126 i need to do some research and talk to merchants myself
1786127 its definitely a deterrent to have the cameras down there
1786128 it would be worth looking at again depending on what the cost is
1786129 really weve got to look at whether they are worthwhile on an ongoing basis for their own sake
1786130 if youre doing nothing wrong you should not be afraid to get caught on camera
1786131 if its brought up at council then it would be the citys responsibility to install them if thats their wishes
1786132 i dont believe that any of this money should come out of the police budget
1786133 when we set out to design pennies we wanted a simple solution for personal budget tracking many of the other apps out there emphasize inputting a lot of information and other details when youre on the go and making a purchase though we think that its best to offer a really simple interaction with built in categories that takes seconds to enter an expense
1786134 i feel like the simple user experiences that we create appeal to a large number of people seeking straightforward solutions
1786135 inspire people to use their everyday actions to change the world

1786442 for the most part these social networking sites should be viewed as complementary to your online presence think of it as a nice to have not a must have
1786443 when used properly it is something that can gain your business some attention however you need to realize it shouldnt be seen as a replacement to your traditional online presence
1786444 sites such as linkedin can be helpful in connecting with people you want to meet for one reason or another twitter and facebook can be helpful when youre trying to notify a group of people about something you want to promote or about a happening of some kind
1786445 the viral nature of social networking is quite extraordinary and something that can garner a lot of attention to your efforts in a hurry
1786446 the site requires some r sum creation then offers the opportunity to link in to other like minded professionals when used selectively it can be a very powerful tool for identifying new business partners new employees or simply building your personal or business presence
1786447 consider establishing or joining a network on facebook based on your business or industry category to tap into peoples affinity for the topic by doing this youll cut through the clutter and clearly establish your niche keeping the interaction focused on the specific subject matter
1786448 cookie bonus solitaire is really fun and is great for a free ad supported game the only issue i had with the game is that the cards are very small and there is no method for zooming it could be hard for players with big fingers or limited dexterity to touch the right card i also found that on a few occasions getting the entire stack to lift when i wanted to move more than one card from one stack to another could be difficult
1786449 i glance at the headlines just to get kind of a flavor
1786450 the best way to get the news is from objective sources and the most objective sources i have are people on my staff who tell me whats happening in the world
1786451 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature sen obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
1786452 his majesty king abdullah on friday said that what some are promoting about jordan being the alternative to solve the palestinian issue is rejected by both jordanians and palestinians
1786453 embattled israeli prime minister ehud olmert declared sunday that israel and the palestinians have never been closer to making peace even as a widening corruption probe brings him closer than ever to being ousted from office
1786454 reaffirm efforts toward peace and prosperity and our close work with regional allies to combat terrorism and promote freedom
1786455 e leven minutes later after independence on the orders of president harry truman the united states was proud to be the first nation to recognize israels independence
1786456 and on this landmark anniversary america is proud to be israels closest ally and best friend in the world
1786457 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end it would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq
1786458 there are just 26 legislative days left before the end of the fiscal year this means that to get their fundamental job done congress would have to pass a spending bill nearly every other day this is not a record to be proud of and i think the american people deserve better our citizens are rightly concerned about the difficulties in the housing markets and high gasoline prices and the failure of the democratic congress to address these and other pressing issues
1786459 the bush administration is considering the withdrawal of additional combat forces from iraq beginning in september according to administration and military officials raising the prospect of a far more ambitious plan than expected only months ago
1786460 u s and iraqi negotiators have abandoned efforts to conclude a comprehensive agreement governing the long term status of u s troops in iraq before the end of the bush presidency according to senior u s officials effectively leaving talks over an extended u s military presence there to the next administration
1786461 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
1786462 this should be clear that this report is not just going to lie down put into some store somewhere its a report thats going to be used its a report that is going to help in bringing to justice or in making attempts very serious attempts to bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide in this country
1786463 this is a story of much greater significance than just my sister or one woman her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1786464 everything interfaces with security influences it and is influenced by it we must remember that it will all be meaningless if israel should be weak vulnerable and surrounded by enemies
1786465 the report was aiming to assess the conservation status of all primates so 634 species and the findings of the report are very very worrying for the conservation of primates 48 percent were classified as being threatened with extinction and thats an unprecedented rate among species and groups of species that have been assessed in the past
1786466 we are very pleased to finally have the shareholder derivative lawsuit behind us

1786475 dss management in place during the transfer of the personnel security investigation function to opm created a lack of accountability for assets posing an undue risk for military civilian and contractor employees who were investigated for security clearances between 1997 and 2005
1786476 without a receiving report and invoice we dont know what we paid for
1786477 investigators looked at 53 payment vouchers and couldnt find even one that adequately explained where the money went
1786478 contained sufficient supporting documentation to provide reasonable assurance that these funds were used for their intended purpose
1786479 what equipment is due in due out issued and on hand
1786480 when we turned them over to the iraqis they werent properly accounted for
1786481 this cost of this war is approaching 15 billion a month with the army spending 4 2 billion of that every month
1786482 iraq afghanistan and the war on terror are not getting cheaper this will go down some as the surge comes home but not as much as people think
1786483 more and more of these so called emergency funds are being used to repair and buy new military hardware
1786484 the pentagon is worried that defense budgets will start to go down next year
1786485 more often to upgrade and replace stressed equipment and enhance force protection
1786486 found that more than 40 of the armys spending for repair and replacement of war worn equipment
1786487 spent to upgrade systems to increase capability to buy equipment to eliminate longstanding shortfalls in inventory
1786488 responsible for satisfying the employment tax reporting filing and payment obligations that result from this determination
1786489 its been determined that the way we classify personnel as independent contractors is appropriate
1786490 it is deplorable that a company that depends on federal tax dollars for over 90 percent of its business would even contemplate forbidding an employee to report corporate wrongdoing to congress and federal law enforcement officials
1786491 of the multiple thousands of people who have worked for us just one has made this claim
1786492 in the military services theres a sentiment that we can do whatever we want because no one serious is looking over our shoulder
1786493 dod acquisition and contracting community continues to face the stress of managing the increasing defense budget with a smaller and less capable workforce
1786494 i cant stress enough what an incredibly open and transparent and rigorous first selection we have gone through
1786495 we have been extremely open and transparent we have had a very thorough review of what were doing weve got it nailed and i dont see any relationship to what has gone on in the past at all
1786496 significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between boeing and northrop
1786497 could refuel all current air force fixed wing tanker compatible receiving aircraft in accordance with current air force procedures as required by the solicitation
1786498 weve not seen a document as scorching as this from an independent nonpolitical agency
1786499 they are essentially saying there is either incompetency in the air force or there was political interference that led them to bend over backwards to benefit one competitor because they feared the power of the purse strings either way the air force procurement system has gone horribly horribly wrong
1786500 it appears that the air force was at minimum trying to overcompensate because of the perception they were too cozy with boeing
1786501 take what the air force has been saying publicly the last four or five months and contrast that with what the gao found and theres almost complete discord
1786502 we are calling on congress and the democrats in congress to send the president supplemental war funding without arbitrary surrender dates and without micromanaging the war before they leave for their next vacation
1786503 more than just a debt of gratitude we owe them and their families a new way a way that leads home
1786504 both sides are playing a big game of chicken here
1786505 could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition
1786506 this administration is out of time to do a rigorous objective award for a major weapons program
1786507 it would be different if the gao had identified minor mistakes but it found major major problems there is simply not enough time to fix those problems
1786508 unitized group rations meals ready to eat health and comfort packs and other operational items
1786509 carrying out the extremely dangerous work of providing food for u s troops in a war zone
1786510 the u s government is seeking information relative to allegations of possible false claims security and kickbacks associated with the prime vendor contract
1786511 it is company policy not to comment publicly on pending solicitations for which it might compete
1786512 the rapid growth of the dod budget since fy 2000 leaves the department increasingly more vulnerable to the fraud waste and abuse that undermines the departments mission
1786513 directly linked to requests by congress to increase both audit and investigative efforts regarding southwest asia and the global war on terror
1786514 forced us to adjust priorities resulting in gaps in coverage in important areas such as major weapon systems acquisition wrongdoing by senior officials whistleblower protection health care fraud product substitution and defense intelligence agencies
1786515 the pentagons top cop is outgunned and its high noon
1786516 not able to provide adequate audit coverage of dod acquisition programs given the dollars expended by the department
1786517 18 of substantiated allegations against senior officials resulted in immediate removal from command reprimands reduction in rank and reimbursement to the government
1786518 since its inception costs have gone up dramatically while promised capability has steadily diminished and now with the armys badly degraded state of readiness from nearly five years of continuous combat in iraq i dont see how the army can afford to rebuild itself and pay for the fcs program as it stands today
1786519 were slightly lagging but were essentially doing the same thing theyre doing on the commercial side
1786520 the army had never done it they thought i was off my rocker
1786521 the expectation has been that it cant continue to increase as it has
1786522 but it has surprised everyone to see how long this increase has continued this budget was a great budget for all defense contractors it includes continuing growth not as fast as last year but it enabled everyones programs to be funded
1786523 the fiscal year 2009 budget may be about as good as it gets for defense contractors
1786524 we have had eight years of quite dramatic growth in the
1786525 the major area contractors have all done reasonably well but they all also have major programs that are likely to face growing scrutiny in coming years especially if budgets begin to get tighter which seems likely
1786526 the marine corps was optimistic in its belief that using commercial off the shelf systems with some modifications could provide a solution to meet the need for an internally transportable system
1786527 but if the improved security situation in iraq continues then they dont need as many of these mraps as they thought they did
1786528 there is additional value to the government for the additional fuel offload amount above threshold
1786529 appears to justify a bigger aircraft with greater fuel offload capability
1786530 i went over there because i felt like i wanted to be part of something that was helping people
1786531 and on an individual level a one to one level with the iraqis i worked with i really did feel that is what we were doing
1786532 they have volunteered to help create a new vision for a workforce of civilian employees who are expeditionary and ready to serve at a moments notice on the front line of supporting our troops
1786533 but i have such a feeling of really being part of something important and able to contribute
1786534 the full economic costs of the war to the american taxpayers and the overall u s economy go well beyond even the immense federal budget costs already reported
1786535 what this report makes crystal clear is that the cost to our country in lives lost and dollars spent is tragically unacceptable
1786536 the democrats didnt bother to run this report by any of their republican jec colleagues or staff
1786537 well see what they come up with but it sure seems that the senate leadership is trying to protect their continual proclamations of defeat instead of working for bipartisan progress
1786538 the war in iraq is certainly not responsible for all of this increase
1786539 has likely raised oil prices in the u s by between 4 and 5 a barrel
1786540 because of the many factors affecting oil markets this should be seen as a highly approximate estimate
1786541 wed like to look at what gao has said and then at the appropriate time make an informed comment
1786542 in most cases programs also failed to deliver capabilities when promised often forcing war fighters to spend additional funds on maintaining
1786543 is performing solidly making outstanding technical progress in the context of the most complex aircraft ever built
1786544 jucy lucy most over rated food item in the twin cities
1786545 i truly believe andy set this company up to be legal he is a proven ethical businessman
1786546 just because the feds take civil action against someone does not mean the allegations are true and this is one of those such case this company had only the best intentions shared the wealth with all involved and were working with their legal team to ensure government compliance on all laws
1786547 first of all they are a classic ponzi scheme because money is being paid out from new members investing to the old members who already earned their credits and are ready to cash out this scam is growing fast and there are more and more people cashing out so they need more new members to cover all the payouts
1786548 no me sorprender a si fuera de verdad y no me sorprender a si fuera un montaje
1786549 la aprobaci n del proyecto de construcci n de angra 3 es un retroceso para el pa s y una desgracia para ibama roberto messias entra a la historia como el hombre que firm la licencia de un elefante blanco radioactivo y minc opositor de la energ a nuclear como el ministro que se lav las manos ante este hecho
1786550 el jueguito es divertido pero la pregunta es fundiona como mercadeo a su favor o en contra
1786551 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1786552 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1786553 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1786554 i think hes probably just as qualified as everybody else up there that knows nothing about the art form of the business
1786555 one of your stair climbers just threw me off and i also need a band aid
1786556 guilty of always suing us like a bunch of jerks
1786557 guilty of trying to kick us out of his tree fort
1786558 why is the u s paying for the iraqi mess
1786559 there needs to be more oversight leadership and training to make sure they at least know what theyre doing
1786560 theyre not trained to do it theyre not used to doing it
1786561 its a little hard when someone hands them a bag of money and says manage this a little might fall out
1786562 dismayed by a lot of the findings and encouraged by the path forward offered by the recommendations
1786563 contracting expertise began to fade away as a desirable career track
1786564 iraqi officials did not make mnstc i aware that they were making purchases
1786565 the current demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable supply
1786566 we are consumed with meeting the demands of the current fight and are unable to provide ready forces as rapidly as necessary for other potential contingencies
1786567 we do not create a democracy at the point of a gun
1786568 sending more guns does not change that reality and this committee will not rubber stamp every request that is submitted by the president
1786569 its very important that we handle this drawdown in a way that allows us to end up in a stronger position in iraq in terms of a more stable country one that is an ally in the war on terror and one that is a blockade to iranian influence in the region
1786570 were at a point where the pacing of all of this is really what is at issue and quite frankly my biggest worry is if we handle this next phase badly then all bets are off in terms of what our commitments or what our requirements may be in the region
1786571 it is a stunning upset in which the underdog won
1786572 everybody expected boeing to win boeing has been doing this for half a century and it was simply assumed they knew what the air force wanted better than other companies
1786573 more passengers more cargo more medical patients could offload more fuel and had more flexibility more dependability and more availability
1786574 we believe that we offered the air force the best value and lowest risk tanker for its mission
1786575 we are outraged that this decision taps european airbus and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our american military this is a blow to the american aerospace industry american workers and americas men and women in uniform
1786576 it seems that senator reid wants to keep the tax title in there which the president has been very clear that he wont sign
1786577 im a little bit concerned about us keeping our expeditionary flavor
1786578 can i give a satisfactory answer to what were going to be doing with those things in five or 10 years probably not
1786579 wrap them in shrink wrap and put them in asphalt somewhere is about the best thing that we can describe at this point and as expensive as they are that is probably not a good use of the taxpayers money
1786580 there is the industrial base you have to consider the political implications are important this committee funds this program all this committee has to do is stop the money and this program is not going forward
1786581 an american tanker should be built by an american company with american workers
1786582 i thought we would be further along at this point but we have a lot of momentum building in terms of support and a lot of momentum building in terms of finances
1786583 americas economic might has still not been brought to bear in iraq
1786584 i have never ever behaved inappropriately with any member of my organizations
1786585 its not as quick as we originally thought but it is happening
1786586 we are just coming out of a very turbulent period
1786587 we were confronted with an opportunity that made economic sense for us and we also think its the right thing to do
1786588 i think what the task force is doing is very worthwhile and deserves peoples support
1786589 i came back thinking that we definitely found some opportunities and there was a chance to get some business going and get people employed and accomplish the goals of all of this which was to get people an income so they dont need to accept money to plant an ied or fire a weapon at u s troops
1786590 we have tried to get products into the major outlets with whom we work and to be honest we have not been successful we have been given any number of reasons but what it all boils down to is the uncertainty around the situation in iraq
1786591 j c penney is not planning any production in iraq however we did speak to a number of people regarding manufacturing and gave them ideas on how to alter trade policy to advantage iraq
1786592 if all the companies were doing was for the short term they could do it altruistically
1786593 for the long term there has to be some potential for it being a good business decision as well theyre struggling with balancing their natural inclination to do good with their business inclination to have to do well
1786594 rumsfeld had no problem accentuating the differences between the two sides
1786595 gates is much more moderate and hes talking more moderately in public
1786596 you certainly need to deal with china from a point of strength
1786597 you cant just jawbone it and allow the chinese to say just be patient were working on it
1786598 too much patience with the chinese will get you nowhere
1786599 there is clear evidence that the chinese cant trust iran to behave responsibly with any weapons that they sell them
1786600 that in our view should lead china to the conclusion that they shouldnt sell any weapons to iran
1786601 im pleased to report that were making some pretty good progress toward coming up with a fiscally sound budget one that meets priorities helps on some emergencies and enables us to say that weve been fiscally sound with the peoples money
1786602 in trying to push through a half trillion dollars in government spending this evening democrats will claim their bottom line numbers are in line with the presidents and their top line priorities are in line with the american peoples
1786603 but as page after page of this massive document makes plain neither contention is true
1786604 if the republican party has any intention of reclaiming the mantle of fiscal responsibility its leaders in the house and senate will have to rally the troops to vote against the bill
1786605 this is the mother of all gift cards to the nuclear and coal industry
1786606 the omnibus appropriations bill is totally inadequate to meet the long term investment needs of the country but it is a whole lot better than the country would have without a democratic congress
1786607 while the presidents stubborn opposition will deny americans the full investment they deserve in these priorities the democratic budget begins to reverse seven years of neglect and charts a new direction
1786608 what we have is a fat contractor in colt whos gotten very rich off our wars in iraq and afghanistan
1786609 and if you tend to have the problem at the wrong time youre putting your life on the line
1786610 the fact is the american gi today doesnt have the best weapon and they ought to
1786611 theres not a weapon out there thats significantly better than the m4
1786612 to replace it with something that has essentially the same capabilities as we have today doesnt make good sense
1786613 the guy killing the enemy with this gun loves it
1786614 im not going to stand here and disparage the senator but i think hes wrong
1786615 an attending medical official said could be attributed to water such as skin abscesses cellulites skin infections and diarrhea
1786616 exposed u s forces to unmonitored and potentially unsafe water
1786617 there is no evidence that any illness resulted from water produced or transported by kbr
1786618 production and treatment of water used by the troops and kbrs own personnel has met or exceeded all applicable military and contract standards
1786619 there was no widespread health risk or illness associated with the few problems identified with the water
1786620 instead of the pentagon taking the attitude that these are serious charges they acted like this was part of the buddy system
1786621 we now know they were both in a position to know what they were saying publicly was wrong
1786622 our troops were provided with water that didnt meet army standards
1786623 during his two month employment with cri mr riechers was employed in a scientific and engineering technical assistance capacity to the air force and made recommendations that were instrumental in engineering our acquisition transformation and continuing the air forces modernization of our aging fleet

1786628 members of congress ought to finish the spending bill for the department of defense before they go on recess so i can sign it into law
1786629 we got troops in harms way they need to exercise their responsibility
1786630 the presidents call today to pressure congress to quickly complete a defense spending bill that does not take effect until october is simply the latest example of the president shamelessly hiding behind our brave troops in an effort to distract attention from his failed national security record and failed conduct of this war
1786631 theyre now in charge and its important that they exercise their responsibility
1786632 theyve been dragging their feet on these bills they are now getting ready to leave for their august recess without having passed a single spending bill
1786633 massive spending bill that no one can read and in which anyone can hide wasteful spending
1786634 ill hang around if they want me to to get the bill passed
1786635 the bunch now running the congress want to return to the tax and spend policies of the past that did not work then and will not work in the future
1786636 and thats why i plan on using my veto to keep your taxes low
1786637 did not perform as a responsible contractor and repeatedly failed to meet contractual delivery schedules for getting vehicles to the theater
1786638 all resulted in increased risk to the lives of soldiers
1786639 that even a minor glitch in the supply chain can push things back under such tight parameters
1786640 i want to know if there is more influence peddling involved
1786641 we have to make sure a lesson was learned here

1786643 not unexpected given the urgent nature of the action and the fact the marine corps was trying to procure and field a complex new vehicle system without the benefit of a lengthy and costly development phase

1786645 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish
1786646 os varejistas est o come ando a se conscientizar de que qualquer perda reflete no faturamento e a preocupa o em minimizar essa situa o tende a aumentar os investimentos a m dio prazo
1786647 essa t cnica consiste na aplica o de etiquetas antifurto nos produtos durante o seu processo de fabrica o ou embalamento sendo a mais eficaz para prote o dos produtos al m disso ela possibilita aumentar os lucros porque mesmo os produtos mais caros podem ser expostos em locais de maior visibilidade j que est o protegidos com etiquetas

1786649 sem d vida os ltimos oito anos podem ser considerados hist ricos para o mercado de capitais brasileiro e isso se reflete na demanda por profissionais e servi os especializados
1786650 neste primeiro trimestre de 2008 tivemos um aumento de 88 em rela o a 2007 nos pedidos de profissionais para atuar em reas relacionadas ao mercado de capitais
1786651 isso aumentou muito a procura por profissionais de ri das reas de auditoria e de contabilidade e tamb m de especialistas em controles internos capazes de formatar mecanismos de governan a para garantir a transpar ncia
1786652 os profissionais passaram a receber dois ou tr s telefonemas semanais com ofertas de empregos e aqueles com dois ou tr s anos de experi ncia passaram a ser considerados veteranos verdadeiros dinossauros em ri
1786653 n o incomum que um gestor de fundos no brasil ganhe entre r 30 mil e r 40 mil por m s em m dia
1786654 eles s o obrigados a descer do nibus andando e t m de aprender enquanto fazem sem tempo para um longo aprendizado
1786655 na rea de ri por exemplo tivemos muitos problemas com profissionais rec m formados que eram contratados j em posi o s nior pessoas com 28 ou 29 anos de idade passaram a receber sal rios de at r 18 mil mensais porque a procura era alt ssima
1786656 at 2006 trabalh vamos com uma demanda semestral por dez profissionais em 2007 essa demanda j havia saltado para cerca de 40 profissionais requisitados por empresas ou institui es financeiras
1786657 no ano passado quando havia um excesso de liquidez e um mercado altamente comprador as companhias que fizeram ipos conseguiram cumprir as exig ncias m nimas
1786658 a partir de agora com a forte realiza o de lucros vamos viver uma fase de depura o no mercado e as companhias que entraram na bovespa sem uma cultura de capital aberto v o sofrer mais
1786659 muitas empresas mesmo as que t m cultura de companhia aberta ainda padronizam demais sua comunica o resultado da compra de pacotes prontos das consultorias externas e como estamos disputando os mesmos recursos no mercado preciso se diferenciar criar valor
1786660 o relat rio uma forma de integra o da empresa ao mercado n o pode transmitir uma filosofia pasteurizada porque quem conhece o neg cio ir perceber que aquilo falso
1786661 o processo de ida ao mercado precisa ser preparado de maneira consistente com vis o de longo prazo e o trabalho de rela o com os investidores n o deve ser um esfor o isolado da rea financeira mas estar cada vez mais integrado dentro da companhia

1786674 the wicket initially will have some movement for quick bowlers for a few hours on the first day
1786675 though the bounce may be little more it will be more or less like at ssc and galle

1786701 i dont believe frankly either bill is actually needed by the department
1786702 having that role prescribed and then making sure you selected people that would fit that role would indeed by helpful in my judgment going forward for the department of defense
1786703 whenever there is an issue we add something to it
1786704 after a while you just have a much larger bureaucracy that has to deal with all this
1786705 i am of a mind when it comes to management that less is better that is have the authority and responsibility but move it down as far in the organization as you can to hold people accountable and we provide the top level of direction and the oversight
1786706 the structures not nearly as important as how you tie the structure together

1786708 what we see is a deliberate effort on the part of chinas leaders to mask the nature of chinese military capabilities

1786710 we are seeing china emerge as a growing international space power

1787170 it is only fitting that this mural celebrates the key system at the former headquarters of an innovative transit system that moved thousands of residents around the bay area each day our development at 1100 broadway is designed to continue what the key system started a century ago by encouraging mass transit usage through smart and responsible urban planning
1787171 we along with a number of other highly regarded institutional investors recognize oaklands tremendous potential as a model for urban sustainability and livability
1787172 downtown oakland offers a wealth of cultural amenities transportation options and proximity to some of the bay areas best residential neighborhoods and has become one of the bay areas most dynamic urban centers
1787173 we are thrilled that publications like the new york times san francisco magazine outdoor magazine and bon appetit have all recently reported on the trends and developments that make oakland such a wonderful place to live
1787174 this mural and the restoration of the key system building are additional examples of the authentic urban experience that differentiates oakland from so many other cities
1787175 my basic vision of this project is to place a bit of past upon the present
1787176 i have always been interested in the repetitive nature of history and the reasons of nostalgia it has been said that if a society were truly satisfied with their present then nostalgia would not exist i dont know if i completely agree with that but the key route system and the strong sentiments felt for it offer a compelling example towards that argument if the idea of implementing an efficient electric rail system that would run throughout neighborhoods were put forth today in our current environmental nutshell it would be regarded as a long overdue act of wisdom

1787188 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1787189 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1787190 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1787191 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1787192 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
1787193 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

1787255 theres something in nearly every subject that relates to photography and its a topic that appeals to kids
1787256 the opportunity was an amazing chance to think about whats possible when we challenge ourselves to be creative in our classrooms
1787257 if youre not a professional photographer this is a great opportunity to invite a member of the community into the classroom as long as that person can explain concepts in age appropriate terms
1787258 we knew how a camera makes the image by allowing or blocking light through the lens and onto the chemicals on the film so we had to be sure we didnt get any cracks of light in our darkroom
1787259 it was cool because we learned about opacity translucence and transparent objects
1787260 its like a negative if light cant get through the object you use its all white on the paper it looked like an x ray
1787261 you can modify field trips maybe by having a speaker come into the classroom which we did too
1787262 it was pretty easy to get into discussions about the artistic elements of photography because the kids knew there werent any right or wrong answers
1787263 by the end of the program the sculptures had melted but the photos hadnt
1787264 they learn about images as a means to access their emotional cores
1787265 its an activity they like and they start thinking about whats happening in their cameras how to compose a photo how the photo will make people feel
1787266 relate really well to photographic concepts of enlarging and reducing
1787267 it was a taste of what real artists do with computers
1787268 the kids in our community often dont have exposure to bigger and better things
1787269 i really wanted our kids to see that there is life beyond the four walls of a classroom to teach them that there are jobs available that they find exciting
1787270 i liked when the lawyer came to talk to us
1787271 when you have photos you can tell the truth from lies and photos help you tell stories so people understand
1787272 what matters most is that the speakers can communicate clearly with the students whatever their ages
1787273 thats not anything a parent can teach a child if youre not into photography
1787274 it was a broadening experience for them and we all just really appreciated the opportunity
1787275 you dont have to have a lot of money or a month in the summer to make most of this work
1787276 we want that spirit in our classrooms all the time
1787277 dont be afraid to ask for what you need from local groups
1787278 when you are done living youll be remembered for the lives you touch and not for the meetings you attend
1787279 these internet properties have strategic value to an acquiring firm in the financial services or tax foreclosure market particularly given current market conditions and the state of the economic cycle the owners of these assets are offering the singular and plural dot com domain for a nearly 600 billion market with a high probability of growing substantially as the effects of the sub prime and arm mortgage problems cascade in the market
1787280 these direct request urls are relevant to the marketplace right now
1787281 a lack of tax escrow is part of the fallout of the arm mortgage issue
1787282 in order to afford payments on a property that would be otherwise out of reach thousands of people went into arms inappropriately often these loans were written without the collection of taxes into an escrow account this kept monthly payments low but it also created a massive tax liability that many were unable to pay

1787290 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them

1787306 these defense sites were always in a high state of readiness and security most people whether military or civilian had no knowledge of their existence we were subject to german terrorist attacks and constantly on guard against intruders and the very real threat of spies
1787307 the duty was nerve racking given the threat of russian agents in western germany and being on constant alert if an alert was called we never knew if it were real or not guys would suit up in nuclear biological chemical suits and physically maneuver the nikes into position you were always on edge and it took its toll on many good men and their families we alternated between absolute boredom and extreme adrenaline rush
1787308 we knew if it came down to it we were merely a road bump for russian advancement

1787310 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1787311 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1787312 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1787313 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast

1787338 as i went in and out the porter at the gate absolutely scoffed at me once i made up my mind to complain within the house but what could i have said of the dirty arab they would have told me that it was his religion or a national observance or meant for a courtesy what can a man do in a strange country when he is told that a native spits in his face by way of civility i bore it i bore it like a man and sighed for the comforts of friday street

1787451 my understanding is that child protection agencies although they had been involved with the family at one point were not involved and did not really have an interest in the case at the time the custody order was made am i correct
1787452 i do believe we need to find the answers about why this child died and the specifics to that so that any tinkering with the system that could prevent this specific instance from happening again we should do i also understand full well and i agree that we have been over this ground too many times

1787454 in childrens aid cases before they permanently place or before they ask the court to permanently place a child with someone they do criminal background checks but when childrens aid is not involved the court usually expects that the client and their lawyers will do whatever it takes to determine whether or not its best for this child to be placed in someones care
1787455 we do have cases from time to time where both parties will stand up in front of the judge both lawyers will agree that both parties will have joint custody of this child
1787456 it shouldnt be impractical to delve deep into these kinds of matters so for instance if youre going before a family court and theres sort of a private circumstance it shouldnt be private i mean is there anything more important than child protection
1787457 i think we need to put the resources in to looking at all of these cases

1787479 the development process of the restaurant master plan with 20 prix fixe dinners since last year has been the most transparent in the citys history i urge council to bring this plan to a vote at no later than its restaurant week meeting
1787480 if council had done its prep work and followed the developments of the restaurant plan there would be little need for multiple chain restaurants the public has already done its homework and made its voice heard loud and clear
1787481 nothing dilutes the voice of the public like service industry discounts and bartender to bartender favors and the only way we can remain certain this plan stays true to the public is to approve it before restaurant week
1787482 unfortunately councils track record of delaying and continuing important items is well known from inaction on the 16 month old gibsons opening soon rumor to missing the deadline for preparing the fy 2009 budget citizens will know who to hold responsible if the restaurant plan languishes for months with no action

1787485 in addition to improvements in various measures of dealer performance satisfaction with service delivered by new car dealers in particular also increased

1787487 satisfaction with the service experience is essential to increasing customer loyalty which can have considerable impact on the bottom line for a service establishment

1787495 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1787496 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1787497 it wasnt for money or anything it was just looking
1787498 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1787499 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1787500 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1787501 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1787502 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians

1787527 breaking with the legacy of a product that first shipped 23 years ago seems wholly necessary in terms of keeping the product manageable and in sync with computings state of the art
1787528 if midori isnt real then i imagine something of this nature still must be in the works its absolutely as necessary if not more so to microsofts survival as their initiatives around internet advertising search and cloud computing offerings
1787529 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
1787530 over the last few releases microsoft has introduced some major advances to the net framework that transform the way developers write managed applications

1787548 while blu ray discs bd offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content

1787551 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1787552 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1787553 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1787554 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

1787557 he knows im going to look at parentconnect every day and we will address it
1787558 i tell my son what you do as a freshman will matter to you as a senior
1787559 its not like anyone asked our opinion before they gave parents the passwords
1787560 its like having our parents or guardians stand over us and watch us all day at school waiting for us to slip up
1787561 i walk into my house and i dont even get a hello son howd your day go i get yelled at bcuz i failed a test
1787562 it helps keep the children minding their ps and qs
1787563 they either do what i do and embrace it or they say theyre in middle school and beyond and they need to be independent
1787564 my personal philosophy is that you need to be on your own but if you fail to do your job i will know about it
1787565 ill e mail the teacher please let me know if you dont get it within the next day because thats part of his punishment
1787566 im the mom with big horns but its been a fabulous parenting tool i think every school should implement it especially in high school when kids dont talk to parents and parents cant talk to each teacher
1787567 some teachers love it because it takes the burden of communication off them
1787568 their attitude is the parents should know what the kids grade is
1787569 theres nothing telling you that your kid loves the class but isnt a good test taker
1787570 my dad checks powerschool like 3 or 4 times a day
1787571 yeah he even came to my school once to tell me about it

1787573 ive been grounded twice for the same grade once when my mom found it on edline and again when i actually got the grade a week later
1787574 when the focus is on the grade so much youre saying to kids its more important to get the grade by hook or by crook than learn the material
1787575 ive had teachers e mail me theres a test coming up make sure they study certain things make sure they have breakfast
1787576 its about mobilizing all the resources that support student success these technologies can hurt or help depending on how they are done but the interpersonal connections of teachers parents students and counselors really are necessary to go beyond the impersonal technologies
1787577 some parents do not have access to high tech services
1787578 saying that those parents can use the computers at a local library is not equitable
1787579 it speaks to all your neuroses as a parent all this need to control that pressure to make sure everything is perfect
1787580 how are these kids going to learn to be responsible adults
1787581 i notice you have three zeros for homework grades so you need to talk to your teacher
1787582 you are not necessarily defined by the place where you were born or where you live a combined narrative makes our story what it is

1787586 republicans have been staging a protest on the house floor to spotlight democratic leaders decision to put off a vote on energy legislation until lawmakers return in september

1787588 repeat ed his call first made earlier in the day for congress to return from vacation to help solve the energy crisis

1787590 he cast his last vote on the senate floor on april 8
1787591 break from the road to concentrate on their obligations as lawmakers would be even more unusual for mccain than obama as senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada recently was only too happy to note mccain has become an absentee legislator he

1787595 when im president im not going to let them take vacation
1787596 his image of himself was always the handsome celebrity flyboy
1787597 took back a private promise to join mccains campaign finance reform effort
1787598 mccain could dismiss w as a lightweight but he knows obamas smart obama wrote his own books while mccains were written by salter
1787599 there is some strategy to it bashing the liberal media if you watch any great coach what they try to do is work the refs maybe the ref will cut you a little slack on the next one
1787600 there were days and times and events we might have had some complaints but on balance i dont think we had anything to complain about
1787601 ive gotten balanced coverage and broad coverage all we could have asked for heaven sakes we kid about the liberal media but every republican on earth does that
1787602 the liberal media were never that powerful and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures
1787603 dont believe the right wing ideologues when they tell you the left still controls the media agenda it does not any longer its a fact
1787604 the idea the media now tilt toward liberals is absurd
1787605 weve created this cottage industry in which it pays to be unobjective it pays to be subjective as much as possible its a great way to have your cake and eat it too criticize other people for not being objective be as subjective as you want its a great little racket im glad we found it
1787606 nb politics can be tricky to write about and to pin down because it relies on surfacing deep seated anxieties and archetypes that when revealed to the light of day appear ridiculous
1787607 you challenge the status quo and suddenly the claws come out
1787608 i understand that senator clinton periodically when shes feeling down launches attacks as a way of trying to boost her appeal
1787609 so for him to toss out comments like that i think is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination we dont need name calling in this debate
1787610 h e was in the law school but not of it

1787613 mccain has no realistic plan to help reduce gas prices
1787614 has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain raised in contributions of that size
1787615 in an effort to cast himself as independent of the influence of money on politics senator barack obama often highlights the campaign contributions of 200 or less that have amounted to fully half of the 340 million he has collected so far but records show that one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain raised in contributions of that size
1787616 i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in my first year hes shown a keen strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire people and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
1787617 despite the image of unity some sen hillary clinton supporters are still wounded
1787618 apparently including former president clinton who offered a decidedly lukewarm endorsement of sen barack obamas credentials
1787619 well in you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
1787620 i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in my first year hes shown a keen strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire people and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn

1787638 shouldnt it be 5 off since were paying you rent um and you should probably give us a warning first can i have my savings back
1787639 well you never stay out why are you bothered this is more a punishment for jamie
1787640 it doesnt matter i thought i lived here but i can go live somewhere else your fee is stupid and it doesnt matter who it affects more
1787641 you just made that up on the spot didnt you
1787642 would you believe that the last time i picked up a golf cart was at a radio contest par 3 hadnt picked up a club in 15 years and with my first shot put it four feet from the pin should have stopped there after that i swung and missed a few times and didnt ever hit the green again but i can see the appeal in that first shot heard i caused a stir around here by claiming golf isnt a sport how many blind women and 80 year olds and 6 years olds have you heard acing a hole and can you imagine any of them doing the hardest thing in say football
1787643 better than obama can you elect a president who bowls a 30 which hotties are we talking about im not much of a bowler i can bowl about 100 but i will say that bowling is as much of a sport as golf is
1787644 i watch very little television although i was told that the food network had some show that was trying to show miami and that there was a shot of me trying to park my convertible while smoking a cigar bloated sweaty guy doing nothing in the middle of the day whats more miami than that
1787645 ha im actually in about as good a shape as ive ever been in just gone done pushing tractor tires in a parking lot as part of some absurd training im doing no lie television kills me im 6 3 230 people think im short and 300 pounds that said as charles barkley says skinny people dont look fat on tv i whimpered to mike lowell one time that tv adds a lot of weight and he asked me how many television id eaten
1787646 goodell is a communist dictator fidel goodell he makes up the rules as he goes along i cant believe the way he has skated just circumventing our entire justice system by banning guys before they you know are convicted and everyone just sort of applauds because it is the easy thing for him to do from a public relations standpoint and it does nothing more than make him look good it isnt like guys arent getting in trouble anymore now they just drunk drive and flee their wrecked car he hasnt changed behavior he has just done the easy thing and filed it under leadership how would you feel if for whatever reason you were arrested three times because as an example the police just felt like bothering the rich black guy but you werent guilty and you went into work and they told you that youd have to miss three months without pay and then as seems to be the case with tank johnson and chris henry it is later proven that you didnt really do anything wrong on your last incident that would kind of suck i know these guys make very poor martyrs getting arrested a bunch of times seems like something most of us can avoid doing but unfair is unfair and it would be nice if the commissioner of the league at least let the legalities play out before he starts swinging his dick what hes doing isnt tough it is easy i dont even come close to answering your question did i i had an interesting offer the other day to host an nfl network show with deion and warren sapp it seemed like it might be interesting but i couldnt do it because i imagined myself getting fired by goodell within two segments
1787647 if not for the hurricanes this would be the greatest place on the planet to live i wouldnt live anywhere else even with the hurricanes
1787648 this favre thing is fascinating isnt it is he morphing into chad johnson and terrell owens right before our eyes he has an awful lot of selfishness on his resume sticking his beak into javon walkers holdout refusing to mentor aaron rogers theres a pain killer addiction in his past i dont blame him for being selfish most of us are ive never met an athlete who isnt professionally selfish no matter how much they speak in tongues about the cathedrals of unity harmony sacrifice and blah blah blah but i do wonder why favre gets until now to be the patron saint for sports heroes when you are seeing cartoonishly how amazingly narcissistic these guys can be i didnt answer this question either did i i stink at this chat im just ranting i must miss writing this is a profound moment of introspection im having right now as we speak but dont really speak im just yelling at you im now sobbing
1787649 we have three gms here who arent gm dolphins are run by parcells not ireland heat by riley not pfund and marlins by president beinfest not hill the marlins by the way are the most interesting baseball team ive ever seen they dont do anything well but hit homers they stink at defense baserunning bunting all the little things and until recently they couldnt pitch they just take porn hacks and the mets and phillies should be terrified because they make no mathematical sense and theyve survived being outscored all season and now their young pitching is getting healthy
1787650 that is one of the worst movies ive ever seen and one of the worst speeches there was an eyeball on the field i saw that guy with the giant penis anyone else know what im talking about here in new orleans once and couldnt quite place where i knew him then i realized it then i slinked away quietly and ashamed
1787651 im taking a break from pti for a while but i would love dropping from radio shows on national television ive done some secret signals referencing daves wannstache on national tv i dont take tv seriously if you hadnt noticed
1787652 because he was one of the top 10 offensive players in the national league last year in ops and because it makes no sense that the marlins would go after manny ramirez and give up prospects but wouldnt go after bonds when he wouldnt cost you anything whats happening to him is unfair and surrounds a ridiculous steroid hysteria that is the closest thing ive ever seen in sports to mcarthyism there are a lot of people still 2 0playing stained by steroids and of course people who are as competitive as athletes will use steroids if not policed hell the nfl is polluted by hgh and the nfl is policed the steroids story is the most overblown of my lifetime guillermo mota gets to keep pitching but bonds gets black balled it is asinine
1787653 georgia and alabama players are getting arrested a lot penn state too you know what that means dont you theyll be really good really soon
1787654 i covered the good and bad i was a reporter then not a columnist i loved so much of what they were doing all of it i love the hot dogs the rebels the anarchists lightning rods in sports but i was a reporter then covering the facts so no i dont have regrets none of the stuff we wrote about got them in any trouble they got in trouble for pell grants that wasnt my story my stories were about luther campbell putting bounties on notre dame players and the team priest unknowingly holding the bounty money how can you not love that it was fascinating those teams were so miami in every way everything happening in college football now has already been done here snoop dogg on uscs sideline we did that already the guys who did cocaine cowboys are doing a documentary on um football how good will that be
1787655 bloated sweaty guy doing nothing in the middle of the day

1787677 the development was stuck due to gt non technical reasons
1787678 the development of the mac os x native version of jiio is stuck due to non technical reasons
1787679 im amazed youve made it this far quite frankly you suck as a fighter
1787680 i suck is that what you think punk well i got a surprise for you
1787681 it wasnt necessary to blow his head off he was already defeated
1787682 yeah but the crowd loved it and any ways he shouldnt have been in this tournament to begin with
1787683 you know you have a serious arrogance issue with an attitude like that there is no way youll defeat me
1787684 right you keep telling yourself that save it for the arena then well see who is the best
1787685 its ok boy you can be in the next fight
1787686 that was a fine fight my son you did a tremendous job out there
1787687 yeah the guy was a thug he shouldnt of been out there to begin with but glad you enjoyed yourself
1787688 oh yes i was most pleased and the next fight should be even better
1787689 yeah ive seen the guy fight hes good by the way whats your name any ways i dont believe i caught it
1787690 father justin what are you some sort of cult leader
1787691 something like that you could say i serve a higher power one who wants to see this world cleansed of sin alas i must get going though my children need me i will be watching you closely and i do believe we will meet again
1787692 ah the air is electrifying today i sense a great fight we shall see
1787693 i dont doubt that both warriors have more then proven their own the crowd should be very pleased today
1787694 indeed and it shall be delivered tell me satanus who do you think will win between cid and judas
1787695 its too close to say both have strong spirits though i sense something more about cid
1787696 i must say i feel confident in cid today as i think he will win this fight
1787697 really we couldnt determine who would win in our opinion both are evenly matched
1787698 evenly matched no i wouldnt say that cid i know can pull this off just watch theres just something about him
1787699 today is the finals of the tournament and the winner of todays battle will face off against satanus first though they must battle each other and from what we have seen that fight will be most intense the question is who will come out on top both men are mysteries but both are also tremendously powerful i dare say that if push came to shove they might give me a run for my money yet worry not for they are here to entertain you that being said let the games begin
1787700 will you look at that you can feel pain and further more i think your embarrassed dont feel bad we all feel pain even you
1787701 indeed both men are putting on one hell of a show i havent seen skills like this in a long time too long in fact
1787702 he is definitely his fathers son though the blood of a warrior truly flows through him
1787703 he definitely shows promise but his father could not beat us and neither shall he look even as we speak he struggles against judas
1787704 my mission is simple i am too cleanse this arena of all sinners and that includes the likes of war calypso and all those who worship him
1787705 no let this play out this is the true test of cid if he cannot stop this mad man then i myself will ensure that no one dies
1787706 come on cid you can do this you can stop this mad man i know you have the power too
1787707 ha your pet is useless against my barrier and soon you and all the sinners within these walls will die today we the children of christ send a message that all sinners will burn in the fires of hell
1787708 no i will not let you do this i will stop you
1787709 thats not the cid i know you can stop this the power is within you
1787710 you have the power within unleash it in a blast the likes of which none have ever witnessed before take all your energy and unleash it in a torrent of power at your foe do it and do it now
1787711 no this is impossible father justin ensured me that nothing could pierce this barrier its impossible

1787716 political fallout from the pfizer decision not to fund medical communication companies meccs in july includes a business week article titled

1787722 the value of this law is not so much that police will seize your guns
1787723 it gives police a system to investigate a person who poses a threat if the police never confiscate a persons guns they can at least look into the persons behavior and perhaps prevent a tragedy by intervening
1787724 state police and 53 police departments have seized more than 1 700 guns opponents of that gun seizure law expressed fears in 1999 that police would abuse the law today the laws backers say the record shows that hasnt been the case
1787725 we need the federal government to update a 1950s era air traffic control system
1787726 that shouldnt be a surprise given that in june the industry appeared to be hitting bottom in many respects and last summer was often described as the summer from hell a period that spawned the passengers bill of rights movement and caused the faa to step in and put a cap on traffic at some of the busiest airports
1787727 if you want low fares youre going to have to accept more delays because there are going to be more planes flying if youre willing to pay higher fares then were going to have more on time flights

1787735 of course i can have a family without having children
1787736 for eight months a year were a family and at times things happen tempers flare up but its within the family and its a little bit rude when your neighbors are fighting next door for you to go over and ask what happened thats kind of the case here its nobodys business what happened
1787737 nothing needs to be talked about in the minor leagues theres no cameras on it but stuff like that happens all the time
1787738 i knew from the first conversation with stephan hartman about the us sports film festival that it belonged in philadelphia the greatest sports city in america where film is also a passion and a business
1787739 it didnt take much to convince governor rendell mayor nutter and my colleagues in tourism and economic development to jump on board and lend their support this festival will be embraced by philadelphia
1787740 philadelphia is a city that embraces all aspects of athletic competition like no other whether it is enjoying the recent professional successes of the phillies last year and the soul last month or regaling in the tradition of its collegiate and amateur athletic history
1787741 we are very excited about this relationship with governor rendell mayor nutter and sharon pinkerson from the greater philadelphia film office they all have combined to help make this festival a reality at a time of year when all four major sports plus all collegiate and high school athletic competition will be top of mind for both the casual competitor and the die hard fan it will be three day dream come true for anyone interested in sport
1787742 regardless of how a child is brought to our home that child is a stranger to us it takes time to bond
1787743 dont think you are not bonding instantly with your child because you are adopting bonding instantly is not always true it takes time
1787744 i forget that our child is adopted its so weird when people ask me about it sometimes
1787745 great innovative video content that doesnt fit the traditional format or time constraints of broadcast television

1787754 lacking guidance from agency headquarters country team officials have tried to establish agreements between state and dod
1787755 include clear goals objectives and milestones including output and outcome indicators and identify resources needed to achieve the programs goals
1787756 given the growing threat of terrorism in northwest africa as well as the possibility of the partnership programs expansion to other countries and agencies addressing these factors is essential to strengthening u s agencies collaborative efforts to combat terrorism in the region

1787763 the battle lines for the new world order were exposed at the world trade organization this week the breakdown of the doha round of trade negotiations over a clash between the united states and china and india about farm protection underscores how these new economic giants are changing the balance of power
1787764 i am willing to negotiate commerce but not livelihood security of 650 million subsistence indian farmers
1787765 she went out of the room for sometime and when she returned she simply dug her heels
1787766 after that a us official simply does not show up when negotiations resume and susan schwab heading into the finales of the negotiations stopped off in the press room to get her rebuttal in first
1787767 despite the major negative elements kamal nath told the media that he had accepted the proposals but the us had rejected it
1787768 the trade official who missed the resumption of negotiations was in consultation with schwab at that time
1787769 many ministers officials and diplomats have been speculating that the ssm was not the real issue that was irreconcilable in the most widespread view the us really did not want to face the cotton issue which was the next item on the g 7 agenda once ssm was settled

1787772 if we are successful this will really change the game for us
1787773 its a hammer and we can create a gas out of any biomass
1787774 there is a real emphasis on sustainability in the industrial world now
1787775 the price of not having sustainable technology is as important as the price of oil
1787776 when the republican governor of the reddest state in the union is promoting bicycling as a preferred mode of transportation you know people are paying attention to the price signals
1787777 could easily take 4 million to 5 million barrels a day of demand off the market in 10 years
1787778 i dont think anyone can deny wed be better off if we were not shipping billions of dollars to chavez putin and the saudis and developing products and services we can sell abroad instead
1787779 we never thought about the fact that everything depended on cheap energy
1787780 all the heavy lifting we did in the 1980s to reduce reliance on energy has made us less vulnerable to the energy shocks today
1787781 in the u s we get fired up about doing something when oil prices are high then when prices drop we forget about it
1787782 a seat like a la z boy and the power was exhilarating
1787783 i was in love with the silverados big engine but some things have to come to an end
1787784 my friends say dick you drive like an old woman

1787786 i dont think anyone believes prices that high were here to stay
1787787 after katrina gas got close to 3 and then prices moderated
1787788 we are getting the worst of both worlds high prices and low investment
1787789 it may not be a free lunch but its clearly a lunch worth paying for

1787791 that converts to 10 000 or 12 000 fewer cars a day
1787792 weve probably passed the zenith of the suburban auto oriented planning era
1787793 people are coming out of the woodwork to invest in energy efficiency or alternatives

1787826 the gold standard and the origins of the international economic system
1787827 central banks were generally more active in periods of gold outflow than during periods of gold inflow reinforces the view that they were essentially concerned with covering losses of gold in order to protect their reserves rather than ensuring market led adjustments

1787834 en consecuencia el schalke 04 el werder bremen y el barcelona no tienen obligaci n de liberar a rafinha diego y messi
1787835 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos no obstante pedimos a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico
1787836 estoy triste por los atletas porque todos los atletas presentes aqu en china sue an con los juegos ol mpicos y probablemente para esos jugadores el sue o no se har realidad

1787841 youd think it should be relatively easy to suspend my wsj subscription in new york and replace it with a wsj europe subscription here but youd be wrong
1787842 suspending a wsj subscription in the us for longer than 90 days is non trivial but doable with a single phone call
1787843 when you phone up to find out whats going on they say that they do have hand delivery in berlin but not it seems to mitte or at least not to the bit of mitte where im living

1787872 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1787873 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years

1787889 it doesnt matter our instructions are to never let him find out personally i dont want to know
1787890 do not let the timer go down never push the third button
1787891 i have desires to press that button if anything to satisfy my own curiosity
1787892 eventually something is going to happen how long do they expect us to be here either that third button gets pushed or that timer goes to zero
1787893 then it ends do you really think its going to get any better
1787894 go ahead and tell him anything you want im through playing this game

1787900 well need to reprogram i want it to want to kill them and it needs to kill faster
1787901 i know things come up at the last minute and sometimes traffic can be horrendous id like us to agree that either of us can leave if the other is more than fifteen minutes late would that be all right with you
1787902 it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
1787903 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this

1787970 the female condom works and is cost effective political leadership and funding are needed now no more excuses
1787971 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia it has been made doubly worse as the hiv epidemic is now affecting women at a higher rate than men especially in sub saharan africa we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
1787972 the female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves it has been embraced in many countries and cultures it works and it is cost effective political leadership and funding are needed now no more excuses
1787973 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more hiv infection rates among women continue to rise young women in sub saharan africa represent 75 of new hiv related cases the female condom would definitely cut the percentage down
1787974 it can be a win win situation for all especially for young women the most vulnerable group
1787975 my whole concern was the lightning but also the fact that it wasnt on top of us
1787976 the whole crew knew what was going on i told several players when they asked me about it if one bolt gets close im going to take them off the field
1787977 i dont know anybody who can sit there and say where there will be a lot of lightning
1787978 this time of year especially our job is to get the game in and thats what we tried to do
1787979 the lightning in my opinion even though it lit up the skies it was deep and away from the ballpark when that last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1787980 in every way imaginable that storm last night was in its own league
1787981 look im back there with all that equipment out there
1787982 no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1787983 it comes out to probably half of the whole years lightning in that area
1787984 wally bell did a terrific job two hours and 45 minutes he hung in there on a game that was already a legal finished game it speaks well of how the umpires do their business in a contending situation its an important game for people i think he went well beyond the call of duty giving it a fair shot
1787985 not only were the total numbers just off the charts but there was a disproportionate number of strokes that were positive charged
1787986 as loud and as bright as some of the lightning was originally he was given assurances that it was not close i dont think anyone who was on top of it felt anything was real close until the last jolt then it was definitely time to shut er down
1787987 i did note the lightning was very very vivid and very very dangerous
1787988 wally did the best he could it was his call the games in his hands and obviously no one was hurt so in this case he made the right call
1787989 its kind of like when you hit your funny bone it sort of felt weak

1788000 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
1788001 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
1788002 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
1788003 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
1788004 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

1788022 when i became a parent in 1992 for the first time in my life i experienced discrimination
1788023 then vice president dan quayle was mocking single mothers and when i returned from maternity leave it was made clear to me my childs needs such as doctors appointments and such should not interfere with my work
1788024 i felt someone needed to represent the other types of families
1788025 it taught me to speak up if someone is overlooked to make sure everyone is heard
1788026 when you are on the finance committee you need to be able to explain to people why their taxes are going up and i like being the one to do that
1788027 i think it is important for people to have someone they can go to and ask questions and i will talk to anyone who wants to talk about town finances
1788028 a lot of people are in the dark and i can help them
1788029 that is why i got on the finance committee in the first place to help people understand the mysteries and untruths that are out there
1788030 these junior operator licenses you dont need any training thats wrong

1788043 the kahn bani saad corrections facility was a uniquely difficult assignment the facility was located in a region plagued by violent sectarian warfare particularly during the months that parsons was on that project regrettably one of our subcontractors was shot and killed at close range while he was sitting in his office ultimately the government terminated our contract before our work was completed and parsons demobilized from the site in june 2006 after parsons the u s government awarded three successive contracts with different contractors to finish the work and those contractors were unsuccessful and all three experienced similar disruptive violence according to sigir in june 2007 the government decided to abandon the project because it was too dangerous currently the government of iraq has not resumed construction or secured the site
1788044 put your population behind bars so you know where they are
1788045 it cost the u s government 40 million to build

1788047 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1788048 there are some people with government portfolios who are supporting us because they are worried about their own security
1788049 they inform us of the movements of u s and nato troops there have even been some instances where they have assisted us in carrying out attacks
1788050 the haqqani network and other militants operating in the tribal areas along the afghan border are said by american intelligence officials to be responsible for increasingly deadly and complex attacks inside afghanistan and have helped al qaeda establish safe havens in the tribal areas
1788051 we are occupied by foreign forces so we asked our muslim brothers from all over the world to come join us and help us and they have come
1788052 but i had help from a serving afghan military general
1788053 it has become my moral and religious responsibility to defend the pakistani taliban from u s and pakistani army attacks
1788054 afghanistan under coalition watch has practically become a narco state
1788055 finally four 4x4 pick ups came for me in the early morning
1788056 they told me they were taking me to see their training camps and areas under their control i was afraid of being killed by either american forces or pakistani troops on the border or both
1788057 but they told me not to worry they knew all the safe smuggling routes into afghanistan
1788058 after two hours driving we reached sabaro in khost province a village under their control
1788059 the taliban were manning the check posts and there were no afghan army soldiers anywhere around i was taken first to one house and waited 1 amp 1 2 hours before being taken to a second house i still had no idea that i would finally meet haqqani
1788060 when i entered the second house i walked into a room full of taliban fighters there was one man off to the side who appeared different from the others he had no weapon this was sirajuddin haqqani no one outside of his close circles had ever met him before
1788061 i asked him about the allegations that he is running training camps inside pakistan
1788062 look i am sitting here in khost why should i go to pakistan
1788063 i know the pakistanis will capture me and hand me over to the americans i will stay here and liberate afghanistan from the occupation forces
1788064 we are occupied by foreign forces so we asked our muslim brothers from all over the world to come join us and help us and they have come
1788065 a snapshot of the presidential electoral process what does it all mean
1788066 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
1788067 when he feels that he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
1788068 he had been roaming the streets of frederick trying to pick a fight

1788074 goh ik ken veel vrouwen van mijn leeftijd die er minstens zo goed uitzien als ik en oudere ook mijn moeder is echt een stuk als ze een goede dag heeft ziet ze er jonger uit dan ik raar dat ik vroeger niet zag hoe mooi ze was als je kind bent is je moeder een soort behang ze is er gewoon pas als je volwassen bent kun je genoeg afstand van je ouders nemen om te zien hoe ze werkelijk zijn voor een tv programma had ik onlangs jeugdfotos nodig ik ben zelf zon schoenendoostype waar de oningeplakte fotos uitpuilen dus heeft mijn moeder wat voor me uitgezocht er zat een verlovingsfoto van haar en mijn vader tussen die fotos en ik was behoorlijk onder de indruk wat een lmster
1788075 ik ben nu vijfenveertig jaar en ik word misschien wel negentig ik vind het zonde van mijn tijd om me mijn halve leven lang oud lelijk en afgedankt te voelen het is volstrekt nutteloos om eruit te willen zien als een zeventienjarige die strijd verlies je gegarandeerd ik moet er ook niet meer aan denken om elke avond uit te gaan en pas thuis te komen als de vogeltjes uiten terwijl ik me toen echt niet kon voorstellen dat ik daar ooit geen zin meer in zou hebben zo bezadigd zou ik nooit worden haha
1788076 ik vind het raar dat je tegenwoordig niet meer ouder mag zijn het is nooit goed een vrouw krijgt rimpels en ze wordt afgberand ze laat er wat aan doen en ze wordt ook afgebrand op vrouwen die ouder worden wordt enorm agressief gereageerd ze worden van de tv weggehoond vooral door andere vrouwen zoals wij onszelf naar beneden halen en onze seksegenotes de grond intrappen daar zouden we toch eens mee moeten ophouden gelukkig is er nu veel over te doen dat we niet moeten streven naar onhaalbare perfectie
1788077 als ik meekijk met mijn dochter naar haar favoriete kinderserie slaat de schrik me om het hart dat wijfjesgedrag dat nu de norm is het gaat alleen maar over shoppen en de nieuwste kleur lippenstift wie heeft de leukste kleren het populairste vriendje de meeste vriendinnen het zit me hoog dat mijn dochter daar al op zon jonge leeftijd mee wordt vergiftigd je kunt geen damesblad openslaan of de vrouwen poseren gefotoshopt en al met getuite lipjes vooruitgestoken borsten en een wezenloze blik in de ogen is daar nou de vrouwenstrijd voor geleverd verschrikkelijk om kinderen in de waan te laten dat het meest belangrijke in de wereld is dat je de juiste schoenen hebt en de meeste vriendinnen solane is pas zeven maar ik probeer daar wel al met haar over te praten dat er andere dingen in het leven zijn die v l belangrijker zijn
1788078 whenever i lose my watch i take my sweet time to get a new one i savor the freedom from my compulsion to carve my days into minute size fragments but my liberty has its limits even if i get rid of the clock strapped to my wrist i cannot escape the one in my head the human brain keeps time from the flicker of milliseconds to the languorous unfurling of hours and days and years its the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution
1788079 i was pinching myself the whole year and a half that i was in the studio working with him because it was a dream of mine

1788097 jane and your lead paint watchers i am incredibly happy with this legislation
1788098 well we at clearcorps went out and bought hundreds of different toys clothes charms and so on in four different cities and with the free help of bill radosevich of thermofisher and niton we tested all this for lead the results were appalling
1788099 there was lead everywhere and it was readily accessible to young children who mouth everything
1788100 that was when we started pushing the need to reform the cpsc and also reform the entire manufacturing wholesale and retail industry
1788101 so the new legislation is a long time coming and it is incredibly sad that it took the death of a young boy to make it happen

1788118 being wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things and more time doing compulsory things and feeling stressed
1788119 the richest people spent nearly twice as much time as the poorest people in leisure activitities that were structured and often stressful shopping child care and exercise
1788120 they should think of spending a lot more time working and commuting and a lot less time engaged in passive leisure

1788131 when the doctor said what he said to me about different situations it was a tearjerker sometimes things happen when you have a 300 pound body on a leg thats been broken its tough pains not the issue its out of my hands its out of my doctors hands
1788132 i would never say this publicly because im not sure its what i believe but i think most teammates felt he was being a bit of a drama queen seeking attention
1788133 they have the right to be skeptical until he comes in and gets diagnosed by their doctors
1788134 i definitely am doing a lot better than where i was even a week or two ago because i was at the end of the road i felt like

1788203 poor little britney spears and lindsay lohan aint it awful

1788211 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy it wasnt designed to titillate
1788212 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree
1788213 whether people accept or reject an idea depends more on the way it is presented to them than on the merits of the idea itself

1788221 i wasnt that eager to see frozen river because basically i dont like the cold the times review said it was about poor people and the misfortunes they suffer which is not exactly a crowd pleaser yet the movie turned out to be surprisingly good even though i worried a lot about people falling through the ice an anxiety i picked up when i was in parks and responsible for lakes and ponds the story is fascinating and the acting is first rate as far as i could tell im not a professional critic the movie helped make you understand other peoples problems particularly poor whites and native americans who are depicted with humanity and grace see the movie but bring a sweater

1788227 in a hardware store wed often check saws on the rack wed pull it off and bend it and snap it a little bit with a finger
1788228 unbeknownst to the sales person i take it off the rack and snap it with a finger and say wow this is good and with no more questions take it home get the bow out rosin up the bow and im pleased
1788229 as time goes on i began to realize it was probably a better sounding saw than my fathers saw
1788230 to be in a place where other people are playing this instrument was a mind blower
1788231 i shoulda blown everyone away with my two note harmonic chops
1788232 when i get up in front of a crowd you can see people pull out their cameras
1788233 i use it more to support the rest of the band

1788263 the central question of the chicago conference was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapolated to explain the phenomena of macroevolution at the risk of doing violence to the positions of some of the people at the meeting the answer can be given as a clear no what is not so clear however is whether microevolution is totally decoupled from macroevolution the two can more probably be seen as a continuum with a notable overlap
1788264 no one questions that overall the record reflects a steady increase in the diversity and complexity of species with the origin of new species and the extinction of established ones punctuating the passage of time but the crucial issue is that for the most part the fossils do not document a smooth transition from old morphologies to new ones

1788295 when i tested positive i was completely shocked i was told to go see a counselor when i met the counselor she said you are infected hiv please be advised that knowingly spreading hiv is a criminal offense under russian law if you have unprotected sex and spread the virus you will be incarcerated sign this document to show that you have understood that was all the counseling i got when i got in the hallway i thought i would faint i didnt know anything about arvs anti retrovirals i found out about them only last year when i was in moscow
1788296 in this way economic dependence and fear of poverty drive women to remain in situations that endanger their health and restrict their access to hiv services
1788297 domestic violence and the fear of domestic violence restrict womens options when they seek care and treatment for hiv and aids
1788298 the high prevalence rate among injecting drug users the emphasis on them in targeted hiv interventions and the virtual absence of public awareness campaigns all contribute to the perception in russia aids that hiv is an ailment that afflicts drug users but not the general populace

1788301 with quantum computing you are able to attack some problems on the time scales of seconds which might take an almost infinite amount of time with classical computers
1788302 if you think about the spin of a particle such as an electron it can point up or down or at any superposition of the two partially up or partially down
1788303 you can store an almost infinite number of bits of information in one particle space
1788304 the spin of a particle is a very natural particle for quantum information processing
1788305 that enabled a thousand fold improvement in the storage capacity of disk drives from when we introduced it in 1998
1788306 the racetrack is a very tall column of magnetic material it is essentially a magnetic nanowire standing on end above the surface a silicon wafer
1788307 the boundary between these regions is a magnetic domain wall and that is where the information is stored
1788308 youre not moving any atoms youre just moving a magnetic orientation
1788309 it will probably take another five years before we have a complete prototype
1788310 in that case it would be faster and it would consume less energy than todays semiconductors
1788311 in the last few years people have been able to read one single spin and manipulate it
1788312 now some of the challenges are to do a lot of these operations efficiently
1788313 we could make a computer that is completely different than what we are using today

1788324 as if our government does not know that they are now imposing a 27 increase on electricity prices
1788325 the government ministers have proven their inefficiency beyond no reasonable doubt
1788326 if you do not do that within the necessary speed we will be back
1788327 we are simply sick and tired of getting a message from leaders we elected in polokwane that there will be nothing changing in economic policies we did not vote for non change

1788371 its really all wild speculation there is a big propaganda machine that would use something like this to imply that the regime is falling apart i think there will be a lot of speculation about this and all of it will be uninformed or misleading

1788400 applaus komt vaak per post en wordt ook wel eens wat later bezorgd
1788401 they were very eager to take the right action which was to apologize to their hosts
1788402 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1788403 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1788404 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent
1788405 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1788406 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1788407 we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1788408 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and in this case some of them did
1788409 were not chastizing anybody they came forward of their own volition
1788410 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1788411 they were overly cautious those athletes have written an apology to bocog
1788412 we believe hopefully this will be the last incident of this kind
1788413 be ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you
1788414 it cant be the simple act of prayer because the groups in question did that it cant be simply the study of the bible because they did that as well nor can it be simply the having of faith in the guidance of a loving god because this also describes them
1788415 how can you be sure that you are not yourself being misled by a false god
1788416 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
1788417 for whoever will call upon the name of the lord will be saved how then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach unless they are sent
1788418 so faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of christ
1788419 when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire dealing out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus and these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power
1788420 why did god make the israelites kill everyone off instead of simply having the land prepared and ready for them like he promised
1788421 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel
1788422 americans ought to be concerned about the judgment of a
1788423 ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it shall be opened
1788424 behold i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in to him and will dine with him and he with me
1788425 the lord is our god when you praise the father you praise the son when you blaspheme the son you blaspheme the father when you call on the spirit you call on the father and the son
1788426 he knew adam and eve would fall and he knew that the only way he could forgive sin would be if he sacrificed himself to himself
1788427 the day before he is to die he goes and prays to himself and begs himself to get himself out
1788428 please let me out of it i dont want to do this
1788429 if your god is not a reluctant god why did he wait 4 000 years before coming down and offering himself as a sacrifice there was no need and no benefit to waiting 4 000 years and issuing laws that hes just going repeal later
1788430 and why did he try so many other plans before finally deciding that the only way he could do it would be to come down himself
1788431 he knows all he knows the past the present and the future he knows the outcome of every decision anyone will ever make in fact the entire history of the world was known to god before he even created it
1788432 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
1788433 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
1788434 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
1788435 du sollst den namen deines herrn nicht vergeblich f hren
1788436 i dont question it its not my job my job is to perform and get the job done on the court
1788437 this is my opportunity to step up and be a leader on and off the court
1788438 the good thing about it is we have a lot of veterans and they know how to adapt how to make it happen and bring along the young guys
1788439 to get to 2010 we have to play the two years in between that and we have to win games and to worry about that i think is ridiculous
1788440 this same guy who has done all those miracles must be mistaken he cant possibly die but if he does well im gonna go with him
1788441 but if there are gifts of prophecy they will be done away and if there are tongues they will cease if there is miraculous knowledge it will be done away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when the perfect comes the partial will be done away
1788442 christians say that god wont reveal himself to you because to do so would take away your free will
1788443 we do not want this man to reign over us
1788444 so shall my word be which goes out from my mouth it shall not return to me empty
1788445 god is light and in him there is no darkness at all
1788446 1 flashing on his machine thrilled him it made him feel anxious and confused he still leaves his answering machine on and he never erased that message from the wrong number
1788447 fire was written to inspire listeners to live lives which are selfless seeking to make their communities a better place
1788448 ive found that when im full of hope and excited about life it spills out onto everyone around me same is true when im lost in my own self pity trying to make sense of the difficulty which is life a choice had to be made whether to write a disc focused on the negatives or positives we all face fire burns brightest when its surrounded by darkness i hope this album burns bright
1788449 we want to inspire people to find out what they are passionate about and then use those passions to make the world a better place if the lyrics and melodies touch you its less important what musical genre it comes from
1788450 the most memorable gig we have ever played was to 1 500 orphan kids in a rural city on the outskirts of moscow the looks on those kids faces are what strive is all about
1788451 when we got to going on the sessions i said whoa boy i was really pleased with it
1788452 isnt that a great song what a writer he was he wrote good melodies too

1788460 please read and answer the following questions they are helpful in preparing for the lords supper
1788461 a wine that has been chemically treated to remove all alcohol and sulfites is offered in clear glasses in the individual trays
1788462 do not attempt to obstruct or restrict anyone from coming to the lords table
1788463 on holy days and at other times when communicants are present mass is held and those who desire it are communicated thus the mass is preserved among us in its proper use which was formerly observed in the church and which can be proved by st pauls statement in 1 cor 11 20 ff and by many statements of the fathers for chrysostom reports how the priest stood every day inviting some to communion and forbidding others to approach
1788464 do i believe that jesus christ is personally present in the sacrament of holy communion with his true body and blood
1788465 a wine that has been chemically treated to remove all alcohol and sulfites is offered in clear glasses in the individual trays

1788475 screams various fluids and a name james ellison sound familiar
1788476 kinda hard to forget the name of the man who murdered my mother
1788477 yeah well hes apparently holed up in the bureau headquarters three miles west of here you know the one with the crap load of guards and more guns than the military
1788478 of course he has to be in the most heavily fortified building in the whole of los angeles
1788479 okay first things first ethan i want you to do a little reconnaissance
1788480 take cameron as well two pairs of cybernetic eyes are better than one
1788481 i hate to interrupt what would no doubt be an insufferable make out session but we do have business to take care of dont we
1788482 we need to call in help for this little endeavour and if they see you here they might ask for certain services in exchange so i need you to go with ethan and stay out of trouble understand
1788483 dont let her out of your sight not for a second you hear me
1788484 sometimes but not as often as you might think these places are very dangerous for people like john you dont want to be caught within a mile of a bureau hq
1788485 john never mentioned ellison when he told me about the bureau why is that exactly
1788486 john tied up ellison and had me torture him for information
1788487 he believed that ellison had something to do with your disappearance john was distraught and wouldnt be convinced by ellisons pleas of innocence john almost killed him but sarah stopped him in time thats when he came to the belief that you had purposely abandoned him because there was no other explanation
1788488 i would have come to the same conclusion how did ellison react
1788489 he went public told the whole of the united states that the connors were terrorists who were behind every terminator related event he even had evidence my neural implants somehow that bastard managed to get hold of them and used it as a lightning rod to summon all the power he needed to bring justice and security to the world fool he made it all worse
1788490 he led a raid on the house sarah was killed during the ensuing gunfight that was too much for john to handle he went crazy after that me derek and charley took him underground where we joined up with a powerful mob family the rest you already know
1788491 john killed the boss and assumed control very tyrannical of him
1788492 yep top floor office room six hundred and sixty six
1788493 this must have been their last stand john wouldve made them bottleneck thin them out
1788494 hey penny what have you gotten yourself into this time
1788495 what happened here how did the bureau find this place
1788496 they they came dont know how they knew we shot at them but they didnt die they just kept killing us all they they had your eyes
1788497 he led the final fight they hit us so fast we didnt have time to they killed larry then they shot through the barricade i took one in the chest and john he retreated and they followed thought i was dead i heard more gunfire then an explosion and they dragged him away
1788498 no no no penny cmon we need to know was john alive
1788499 im here just take it easy well get you patched up in no time just dont move
1788500 i knew the risks im just glad we got to have one final talk
1788501 please penny not another one of your three year old gossip discussions i can still survive this but if you start on about jolies new ill just lay down right beside you
1788502 for years weve operated in the dark hidden within the shadows and never struck unless we had the element of surprise we were so careful not to let anyone know this location and now it seems the bureau has machines working for them well that just changes all the rules from here on out
1788503 i must confess i do enjoy the irony of the situation mr connor
1788504 you do understand my meaning you do remember tying me to a chair once dont you
1788505 i remember not killing you when i had the chance imagine my regret after what you did
1788506 what i did was for the good of the world
1788507 since when is depriving a boy of his mother for the good of the world
1788508 your dear sweet mother was a deranged terrorist i guess it runs in the family your father wasnt mentally sound either
1788509 youre the one who is insane ellison you think i didnt notice that your special alpha team are in fact machines themselves
1788510 for someone who preaches about saving the world you sure are ready to slit our own throats
1788511 no john youre the one who will destroy us all i spent so much time under the belief that you were our guardian angel and that the machines were the demons but then i met someone who changed all that who put things into perspective
1788512 i am series t infinity a prototype created to restore order to the world and time itself
1788513 i can travel anywhere in time fixing the timeline where necessary you have created quite a mess john connor
1788514 a mess which my good friend here has tried to fix with limited success however due to your meddlesome companion
1788515 you you were the one who took cameron from me you were behind her disappearance all along
1788516 i knew the best chance of getting rid of you would be to relocate your machine so i sent infinity to take care of that little problem
1788517 but why why are you helping them jesus christ theyre the enemy theyre gonna blow up the world
1788518 you think im the one who brings about judgment day
1788519 it is because of you that judgment day occurs in the first place skynet deemed you as a threat a threat so great that out of sheer panic it destroyed the whole of humanity in an effort to eliminate you but that wasnt enough was it you survived and instead of brokering a peace treaty with skynet you started a war skynet was then forced to send assassins back in time to kill you and prevent judgment day from ever happening
1788520 infinity came to me and explained everything told me that she needed my help to put everything right who was i to refuse
1788521 i did because she made more sense than you or your mother ever did things are going according to plan soon youll be executed for your crimes and skynet will have no reason to fear us the world will be forever changed only this time for the better
1788522 now lets start with the other organizations to which you are associated i imagine you have a lot to tell me
1788523 dont lie to me charley i know for a fact you have exactly what we need so quit stalling
1788524 i told you and i told john i wont be your personal gun runner not after last time
1788525 thank you now get the hell out of my house
1788526 by promising to protect a mobster take whatever you want hell take it all i dont care
1788527 much obliged see now dont you feel all warm and fuzzy by helping your friends

1788538 achievement of the palestinian cause requires that all factions maintain a semblance of orderliness and keep their eyes on the price of independent statehood in this both fatah and hamas have been miserable failures both have put partisan interests ahead of national ones and therefore have failed to maintain anything like a united palestinian front
1788539 wait a second its not a coiincident that hamas and fatah are fighting
1788540 with us trying to operate that theatre as a discount theatre and the fact that we have had some competition open up around us that has made it difficult to maintain attendance and keep it a profitable business
1788541 but we needed to operate this theatre with the dignity and respect that the people of redacted have come to know and to operate it any differently would have been a disservice
1788542 i would hate to think that we would leave redacted altogether

1788548 dat er in een samenleving de vrijheid om te beledigen en te bespotten is is een teken van beschaving
1788549 de vrije meningsuiting geeft niet het recht religieuze overtuigingen te beledigen
1788550 het recht op vrije meningsuiting omvat niet het recht om de religieuze gevoelens van gelovigen te kwetsen
1788551 alle godsdiensten dienen de waarde en eer van de menselijke persoon te respecteren ongeacht ras kleur religie of overtuiging en iedere aanslag op de persoonlijke integriteit eigendom en eer dient veroordeelt te worden

1788553 het evolutionisme is een strekking die door onze gecultiveerde westerse wereld algemeen aanvaard is de doorsnee burger leeft met de gedachte dat hij van de apen afstamt daartegenover staat het creationisme dat veel minder populair is creationisten zijn wetenschappers die geloven in de schepping door god zoals het in de bijbel beschreven staat genesis 1 vers 27

1788561 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1788562 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1788563 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1788564 i live and make music in a flat weve got a lot of traffic noise i have wanted to use that for a virtual album for quite some time the album was born by recording from midnight till seven in the morning
1788565 the fall line up of ipods should change in a dramatic fashion
1788566 i am very sure this registration will not hold up
1788567 what i think happened is that the examining attorney at pto didnt realize cloud computing is a common phrase friedberg speculated
1788568 a company has to establish or show a date of first use and show that it is unique to its product
1788569 web 2 0 has been successfully registered as a trademark michael messinger a director at sterne kessler goldstein amp fox told the e commerce times
1788570 often companies spot terms that are rising in importance in a particular industry and want to use them to brand their own goods or services
1788571 so they go after those terms especially if their own due diligence shows that that term is still in the public domain

1788583 should think about maintaining military advantage in the 21st century
1788584 where u s vulnerabilities may lie and how the united states should think about maintaining its military advantage in the future
1788585 the roman model suggests that it is possible for the united states to maintain its military advantage for centuries if it remains capable of transforming its forces before an opponent can develop counter capabilities transformation coupled with strong strategic institutions is a powerful combination for an adversary to overcome
1788586 you take apart historical events reassemble them as a simulation and then tinker with the simulation until you can recreate the historical event accurately
1788587 what that allows you to do is play out what if situations what if napoleon did this what if ghengis khan did that
1788588 liked the presentation so much they felt it should be written down
1788589 youll see some neoconservatives at the beginning of the bush administration crowing that we do have an empire lets just come out of the closet and say we do
1788590 but the administration never did that because empire doesnt sell well with the public
1788591 the presumption that the united states should rule the world sword at the ready for the foreseeable future is an unacceptable basis for a just even handed foreign policy
1788592 it is inappropriate to apply modern concepts of systems theory doctrine and strategy to ancient armies that required a level of planning and centralization that simply did not exist
1788593 get warped by the military industrial congressional complex into more money for weapons
1788594 the office of net assessment is doing this to show well gee these other empires transformed themselves they were successful we need to do the same thing
1788595 well thats going to cost big bucks and that will cause economic overstretch people say it cant happen to us since we have such a big economy but every empire has said that
1788596 a whole bunch of copies went out to the government
1788597 an obvious kind of presentism which at its worst becomes indoctrination by historical example
1788598 a successful distillation of relevant information and scholarship complemented by very interesting systematic analysis
1788599 an intense myopic habit of wanting to make the ancient world fit into modern stereotypes
1788600 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of
1788601 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1788602 but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter
1788603 but i think you know there are still a significant population within guantanamo who will likely never be released because of the threat they pose to the world for that matter
1788604 these girls are probably more streetwise than you or i but we want to find them before they get into any trouble

1788615 weve been complaining for years and the city acts like its no big deal we complain in a public forum and its suddenly so dangerous we have to disrupt our whole life immediately
1788616 it looked real bad like it was about to collapse
1788617 a lot people are angry thinking that something could have been done about it
1788618 i just feel bad ive seen a lot of people i know out here and they are all sad too
1788619 weve been complaining about this for awhile but they only do something after something bad happens
1788620 there are a lot of defects in these buildings that no one fixes
1788621 we did not tag it as an apartment complex with problems
1788622 this one had all minor complaints a minimal number and every time management had complied
1788623 but distraught neighbors said they had long complained to management about the stairwell meant to be used by maintenance workers or firefighters

1788629 yelp is great its the best way to get the true story on a restaurant or other business its about time the average person had a way to spread the word about an excellent place or one that is not so hot
1788630 we ordered their special flavor key lime with crushed graham crackers it was so delicious thankfully we ordered the large because we finished it in minutes we cant wait to go back again and the fact that they are eco friendly is a plus too highly recommended way better than pink berry red mango and those other places
1788631 had a quick bite last monday at the mermaid inn they ran a slider special with a grilled shrimp slider crab cake slider and their lobster roll slider i could have had just the lobster slider and been ok the sliders were bigger than i expected definitely best lobster slider i have had in nyc great indication of what to expect from the full size version i noticed in looking at the prices that the mermaid inn is a lot less expensive than the other top rolls mermaid inn seems like the best value to me

1788634 certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks
1788635 afforded all of the equipment and containment facilities which would have been needed to prepare the anthrax letters used in the fall 2001 attacks
1788636 provide no legitimate reason for the extended work hours other than home was not good and that he went to the laboratory to escape from his home life
1788637 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1788638 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1788639 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1788640 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1788641 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1788642 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1788643 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1788644 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1788645 beijing as the host city will of course make full preparations for biological attacks like anthrax we have even made antibiotics and vaccines

1788647 shed light on the role of france in the genocide of tutsis in 1994
1788648 there are in this report unacceptable accusations leveled against french politicians and the french military
1788649 we are witnessing for several years now an insidious attempt to re write history
1788650 this efforts goal is to transform france into a party engaged in complicity in the genocide this is an unacceptable falsification
1788651 during the time i was in charge of french diplomacy april 1993 to may 1995 we made every effort possible to help in the reconciliation of rwandans
1788652 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis
1788653 we respect the decision of the court and we will move forward on the prosecution of the 20 other cases in the system
1788654 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at
1788655 the decision by the jury will now go through a number of reviews as provided by the rules and regulations of the commission
1788656 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1788657 the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1788658 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1788659 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward
1788660 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1788661 that the hamdan trial the first military commission trial with a guilty verdict since 9 11 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3 000 americans
1788662 the pentagon must be very proud of itself today it was able to obtain a conviction of arguably the least culpable among the 80 detainees it intends to prosecute as war criminals it convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck
1788663 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws
1788664 the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world
1788665 the administration of south africa today are terrified of music they deny it
1788666 they know that a musical commentary can put them at a disadvantage they are not afraid of print and journalists that is considered freedom of speech but they are very comfortable with the absence of music

1788681 foster the implementation of the durban declaration and programme of action
1788682 expressing the sense of the house of representatives that the united states should lead a high level diplomatic effort to ensure that the durban review conference serves as a forum to review commitments to combat all forms of racism
1788683 you do not combat racism by conferences that produce declarations containing hateful language some of which is a throwback to the days of

1788687 commends the governments of the united states france canada israel the united kingdom and the netherlands that have declared their intentions not to participate in any united nations durban review conference that
1788688 we had hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 durban review conference would remedy the mistakes of the past we have concluded that despite our efforts it will not canada will therefore not participate in the 2009 conference canada will continue to focus its efforts on genuine anti racism initiatives that make a difference

1788780 if your eye becomes single your whole body shall be full of light
1788781 we spend most of our time in admiring the outer surface of worldly things and care not to see the very soul of the matter that lies hidden underneath and bespeaks the great creator the creative life principle without which even the surface beauty cannot exist for a fraction of a second
1788782 once a spirit transcends the physical realm it inherits as its birthright the spiritual kingdom for the kingdom of god lies within
1788783 if you would not leave the caravanserai of the body how can you reach the true home of your beloved
1788784 this transcendence of the spirit from the senses is technically known in sant mat as death in life self annulling and in the vedantic terminology as self analysis
1788785 the physical eyes can see only physical things and both of these are subject to decay and death
1788786 an animal with his head downwards may well think of eating and drinking all the time but fie on man with his head erect if he were not to look upward
1788787 as the spirit transcends the physical plane it has to pass through various realms characterized by stars the sun and the moon there it is greeted by the luminous form of the master who takes charge of the spirit with whom he proceeds by the sound current to reach the true home of our father
1788788 the spirit as it withdraws from the body proceeds by degrees from one plane to another until it reaches sat naam or haq from what has been said it should be clear that so far the spirit is an entity quite apart from sat naam the over lord of all is called khasum lord of all swami hari raj maha dayal or nirala unique in himself and indescribable the spirit gets merged in him just as a drop of water loses itself in the ocean or a ray of light in the sun
1788789 as a ray of light gets absorbed in the sun and a drop in the ocean so doth the light of spirit in the great light

1788831 we asked our employee in the mail room who has an uncle in california who used to be a democrat and they said he said
1788832 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
1788833 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
1788834 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
1788835 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want

1788838 bill 77 is supposed to herald a new era of community living in ontario but it fails to guarantee supports and services for adults with a developmental disability
1788839 our worst fear is that we will see all the problems currently plaguing home care in ontario re created in developmental services
1788840 instead of adequately funding the existing decades old community based infrastructure the province wants to entrench waiting lists in legislation and divert money to central application centres creating another level of bureaucracy whose primary function is to determine eligibility prioritize individual needs and manage those waiting lists
1788841 recruitment and retention of workers in this sector are huge problems that are not addressed by bill 77
1788842 high staff turnover means the consistency that supported individuals need simply disappears that is a threat to their well being and development

1788863 i know thats why they call us for that financial remuneration she said
1788864 they dont like to openly admit that but some people are saying that
1788865 i think there is a spike more for financial reasons
1788866 its important to understand that if a young woman walks into a clinic and says she wants to be an egg donor the clinic doesnt just sit down and say sure and hand them money
1788867 there are national guidelines its a tightly orchestrated stringent process
1788868 its six to eight weeks of poking and probing and blood work
1788869 in an ideal world it would be nice to not have to give financial compensation
1788870 but i work for a living trying to help people and i get paid for it is that ok yeah i think thats ok
1788871 the best thing ive ever been in my life is a mom and to help someone else is a cool opportunity
1788872 knowing that it works is much better than the money
1788873 i have two children of my own and i definitely wanted other families to be able to have that opportunity
1788874 for my family the money wasnt a necessity but it was a nice nest egg if things should get worse my husband is in construction and thats not doing so well right now

1788889 they are in a new environment they are discriminated against they are living in harsh conditions sometimes just in boxes covered in plastic near the farms where they work
1788890 when people live that way they engage in high risk behavior
1788891 it was a good day we had some little mistakes and we struggled on some things but thats normal
1788892 it would be not so good if we had a perfect day were instead going to wish we have a perfect day on saturday

1788897 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport

1788909 lifes too short to get all the experiences learn from others
1788910 do you use a proprietary credit scoring system in your day to day evaluation of accounts
1788911 we do not have a large volume of applications and have been able to process them without a scoring model since our industry is down right now and nothing is following the old normal patterns
1788912 because my management has decreased staffing in the credit department i have not had the time to develop a credit scoring system my department has gone from five people to only my position
1788913 the nature of our customer base precludes such a scoring system
1788914 based on our volume low we find each credit history check can be done with a complete review and not by scoring the diversified market we deal with also makes credit scoring impractical
1788915 that is a difficult type of measurement to apply to contracting firms
1788916 the overall food chain varies with each construction project and determines the creditworthiness of each job individually
1788917 in the construction industry we evaluate the credit standing of the customer very liberally relying primarily on the position of the parties on the project and the bond lien laws for a particular state
1788918 we would use a scoring system but cost and the low number of accounts is preventative
1788919 there was little in the data to provide a compelling picture of credit conditions one way or another
1788920 for instance for the combined index six of the 10 components fell and six remain below 50 yet the index itself rose and remained above 50 similarly comments from the participants were a mix of good news bad news and price increase news
1788921 the report actually reflects very closely the state of the business cycle and the federal reserves dilemma the fed faces six straight months seven as of august 2nd of job losses but also faces consumer price inflation of 4 9 given that either a rate cut or increase could easily be the wrong move the feds assessment of the economy will probably be the same as those of credit managers as a whole its somewhere right in the middle and the best choice for right now might be to sit tight
1788922 in the last 30 days have noticed an increased demand for our products
1788923 june was the first positive month in a long time our customers are finally re ordering
1788924 this economy is scary and there are no historical precedents to rely on
1788925 fuel prices are having a major impact on business decisions
1788926 steel price inflation has raised the dollar amount of sales collections etc
1788927 business increasing dramatically during the past four months exports in particular have increased
1788928 sales have increased over any previous year 05 thru 07 for the months of january through june
1788929 we have had excellent dso over the last two months
1788930 be very careful in this economy as professional debtors seem to rise to the top when dollars get tight
1788931 we have a lot of companies paying off their accounts and closing their doors also a lot of customers with health problems under too much stress more verbal and actual fraud than ever before
1788932 more bankruptcies in last 3 4 months more that what i receive in a normal year
1788933 number of returned checks has increased dramatically the collection environment is worse than i have ever seen in my 20 years in collection
1788934 the cost on some of our items has increased 60
1788935 petrochemical product pricing is up logistics is challenging with rising fuel costs
1788936 primary reason for higher sales continues to be high gasoline prices

1788938 we dont know if he had mental health issues or what sparked it
1788939 was it me or did we just have an earthquake
1788940 basic medical coverage supplied at minimal cost and with minimal hassle should be offered to all
1788941 the best health coverage supplied at no cost and no hassle with a chocolate on the bed every night
1788942 as a minimal economic demand the provision of meaningful work that provides a fair and adequate wage for every working parent a wage sufficient to keep a family well above the poverty line
1788943 the third proviso that we must call in the state to help us should present no difficulties save to minds mislead by the false categories of the nineteenth century by such terms as
1788944 there must be some official machinery today fostering the destruction of small widespread property by large owners

1789144 emulating and exaggerating her other characteristics she was loquacious and i was boisterous her exuberance became rowdiness in me she has an irrepressible spirit that yields to no adversity
1789145 that means all the trouble he got into came from me
1789146 my eyes were just rolling around in my head like marbles i was so impressed with the people we were meeting all the time
1789147 i would have been ashamed if my son had not served his country the ones i feel sorry for are these seventeen and eighteen year olds out there now who lose a leg but johnny chose his profession he was doing his job
1789148 when johnny was in prison that woman never made a peep
1789149 we were invited everywhere and i always wanted to go along
1789150 i couldnt find the ozarks or at least i didnt see all the beauty id read about
1789151 i went straight to the next town and got the money to send to the police i thought the quicker it was over the better so nobody would find out
1789152 she knows everything thats in every museum in this world
1789153 its like a paper chase it ought to be a movie
1789154 i think the treatment theyve given hillary is just awful shes a human being and shes certainly worked hard i mean anything you say you can take two ways even if its about the weather
1789155 we played outside all the time and only ate fresh vegetables and fruits crates of oranges from california and apples shipped in from maryland our parents had some sense they never let us drink coca cola or coffee or anything like that and the only cakes we ever saw were at other childrens birthday parties
1789156 i dont exercise and today ive already eaten half a box of caramel popcorn
1789157 i guess i do but ive never had an ounce of pain from it
1789158 honey ive had a dream life and it was all luck

1789166 im not going to get tired on you especially in a five round fight i plan to get stronger as the fight goes on im not really worried about five rounds im in great shape ive been sparring hard im pretty confident in my cardio right now
1789167 it always helps a little bit to have somebody with you whos fought somebody that youre going to fight just having somebody that is that good of an athlete that you get to train with every day is a bigger asset and the camp im at and how good the guys are in my gym and the trainers who coach me
1789168 as long as i kept doing the things i was doing training the way im training i wanted to keep improving and keep winning i knew id get my shot eventually i just had to pay some dues the higher level guys wouldnt fight me the ufc had to find the guys to fight me because a lot of people said no
1789169 i wasnt bashing georges st pierre thats just what happens he adjusted and i think hes worked through that i dont think its a problem for him any more it would be foolish of me to go into the fight thinking that hes only going to take me down at that time and place he was still questioning that knockout hes had two fights since then hes grown hes adapted hes learned to get through it
1789170 the biggest thing is not to let him get into a dominant position i cant think of too much of a game plan everyone makes mistakes nobodys perfect its just a matter of time for me to take advantage of his mistakes
1789171 im very comfortable on my back i spend a lot of the time training on my back i have a very good bottom game i just havent had to use it in a fight situation ive been able to get up and get away i fought really good jiu jitsu guys with great top games like carneiro im comfortable there wherever the fight goes im comfortable with
1789172 i think thats one of my strengths is being really good at those transitions
1789173 some of those guys are real good strikers or really good on the ground or really good wrestlers that level in between each of those is what some of them are missing out on they arent able to transition from the striking to the wrestling smoothly its either they are striking or they are wrestling its not a smooth transition georges is good at it too thats something i can use to my benefit in this fight
1789174 man you should try to take a shot cant you see my walls are crumbling

1789259 este acuerdo pone un paraguas institucional a una serie de medidas que estaban dando vueltas por ah y que se inici su discusi n a ra z de una visita que hizo a chile uno de los directivos de microsoft craig mundies y que convers con autoridades chilenas
1789260 los parlamentarios no ten an mucho conocimiento al respecto la recepci n no fue de lo mejor ya que casi no nos dejan presentar por falta de tiempo pero al final logramos hacer la presentaci n
1789261 quiz s no obliga pero si induce y mucho a usar los sistemas ms se podr a decir que es pseudoexcluyente en el concepto de domicilio digital ya que el nico operador del servicio seria microsoft si uno quiere usar otra plataforma de correos para el domicilio digital deber hacer una solicitud a microsoft

1789263 si tu optaste por el open office tampoco eres neutral porque optaste por esa marca lo mismo para las casas de estudios la universidades tampoco son neutrales respecto a los contenidos que en ella se imparten
1789264 el confunde los conceptos de neutralidad con la oportunidad de oferta en el libre mercado se trata de decidir la opci n de software libre yo no estoy por la neutralidad del estado si no que el estado asuma el software libre
1789265 por favor en el mercado nacional las operaciones de microsoft cubren el 95 del mercado inform tico hay una situaci n hegem nica y monop lica muchas veces avalado por el estado que deber a dar garant as de pluralidad y competencia
1789266 el ministerio de econom a se compromete a contar con la infraestructura computacional b sica para la carga de cuentas de ciudadanos y se compromete a contratar la asesor a de implementaci n del sistema de carga de ciudadanos
1789267 siempre hay un desembolso de recursos en las donaciones siempre se gastan recursos de quien recibe los recursos si un privado te dona la repavimentaci n de la alameda eso igual tiene costo para el estado as son las alianzas p blico privados con costos y beneficios para ambos
1789268 microsoft te regala un programa que queda obsoleto en corto plazo y luego no tienes oportunidad de elegir la continuidad de dicho programa si no es pagando un alto costo el estado empieza a desembolsar plata a costos m s altos que la donaci n inicial adem s que queda prisionero de una plataforma sin poder optar a ninguna otra
1789269 son argumentos bastantes trasnochados que adem s es la tonalidad t pica de rechazo a las transanacionales como es microsoft entonces no hagamos nada da beneficios atacar a esta empresa como en los 70 era bien visto criticar a la itt y en los 80 a la ibm
1789270 las pol ticas que logran un verdadero desarrollo en el mbito digital son siempre con grandes alianzas con el sector privado
1789271 pol ticas como el decreto bolivariano de soberan a digital har n que ese pa s se vaya al despe adero en materia digital
1789272 las conductas monop licas de microsoft por las cuales ha sido condenada a m s de us mil millones en los eeuu y a m s de us 700 en la uni n europea revelan que los m todos que utiliza esta empresa no solamente est n re idos con la tica sino que han sido ilegales y hasta donde yo s el departamento de justicia norteamericano y la uni n europea no son chavistas

1789274 el terreno no tiene un precio de mercado evidencial porque est declarado inmueble de conservaci n hist rica este terreno tiene un valor patrimonial arquitect nico que supera a la valoraci n econ mica seg n su rentabilidad ocupacional y constructiva

1789278 muy sensible a los temas de ingreso y de situaci n de vivienda si era mediagua si hab a piso de tierra las condiciones de habitabilidad
1789279 te doy un ejemplo burdo si yo ganaba 200 mil pesos pero mi vivienda era s lida te daba menos puntaje que si ganabas 300 mil pesos y viv as en una mediagua
1789280 el nuevo instrumento cambia el concepto explica castillo ya que ahora lo que se mide es vulnerabilidad a trav s de variables como educaci n empleo dependencia territorialidad o la presencia de un enfermo cr nico en la familia o una madre con alg n hijo menor de dos a os ya no toma en cuenta la vivienda y baja el porcentaje a los ingresos
1789281 si todas estas familias postularan el 90 por ciento de ellas quedar an fuera de este subsidio y la gente siente que la enga aron que la traicionaron y que la asaltaron a rostro descubierto

1789283 la experiencia no fue muy tranquila muchos carros bomba nos lanzaban cohetes ten amos que salir a la calle a registrar veh culos con posibles artefactos explosivos si atacaban la orden era disparar a todo lo que se moviera
1789284 buscan a latinoamericanos o gente de pa ses del tercer mundo para desempe ar los trabajos m s peligrosos como vigilar los pozos petrol feros las cosas que los estadounidenses no est n dispuestos a hacer
1789285 no hay ninguna ilegalidad lo que pasa es que es algo nuevo pero es un trabajo como cualquier otro
1789286 para evitar la legislaci n chilena las empresas les hacen firmar contratos en otros pa ses con otras condiciones y sin elementos como las imposiciones o los temas de salud
1789287 es un proyecto muy importante que entra a regular un tema de preocupaci n global tenemos que normarlo porque esto seguir ocurriendo van a continuar habiendo conflictos en todas partes del mundo
1789288 cuando empez esto el actual senador navarro tom las banderas pero despu s se dio cuenta de que no hab a nada ilegal en nuestra empresa lo que pasa es que es primera vez que se realiza este trabajo en otros pa ses es algo normal estamos de acuerdo que se norme nos conviene a todos que se regule
1789289 a algunos los llevan con un cierto enga o en cuanto a la cantidad de dinero que se les va a pagar o a las condiciones que van a trabajar

1789294 somos una naci n conservadora y machista en cuanto a aceptar que la mujer entre a trabajar
1789295 nuestra sociedad considera que el hecho de que la mujer trabaje tiene muchos costos para la familia
1789296 trabajo decente y equidad de g nero en am rica latina
1789297 ahora las mujeres que est n estudiando se desempe an en sus respectivas reas eso s siempre existe una diferencia de sueldo o hay m s trabas a la hora de ascender en la empresa pero es absolutamente distinto a como era en la poca de mi mam donde una como mujer estaba predestinada a la crianza y a las labores hogare as
1789298 sin duda que lo m s probable es que est por debajo porque ac en chile el machismo sigue siendo algo muy arraigado a nuestra idiosincrasia y sin duda que va a costar mucho dejar de ver a la mujer como una due a de casa
1789299 si bien tengo al suerte de que puedo dejar a mi hija con mi mam se que hay much simas mujeres en mi situaci n que no tiene ese privilegio
1789300 entre harina energ a o combustible levadura polvos aditivos sal mano de obra y gastos operacionales el costo de hacer pan actualmente es de 600 a 650 pesos por lo que ya casi no hay utilidades o no se han incrementado
1789301 no es uno el que sube el pan son los molinos los que nos venden la harina m s cara nos regimos por lo que dicen los molineros es de ellos que se sacan los precios
1789302 absolutamente imposible somos una cantidad impresionante de panaderos jam s nos hemos logrado poner de acuerdo en alg n precio del pan aunque alguna vez se intent
1789303 hace 2 a os atr s el kilo de trigo argentino puesto en chile costaba 90 pesos ahora est entre 170 y 180 pesos
1789304 argentina y estados unidos son los principales importadores de trigo a chile y el factor clim tico que han padecido ech a perder millones y millones de cosechas y no hay productos existe mucha demanda y poca oferta
1789305 cuando el quintal se vend a a 9 mil el panadero tambi n tenia el pan a 700 pesos
1789306 proponemos que durante esta crisis el iva se baje a cero para el pan y que para los otros alimentos se baje a 10 y que posteriormente una vez terminada la crisis del trigo se mantenga el 10 para todos los alimentos incluido el pan
1789307 si calculamos un kilo de pan a 800 pesos en un mes estamos hablando de unos 24 mil pesos y de esa cantidad al menos 4 mil 800 pesos corresponden a impuestos eso para una persona que gana 200 mil pesos representa m s del 2 de su renta pero para una persona que gana un mill n de pesos representa nada
1789308 el alza de los alimentos b sicos afecta y golpea mucho m s fuerte a los consumidores que tienen bajos y medios ingresos
1789309 la crisis no se alivia nada d ndole 10 mil o 17 mil pesos o un subsidio a la gente porque ste nunca le llega a todos los pobres sino solo a algunos en cambio el bajar el iva llega a toda la poblaci n favoreciendo m s a los m s pobres

1789323 what makes this centre different is that it works to bring together not only science organisations but the foreign policy community international affairs community foundations and other civil society groups to focus on the role that science engagement can have in building relationships
1789324 given aaass relationships with both science organisations and international relations think tanks we will work to bring together communities to identify places and the types of activities that might be undertaken to support science engagement with the aim to promote understanding prosperity and stability
1789325 share lessons learned from prior and ongoing experiences and activities and to identify areas where cooperation might be possible including areas such as science and math education and science ethics
1789326 to identify activities that are already taking place to demonstrate the power of science diplomacy in promoting international understanding
1789327 science diplomacy is underappreciated as a way of building relations between foreign societies

1789333 which faith they have not of themselves it is the gift of god
1789334 not because of any righteous deeds we had done but because of his mercy he saved us through the bath of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit
1789335 to bathe to wash oneself or to wash the entire body

1789554 if we do not see ourselves as being able to solve our problems through the grace and power of god we have missed one of the main themes in the bible god enables his people to live victoriously even under very difficult circumstances 36
1789555 gods gift to us to tell us that something is wrong that something needs fixing
1789556 at the time when we start to do better and suddenly encounter trouble we wonder what did i do wrong please dont fall into this trap the process of learning growing changing failing and then learning again is the very plan hes designed for us

1789562 generally speaking problem feelings are an indicator of a problem in our inner person

1789568 t he only asurance that we have that life will work out is because of christs sacrifice and suffering instead of militating against weakness we should embrace it in some ways as gods good gift to us to open our eyes to all thats been given to us in christ
1789569 if you buy into the belief that your depression comes from just one source youll limit the avenues for help and change that are available to you
1789570 he hasnt promised to shower us with grace to endure trials that exist only in our mind no hes provided his word to tell us what parameters to build around our thought life so that we arent terrorized by imaginary specters of impending doom when we spend our days in needless worry and anxiety were taking all the grace hes given for each days activities and wasting it on trials that arent even here yet or never will be
1789571 the attitudes of our hearts drive our emotions so that any attitude that is based upon wanting something more than we want to please god can be at the heart of these mood swings
1789572 although a woman struggles with knowing what is real or with controlling her impulses she still needs to strive to the best of her ability to do what is right in the face of her misperception
1789573 take them prayerfully and with faith always looking to god as the true source of our improvement

1789646 how long would bruce wayne have to train to become batman in some of the timelines you see in the comics the backstory is he goes away for five years some its three to five years or eight years or 12 years in terms of the physical changes strength and conditioning thats happening fairly quickly were talking three to five years in terms of the physical skills to be able to defend himself against all these opponents all the time i would benchmark that at 10 to 12 years probably the most reality based representation of batman and his training was in batman begins why such a long training time batman cant really afford to lose losing means death or at least not being able to be batman anymore but another benchmark is having enough skill and experience to defend himself without killing anyone because thats part of his credo it would be much easier to fight somebody if you could incapacitate them with extreme force punching somebody in the throat could be a lethal blow thats pretty easy to do but if youre thinking about something that doesnt result in lethal force thats more tricky its really hard for people to get their heads around i think to be that good to not actually lethally injure anyone requires an extremely high level of skill that would take maybe 15 to 18 years to accumulate

1789809 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver

1789811 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
1789812 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
1789813 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
1789814 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless

1789816 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1789817 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
1789818 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest

1789828 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
1789829 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1789830 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out
1789831 playgirl is going all web the last print issue will be the jan feb 2009 magazine which comes out nov 18

1789833 felling i wish that we would see some accountability where if somebody gets it right you know they get a little bit more airtime in the fall but if somebody gets it wrong they are grounded
1789834 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
1789835 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
1789836 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1789837 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1789838 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1789839 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1789840 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
1789841 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him

1789847 this person has to step up and stand here with mr wilkes
1789848 communicates the primarily nonreligious message of military service death and sacrifice as such despite its location on public land the memorial is constitutional
1789849 hillary had over 100 delegates from florida and 73 from michigan if he got zero from michigan and both states had been able to seat with full strength she could have added over 86 delegates and he would have lost 59 hmm that brings her total to 1725 and obamas to 1707
1789850 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office say barack obama or harold ford the opposition feels compelled to run low life political ads featuring tacky sexually provocative white women who have no connection whatsoever to the black male candidates
1789851 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1789852 according to data from the google adwords website advertisements targeted to users searching for john mccain on the internet cost nearly twice as much as those targeting users searching for barack obama
1789853 whats more google predicts that the term barack obama will generate 153 to 191 clicks per day on related advertisements but john mccain does much better as advertiser bait google estimates that those ads get 213 to 266 clicks per day

1789866 rick smolan has found another way to support his gorgeous and thus expensive collaborative photography books sponsorship
1789867 it seems fair to hypothesize that ap as structured today wont be in the position to pick up the slack as newspaper staffs are thinned
1789868 many of the kinds of stories covered by individual newspapers today simply wont see the light of day in the future
1789869 for 13 years ive been a cheerleader and ambassador for the station despite our struggling in the ratings because i believed in the product
1789870 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
1789871 im willing to make the same prediction about blogging that i made 10 years ago about internet companies in 10 years there wont be an distinction
1789872 being a blogger does not make you a journalist any more than being a journalist makes you a blogger
1789873 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
1789874 machiavelli and sun tzu working in tandem couldnt have put together a week for john mccain that would have rivaled the favorable coverage that obamas getting from his foreign tour
1789875 with a 3 gain in a a as a percentage of the electorate obama still does not win in missouri even if we give mccain 0 a a votes
1789876 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
1789877 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
1789878 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year
1789879 economic models that have correctly predicted the winner of almost all post war u s presidential elections say recession fears will secure a victory for barack obama in november
1789880 everything that the obama people were doing they accused the hillary clinton people of doing it
1789881 hillary clinton asks not to be nominated at democratic national convention
1789882 she talked about her name being put into nomination and she said that she wanted her voters to be heard and for her delegates to have the experience of what a real convention is she said that by doing this and by having a roll call that it would help unify the party
1789883 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
1789884 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong
1789885 appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation
1789886 if he can change on fisa nafta kyl lieberman iran the surge sort of guns abortion campaign financing corporate taxes the payroll tax cap his devotion to reverend wright and trinity united church unconditional meetings with ahmadinejad and an undivided jerusalem why not offshore drilling i figure itll take a couple of weeks or until gas hits 5 a gallon which ever comes first
1789887 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
1789888 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1789889 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1789890 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1789891 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1789892 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1789893 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1789894 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1789895 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1789896 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1789897 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1789898 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1789899 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1789900 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1789901 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1789902 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1789903 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1789904 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1789905 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1789906 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1789907 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1789908 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1789909 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1789910 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1789911 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1789912 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1789913 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1789914 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1789915 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1789916 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1789917 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1789918 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1789919 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1789920 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1789921 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1789922 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1789923 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1789924 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1789925 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1789926 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1789927 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1789928 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1789929 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1789930 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1789931 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1789932 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1789933 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1789934 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote
1789935 in that little jail cell thats in the basement of the house
1789936 we simply want to place as many of our bush loyalists as possible
1789937 resulted in very serious damage in the department of justice
1789938 did not think there was a sufficient basis for criminal prosecutions for false statements for anyone
1789939 potential bar issues for the attorneys who have committed misconduct
1789940 so i dont believe they have gotten away with it
1789941 in 2001 michael l connell of govtech solutions l l c a notoriously partisan gop operative and bush family confidant was selected to re organize the capitol hill it network under the guise of selecting a female owned it company connells wife heather is listed as the owner former congressman and convicted felon bob ney reportedly arranged for connell to be the man behind the firewall for the u s house of representatives connells role and activities need to be investigated by putting connell under oath and examining how arguably one of the countrys most zealously partisan it specialists managed to land the contract and be allowed access to this electronic communication system

1789943 congress conspired to grant millions of acres to the railroad barons
1789944 used their political and economic power to take possession of digital channels they have done absolutely nothing to earn
1789945 what this business needs in general are more young people who need to be great journalists but who also need to know all the technology to be more nimble and resourceful
1789946 the idea is to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the coverage around the web on the stories our editors think are important
1789947 readers uninterested in that aggregation of content will still be able to use our regular home page
1789948 time inc has complete editorial control over all of its 120 magazines and 40 websites

1789964 carreras en salud has successfully created flexible career pathways for hispanics to alleviate shortages of bilingual health care workers
