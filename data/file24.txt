240017 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
240018 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
240019 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
240020 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
240021 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
240022 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

240045 every man has two sides to him whether its the emotional side or the tough side or whatever whether you choose to show it or hide it he was just a cat who caught my emotional side of things at the end of the day it was a heart felt conversation for me i meant everything i said i was actually going through a situation at the time but he chose to put it out there to like discredit me but i think it backfired

240057 das ist nicht einmal ein prozent mehr als das angebot von ver di

240059 das ergebnis war keinen streik wert denn wegen der hohen inflation bleibt da nicht viel brig
240060 500 euro hat mich der streik gekostet das hole ich erst nach jahren wieder rein
240061 und alles nur weil ich aus solidarit t zu den anderen mitgestreikt habe
240062 in stuttgart hamburg und frankfurt sind die techniker ebenfalls stinksauer
240063 die technik hat gezeigt dass sie streikf hig ist wir sollten deshalb in zukunft getrennt von den anderen bereichen verhandeln
240064 das ist eine gute idee bleibt abzuwarten was dabei rauskommt
240065 id like to take you back with all the hoopla all the publicity that has surrounded the company i think there has been a great deal of misinformation

240068 this is by far the most significant improvement in product safety since the consumer product safety commission was created in the 1970s
240069 im a mom myself and this gives me additional assurances
240070 our childrens health and safety is too important to rush through product restrictions without understanding their full consequences
240071 restricting phthalates from childrens products when they have been deemed safe for use in those products by the cpsc will do nothing to protect childrens health
240072 youre hearing the songs in the moment with the energy of everyone playing together
240073 we allowed ourselves the time to rewrite as we saw fit
240074 the sophomore album was written more or less in about two weeks if you added up all the days we actually wrote this one we stretched over an entire year
240075 not let me tell you about my boyfriend its not puppy love although there is some fun and levity on this record
240076 steve earle steve earle please write a song for me
240077 its in the understanding of loss and pain and in the stories and specific songs
240078 i believe that an artist has an ethos that attracts a fan ours is intricately woven into our need to express ourselves as songwriters
240079 i also think you try harder connect deeper and play better when you wrote the song you are singing
240080 i think they have such a good sense of themselves
240081 they know who they are and they have a good vision for where they want to go with their music i think theyve just made an awful lot of good moves in their career
240082 on the first one we knew we were good songwriters but we didnt know we were good country songwriters
240083 if i can interpret it if youve got a small company in israel who doesnt have a pervasive workforce around the world maybe theyve got two major markets for their product so they rely on the technology because they dont have as many people on the ground
240084 you cant be lazy with these systems the worst sin in intelligence is that someone hands you an analysis and you dont explore the cause of that analysis
240085 its not as if the technology is going to change a companys direction but it will help shape how they view the world
240086 when these packages work well theyre very good at filtering the noise out of the marketplace for management
240087 ten years ago they were pretty much desk jockey packages you bought a seat or three seats and the competitive intelligence group managed their database more of the packages today are being sold to broader sections of the company

240101 when i called him on thursday he told me he had played golf at the us club i told him you must be the only mad chap to play in all the muck its a shock to us
240102 he had called me to his home to discuss the possibilty i couldnt go as i went abroad i an regretting i couldnt go
240103 to me ashok was a natural leader he had the qualities to lead india we followed him like a pck because he was respected by all of us ever since school ashok was huge name to us and in his passing away we have lost a true friend

240105 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
240106 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
240107 oh my god can i come and work for you people
240108 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
240109 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
240110 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
240111 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
240112 if khaleda zia is released there will be no division in the party and it will contest the next election unitedly
240113 i believe bnp will unite the unity of nationalist forces is urgent
240114 i have submitted a reform proposal to make the party stronger and more acceptable to the people but the proposal is nothing final
240115 our chairperson khaleda zia was also in favour of reform she is now in jail
240116 we have been deployed here to provide security cover for the vip arrival
240117 it is a matter for the government when the local elections should be held
240118 i think there is a high degree of commitment by the government to hold elections in time
240119 it may be necessary to do that as the issue is ensuring safety and the same time holding free fair and credible polls

240123 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
240124 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards

240127 i express my gratitude to the people of bangladesh and my party
240128 a kuwait airlines fight brought 27 bangladeshi workers back to dhaka this morning at 5am
240129 of the deportees 13 held bangladesh passports and the rest were issued out passes and put on a homebound plane
240130 dr iftekhar ahmed chowdhury was told by maldivian foreign minister abdullah shahid that maldives was keen to have more semi skilled and skilled bangladeshi labour for their growing tourism sector
240131 the standard is the tasteless labour flavor of the hollow men but at least the spin and lies pouring out of national win votes for the party while the wretched drones at the standard makes even a long term left wing voter like me recoil in disgust
240132 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
240133 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
240134 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
240135 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
240136 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
240137 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
240138 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
240139 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
240140 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
240141 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
240142 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
240143 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
240144 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

240147 as owners and creativity are core elements of scion we wanted to generate an advertising campaign that integrated those aspects in an innovative way
240148 we think the united by individuality campaign will engage our owners as well as show others what the brand is about i cant wait for owners to be surprised when they see their cars in their favorite magazines on a billboard or at the movies
240149 yes our vehicles are polarizing but we are confident our united by individuality campaign will spark positive conversation among scion enthusiasts each vehicle in the campaign is so unique owners will know who a vehicle belongs to or reach out to the scion community to find out our owners are definitely united by individuality and we will continue to support them as they tell us what the brand needs to be
240150 we will maintain our course for adventurous and authentic marketing efforts
240151 were scion and thats what we do to stand out and engage consumers

240156 haben sich travis weltweit als feste rockgr e etabliert doch nach ber 10 millionen verkauften alben wurde es zeit f r eine neudefinition f r die schottische band
240157 wir hatten f r bbc radio 2 einen song f r den 40 jahrestag von sergeant pepper aufgenommen zusammen mit dem alten tontechniker der beatles
240158 das hat uns wahnsinnig inspiriert an unserem vorherigen album hatten wir zwei jahre gem tlich gearbeitet aber in den 60ern stellten bands ihre platten innerhalb weniger wochen fertig
240159 also kaufte ich eine alte fender jazzmaster und einen klassischen vox ac30 verst rker und beschloss das album auf der e gitarre zu schreiben das hatten wir seit unserer ersten platte nicht mehr gemacht so ziemlich alle songs entstanden in diesen sessions im proberaum
240160 wir wollten dass dieses album ein paar ecken und kanten hat ich liebe alle unsere alben aber in der vergangenheit war unser sound so glatt dass man fast darauf ausrutschen konnte das ist diesmal nicht der fall wir haben uns wirklich angetrieben es ist prog pop da passiert so viel innerhalb der 3 min tigen songs
240161 wir nahmen analog auf 16 track auf was allgemein als der beste sound gilt
240162 der haken ist dass man fast alles live einspielen muss wenn man nur 16 spuren hat
240163 das h tten wir zu anfang unserer karriere gar nicht hingekriegt
240164 aber ich denke mit zw lf jahren banderfahrung hat unser spiel die n tige sicherheit
240165 were going to start shooting in a couple months we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet
240166 we actually got approached about doing it by multiple people it was one of those things where we were like wow lets totally do it i think its sort of a fun way to show the other side of celebrity and a sort of semi normal life
240167 the truth is that amy ended up in hospital this week because she mixed up the medication that shes taking to help her come off drugs
240168 being diagnosed with the early stage of emphysema was a real jolt a wake up call
240169 if the girl wants to have an orgasm probably 95 per cent will

240174 its a collage of everything that happened for world youth day

240178 vivimos en un momento donde unos rechazan la religi n que les han ense ado y otros se quedan a medio camino
240179 un ser humano autoconsciente choca con los l mites de la existencia y se pregunta si son la ltima realidad esto forma parte de la misma constituci n humana las creencias en el fondo lo que tratan de aportar es sosiego tranquilidad y un cierto equilibrio emocional otra cosa es el precio que se paga para obtener esa tranquilidad
240180 en parte s opina s daba puesto que todo lo que hacemos tiene su ltima ra z en los genes y en parte no porque las creencias son sistemas socioculturales que nos transmitimos a lo largo de la historia es peligroso en cualquier caso reducir todo a los genes por condicionantes que stos sean
240181 dios es un sustantivo argumenta un concepto que inventamos para designar una dimensi n de la realidad que percibimos
240182 una dimensi n divina de la realidad que esa dimensi n divina se vuelve consciente al menos en el hombre que el ser humano es el encargado de dar sentido a esa realidad que en l emergen las cualidades personales y libres de la existencia y tambi n la verdad la bondad y la belleza en su sentido estricto en el ser humano se prolonga la acci n creadora de la divinidad y por ello afirmo que la realidad entera est bajo su cuidado
240183 las creencias tratan de aportar sosiego tranquilidad equilibrio emocional otra cosa es el precio que hay que pagar por ello
240184 explicar salvar ordenar sas son las tres funciones precisa marina que la religi n se ha esforzado en realizar sus grandes proyectos para conseguirlo ha puesto en juego todas sus capacidades de invenci n met fora razonamiento y voluntad
240185 la religi n apunta jos antonio marina se transmite y se acepta dentro del sistema de creencias sociales admitido por una cultura
240186 vivimos en un momento expone el te logo donde unos rechazan la religi n que les han ense ado y otros se quedan a medio camino sin llegar a ning n tipo de conclusi n durante el franquismo se vivi una religi n muy coactiva exteriorista superficial esto atrae poco y produjo adem s reacciones contrarias mientras los mayores mantienen inc lumes sus creencias hay muchos j venes que se han apartado del cristianismo y que buscan respuesta a sus necesidades espirituales en otras fuentes
240187 con frecuencia asegura marina los adultos no creen en lo que aprendieron de ni os pero tampoco pueden dejar de creer porque parte de su afectividad est profundamente ligada a esas creencias por decirlo con un ejemplo muy burdo se puede no creer en dios pero seguir temiendo el castigo eterno o se puede no ser cristiano pero continuar emocion ndose con la virgen de su cofrad a
240188 a los dioses antiguos comenta s daba se van sumando tambi n las nuevas religiones
240189 porque la cultura en el fondo asegura marina es una interpretaci n de la realidad de unos valores que quedar n impresos en cada uno de nosotros unos valores que nunca se llegan a pensar s lo se viven
240190 la sociedad legitima las creencias religiosas y en un proceso circular muy frecuente en estos asuntos utiliza a su vez la religi n como gran legitimadora
240191 la rebeli n moderna contra la religi n advierte s daba ha consistido en liberar a la moral de la religi n la tica es aut noma y no tiene por qu buscarse un fundamento fuera las religiones sin embargo han intentado justificar desde ellas mismas la moral es l gico puesto que de esta manera se completa el dominio sobre el entendimiento y sobre la voluntad s lo a adir a que intereses los hay por todas partes y que encontrar una moral realmente desinteresada es verdaderamente excepcional y admirable
240192 explicar salvar ordenar esas son las tres funciones que la religi n se ha esforzado en realizar
240193 se ponen a salvo del gran sumidero en que puede convertirse el mar de la realidad
240194 crear es sacudir la inercia explica el fil sofo mantener a pulso la libertad nadar contracorriente cuidar el estilo decir una palabra amable defender un derecho inventar un chiste hacer un regalo re rse de uno mismo tomarse muy en serio las cosas serias todo esto es el tema de la tica que no es una meditaci n sobre el destino sino una meditaci n sobre c mo burlarse del destino es decir del determinismo de la rutina de la maldad y del tedio
240195 es la participaci n del ser humano como ser consciente el que lleva a la existencia de nuestro universo
240196 tengo una fe enorme en la mente y en el esp ritu humanos y en el producto de su infinita creatividad creo contin a que la inteligencia humana est hecha a la imagen y semejanza de la divina y de la misma manera que la mente humana necesita de un cosmos donde residir sus aspectos f sicos el universo necesita de mente humana para su desarrollo pleno
240197 ianya perbuatan seolah olah berkata apa yang telah aku sampaikan kepadamu adalah hal hal yang wajib dilakukan oleh orang yang beriman kerana taat kepada perintah allah swt supaya menerima perdamaian
240198 tidak berlaku dalam suatu kejayaan yang lebih besar daripada kejayaan perjanjian hudaibiyah sekalipun jika dibanding dengan kejayaan perang badar perang uhud perang khandaq dan lain lain lagi sesungguhnya manusia berperang selama ini ketika mereka bertembung apabila perdamaian telah berjaya diusahakan oleh rasulullah saw api peperangan telah terpadam mereka hidup dalam aman damai saling bertemu dan berbincang muqabalah dan muzakarah antara satu sama lain islam makin diterima oleh penentangnya kerana sememangnya islam itu agama yang paling sesuai untuk mengatur kehidupan manusia dalam masa beberapa tahun selepas perjanjian damai semakin ramai orang menganut atau menerima islam berbanding semasa orang islam dan orang kafir berperang
240199 sesungguhnya allah akan menguji kamu dengan suatu sungai maka siapa di antara kamu meminum airnya bukanlah ia pengikutku dan barangsiapa tiada meminumnya kecuali menceduk seceduk tangan maka dia adalah pengikutku

240203 theres something out there but its not the traditional god
240204 ive definitely been working out getting back to my college roots
240205 doing a lot of plyometrics a lot of conditioning and a lot of stickwork
240206 it made you dig deeper as a person its one of the goals youve aspired to to be on a world cup team and its one of your only goals playing lacrosse that you havent reached
240207 it took me a month or two to regroup no one wants to get cut it definitely hit a low point but it made me that much stronger it was a gift and a curse
240208 im almost positive she will be a u s player if not this year then in the future
240209 shed always reach out to younger players and give verbal support
240210 but when it was her time in the cage it was her
240211 having wills on the other side totally ups my game when shes out there i try to play at that level
240212 i feel like im low on the totem pole were starting from scratch but thats ok
240213 its funny to be back here at umbc because this is where our u 19 team tryouts were you just kind of recall every detail
240214 playing with the u 19 team its pretty much at that college level
240215 but this is obviously a good warm up for the college level too
240216 we know that fios will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force
240217 having said that it would be unfortunate if a strike comes but well deal with it if and when it comes

240314 most of our suppliers have worked with us for many years and understand this aspect of the fmcg industry
240315 suppliers are carefully selected for their ability to deliver consistently against demand fluctuations and contain cost during this process
240316 the supply chains are reliant on the supplier delivering quality products on time and in the right quantities for manufacture
240317 pz cussons manufacturing sites have limited storage capacity and products must arrive as and when requested in order to manage the flow of materials and goods
240318 suppliers who collaborate closely are invited to participate in innovation workshops that are focused on new product development this is an opportunity to have some fun be creative but more importantly to add significant value to pz cussons product portfolio
240319 all key suppliers work off annual technical and commercial business plans these plans detail collaborative projects bringing together the suppliers and pz cussons expertise to develop new products results of this collaboration benefit the customer consumer pz cussons and the supplier who benefits commercially through new material sales
240320 suppliers are in the business of making profit as is any business a supplier that is commercially unstable is a risk to continuity of supply the supplier will cut costs irresponsibly to survive with resulting service level drops and quality issues therefore there must be a balance between sustainable and acceptable cost the supplier must be able to consistently deliver at the quoted price and make a profit the pz cussons purchasing team ensures that prices are constantly benchmarked globally and are acceptable we work closely with our suppliers sharing benchmark data and offering them every opportunity to remain competitive in a global environment margin improvement is critical to the supply chain delivering the right cost levels working together with our suppliers on cost improvements ensures there is no threat to the future of both pz cussons and the suppliers business
240321 we find this process is effective in keeping quality and service levels high
240322 as we improve internally we find the need to raise the bar with our suppliers and we use the same process to implement these changes
240323 suppliers are crucial to success in a fast dynamic and complex supply chain when selected and managed well they are a phenomenal asset if neglected they can be our greatest liability at pz cussons we manage our suppliers with trust and respect for their commitment to our business we find that this is rewarded through affiliations that are more flexible and in step with our business requirements

240426 but braylon usually doesnt make too many mistakes just as long as he continues working hard hes going to be one of the great players for a long time
240427 now i just have to put the icing on it
240428 the united states government should not be in the business of stealing from the rich man in order to give to the poor rather its purpose is to guarantee that all have the same equal opportunity to gain access to the same wealth
240429 a sees something wrong with x b observes the same problem both a and b connive and collude to get c to pay for fixing xs problem c is the forgotten man in this equation
240430 the united states government should not be in the business of stealing from the rich man in order to give to the poor rather its purpose is to guarantee that all have the same equal opportunity to gain access to the same wealth
240431 our biggest concern is that the inquests will now be postponed and also the isc report
240432 it is much worse for the bereaved because they need to have an inquest they need to know and its still hanging over them and because it is still hanging over them it is still hanging over us the survivors because we are all in this together

240437 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
240438 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
240439 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
240440 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
240441 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
240442 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
240443 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
240444 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
240445 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
240446 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party

240448 we stand ready to work with the new congress and whoever is elected president
240449 far exceeds what outsiders have reported as the estimated download total from the bands official website regardless of whether those downloaders paid or not
240450 you dont really believe in the concept of personal space do you
240451 simply makes clear that when an employer states that its pay scale is informed by a factor other than sex that must actually be true and not just an excuse to continue discriminatory practices
240452 common sense changes to strengthen the equal pay act so that it will be a more effective tool in combating gender based pay discrimination
240453 womens work should be valued equally passing this bill today is an important step toward making that happen
240454 it was pretty much the same with the last record
240455 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
240456 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
240457 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
240458 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
240459 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
240460 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
240461 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
240462 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
240463 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
240464 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
240465 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
240466 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens

240468 en general los mercados son un instrumento esencial de la gesti n p blica del agua y est n aqu para quedarse no vamos a poder vivir sin ellos esto es algo que estaba claro incluso entre los m s cr ticos

240473 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
240474 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
240475 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
240476 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
240477 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
240478 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
240479 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
240480 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
240481 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
240482 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
240483 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
240484 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be

240557 threat of a recession means outsourcing providers may see a period of intense activity as companies race to sign similar deals
240558 both companies have learnt much about the challenges risks and benefits of the proposed outsourcing more significantly deutsche post it services continued to improve its cost position increased the number of services delivered while also maintaining service levels simply put during the six months of the evaluation our improving cost position made hps job that much harder and their cost reduction target that much more difficult to achieve
240559 not a reflection of hps merits as a service provider it is a vote of confidence in deutsche post it services and our track record of service delivery
240560 the deutsche post and hp teams working on the project identified a number of areas where optimization can be achieved without outsourcing at this time

240592 this is stunning you have a rare ability to find sensitive moments in some very insensitive situations what a talent
240593 incredible not just because they are excellent photographs but because they are frighteningly honest i hope you continue to make these strong thought provoking records and that you stay safe in what must be incredibly difficult situations both physically and emotionally
240594 it would be somewhat of an understatement to say i was impressed with your work we obviously know how dangerous it is to be involved in that theater iraq im sure that every moment of every day is just on the verge of chaotic for what is that war war if not the ultimate of chaos and yet you have these moments where you pause to compose image of graphic quality equal to content admire all you compositional skills but am especially taken by the wideangle work do your best to do so and know youre held in high esteem
240595 i have to confess that i couldnt sleep properly after seeing your photos the first time these images are still in my mind and wont let me go
240596 there is a great passion in every single shot and im very impressed sad shocked touched deeply moved frightened and inspired in the same way you are documenting a very important episode of history your pictures speak for themselves and your work is beyond words your work is not easy as it is difficult to photograph people in distress however it concerns us all and we shall not forget
240597 into the very depths of my soul i cannot begin to even sum up with words the depths of how your images reach out to me it brings me down to earth and reminds me as to why i picked up the camera in the first place your works are truly inspiring youre very privileged to have to see these places with your own eyes observe and capture through your lens the true state of the world we live in as for now for me itll have to be through your eyes your pictures and the stories they tell truly honored
240598 there is a hunger to know the truth about war and your accurate presentation of it is exemplary i dont believe it possible to be unmoved by your images this is especially true for those of us who live in a very different world essentially free from the suffering and carnage you portray thank you for your dedication and courage you are making and incredible contribution to world understanding hopefully not at an extreme cost to yourself war photography seems like a hard way to make a living on many levels living and breathing civilian trauma is not easy but it is more localized you can get away from it by driving or moving to another location but with war there is no escape the reality is so harsh and overwhelmingly pervasive into all areas of life stay safe many will be following you
240599 thanks zoriah for your hard work and incredible vision and for the inspiration your example lends to others who have put down the gun or never carried one

240626 deserves to take a well earned place in history in the company of phillip jones griffith don mc cullen larry burrows and robert capa the minimal presentation of his work is perfect the viewer fills in the details and the images linger stubbornly in the memory to awake one from sleep in a cold sweat these images cannot be taken in in one viewing the viewer returns restlessly again and again attempting to process the information this is really happening iconic compelling images of war by a true professional i take my hat off to him
240627 a chilling commentary on the madness of war all war
240628 the worlds cruelty compressed into some thousand pixels its so impressive
240629 right up there with robert capa wonderful work you should be with magnum you are showing all sides of the conflict
240630 what you are doing is so so important i cannot even contemplate what horror and pain you have seen but see it we must true dedication and bravery is the only way to expose such inhumanity keep truth as your motto and maybe this silly world we live in will someday wake up and treat people as living souls not simply pieces of meat to be traded in worthless pointless conflicts i salute you sir
240631 his commitment to photojournalism can not be denied i am certain he will secure a place amongst some of our best
240632 i am awed by these images some rank among the best millitary images ive ever seen and ive collected all the greats
240633 i am in awe i really dont know what to say i havent been this affected since i saw nachtweys work
240634 it is a eye opener to view your work it brings strong emotions when doing so your work reflects another side of the world around us and beyond i will use it to find inspiration for myself thanks for sharing these pictures with us
240635 amazing difficult to stomach i am very emotional but just brilliant and captivating thanks for sharing all your photos

240646 late night poolside parties and ginos east chicago style deep dish pizza
240647 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
240648 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
240649 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
240650 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
240651 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
240652 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
240653 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
240654 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
240655 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
240656 we know that fios will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force

240660 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable

240662 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
240663 there is some room for optimism on the corporate profit front
240664 but a lot will depend on consumers and energy prices for the remainder of the year
240665 10 years ago pretty much exactly we had the number one song on kroq and sold out the troubadour the roxy and the viper room during the summer
240666 next week well play in front of 60 people at las largo and were happy
240667 this is serious violation because of the contamination we just dont want people eating and buying this food would you want your kids to buy the food if theyre walking by the park i wouldnt want to buy it i get sick sometimes when i go to a regular restaurant
240668 the 0 release was very limited and were now getting over that the range of platforms has expanded again where kde 4 0 was basically a linux only desktop for 4 1 were realizing the cross platform benefits that we had in mind for kde4 so it runs on free software operating systems like freebsd and opensolaris and also on proprietary systems like mac os x and microsoft windows thats one of the reasons that it was important to get kde 4 0 out relatively early to mark a line in the sand and kick off the porting efforts for kde4 i know both the freebsd and opensolaris kde communities had 4 1 in mind as a good target to make available on those platforms
240669 kde 4 1 is a significant release for the project because 4 0 was controversial for some its architectural breaks and some quality issues
240670 in that respect this is the service pack 1 equivalent to a windows release while i havent installed it on my kubuntu instance yet 4 1 is generally getting positive reviews and seeing the kinds of reactions youd expect from a follow on update
240671 seeing the reactions to kde 4 0 has hammered home an important message to us as a whole i think its not 2003 anymore and the number of users willing to use linux and try new software has grown enormously
240672 the demographics of our users are different now the message of stick with kde3 until kde4 matures enough for you didnt get through loud enough kde 4 1 sends the message kde4 is mature enough for early adopter desktop users and i think well be putting on the remaining polish to get it to casual users within the kde 4 1 lifespan of about six months
240673 something else that stands out to me and forgive me if it seems trivial but the hovering icons in the startup screen have now had their reflections adjusted to appear all in the same mirror earlier versions had reflections floating around in strange places
240674 a tiny graphical change like that stands out because in general kde4 is so pretty to look at and so consistent i know theres plenty of grumbling about the looks all i can say is that i like them that a small mistake stands out like that id like to congratulate the artists on their attention to detail even in the face of tremendous work pressure
240675 as for shuttleworths comments im in full agreement in a piece i wrote a few years back i echoed marks belief that pretty is a feature obviously there must be substance behind the eye candy but apples ability to wow via its pretty ui is certainly instructive
240676 whats less clear is how those looks are achieved and with what technologies many hold up qt the framework upon which kde is built as the answer because its easier to design good looking applications with it than with gtk its gnome counterpart but gnome is more popular with enterprises and has a lead in adoption there plus there are licensing issues so its a difficult question to answer
240677 for me on a free software operating system kde succeeds when it doesnt matter what os is underneath it just works regardless and were pretty darn close there

240702 honestly maam it cost nothing you see a deceased gentleman of about your husbands size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday and he was wearing an attractive blue suit i asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice

240748 i found myself being asked hey are you on facebook or add me as a friend on facebook and when i found out how to join i started adding people immediately and joining groups
240749 great way to meet new students at school and stay connected with old high school friends
240750 i just recently joined and its a great way to network with people who do the same thing you do they put up drum corps pictures and talk about their shows you get to enjoy it from their perspective and see it through their eyes
240751 i get to meet up with drum corps people ive never met before they see that im involved with corps and we get to talk about it
240752 its proven to be a great success for fundraising corps dues invitations can be sent to school corps work and friends for donations i have gotten from 10 up to 80 from supporters its very helpful
240753 even if you dont need money you can create invites for mail and care packages its always fun to get mail on the road or post your corps tour calendar which invites people to go see you
240754 the drum corps activity is very special to me regardless that i have never marched with a corps it has helped increase my love of music and opened up my eyes to a vast array of teaching methods drum corps unites people from different backgrounds i can only hope to spread my love of drum corps to others
240755 for many of us its almost more common to check facebook than it is to check our e mail
240756 its another advertising outlet so to speak to get the word out there about drum corps the dci facebook group not only allows current fans to have accessibility to features and links in one place but it allows new fans a chance to become familiar with the spectacle of drum corps and its fan base
240757 i am actually quite impressed with the groups success which is due in large part to the actual members of the group who spread the word and invite their friends
240758 ive noticed an appreciation among the members of the group when a question is posed and answered some members of the group may go on to march in a corps or are given a newfound hope because of conversations they have with corps members and alumni in the group members of the group who have marched have been really helpful and encouraging and i feel thats a very important part of the future of drum corps encouraging the younger generations to live out their dreams of marching
240759 by some miracle be on staff with a drum corps
240760 i know that no matter where life takes me ill always follow drum corps because it never ceases to amaze me i made a promise to myself a few years back that i will attend the world championships every year until i am physically unable i am very honored and humbled that dci took notice in what began as a simple gesture of admiration

240763 it wasnt as difficult as i thought it was going to be but it definitely wasnt easy
240764 everything about writing comics especially when youre writing for a company like idw marvel what have you everything has to fit into their particular page count so trying to pick and choose out of an entire screenplay which scenes should get the priority and how deeply you go into each scene can be difficult its a matter of picking and choosing
240765 i had to add a couple of scenes here and there to round it out and make the characters pop a little more to give an overall sense of what was happening in that world
240766 that was important and i think it worked out pretty well
240767 usually when you do something that has potential for a franchise you can only give them a quarter of the potential of the universe at a time thats what we did plus with films theyre woefully expensive depending on how all of them do you might not to get to expand them the way you conceived with comic books however you have a chance to go into the nooks and crannies of the universe
240768 i like keeping it a cold war status even though i will tell you as a rule i dont like vampires and never have

240975 it is our view that u s policy makers have aggressively and successfully addressed the problems of systemic risk in the u s economy however we expect more bad news during the next six to 9 months from the economy as job cuts continue and from real estate markets as occupancy rents and prices fall that said we feel the headlines do not accurately reflect u s or global real estate fundamentals no one can predict when the trepidation will ease but companies and investors who prepare for more bad news with a strategy in mind in the short run and a plan for recovery in the long term will emerge stronger in the end

240979 if the shareholders of the new york times ever wonder why the papers ad revenue is plummeting and its share price tanking they need look no further than the hysterical reaction of the papers editors to any slight real or imagined against their preferred candidate
240980 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
240981 well we know the republicans ran a racist ad against harold ford in the tennesse senate race

240998 these people are going through a very vulnerable time in their lives they need their support system we certainly want these patients to be dealt with on home territory thats certainly the most important thing for them
240999 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
241000 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
241001 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved
241002 the cuban athletes were badly taken care of that city has the privilege of hosting that championship every year we should analyze whether it is worth attending that tournament

241022 es ist eine ironie des schicksals die ganze zeit hatte ich jetzt fast keine probleme mehr mit verkehr und dann ausgerechnet hier derart massiv es ist wirklich frustrierend es war unglaublich mit dem zweiten satz reifen habe ich keine einzige runde mehr zusammengebracht zweimal war jemand im letzten sektor massiv im weg einmal die gelben flaggen wegen karuns dreher das auto war gut genug f r die top drei das sieht man auch an den sektorzeiten aber was n tzt es und hier ist halt neben monaco der schlechteste platz f r so was

241058 isnt that the case now i mean do you really think that if u s forces had osama bin laden in their sights and the pakistanis said no that they wouldnt fire or wouldnt go after him
241059 you do have a situation seven years on into this war where osama bin laden and all his lieutenants and all the leaders of the taliban theyre still there theyre inside pakistan

241081 if the left today really wants to get serious about being a force for change instead of a calcified form of political scientology its going to have to outgrow its reflexive nostalgia for murderous absolutism its superheroic fantasies of revolution by artistic proxy its smug propensity for not only making but valorizing the same mistakes and do a better job of imagining a pluralistic non dogmatic society that ordinary people might conceivably want to join one good place to start looking could be alain tanners 1976 film jonah who will be 25 in the year 2000

241133 taxpayer dollars are limited for publicly funded programs we try to come up with polices that provide the most good for the most people

241155 this is to advise you that on this date pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 11 and 12 of article vi of the oklahoma constitution to approve or object to legislation presented to me i have vetoed house bill 2633 under current state and federal law oklahoma public school students are already allowed to express their faith through voluntary prayer and other activities while well intended this legislation is vaguely written and may trigger a number of unintended consequences that actually impede rather than enhance such expression for example under this legislation schools could be forced to provide equal time to fringe organizations that masquerade as religions and advocate behaviors such as drug use or hate speech that are dangerous or offensive to students and the general public additionally the bill would presumably require school officials to determine what constitutes legitimate religious expression subjecting them to an explosion of costly and protracted litigation that would have to be defended at taxpayers expense

241166 a window is not beautiful in itself and staring at one without looking through it misses the point likewise faith in and of itself is never the end goal faith like prayer should be a way of connecting with god i have talked with many spiritually seeking people who are struggling to find satisfaction because they are using the window of faith more like a mirror they have caught sight of their own reflection in the window glass and have forgotten to adjust their depth of focus to look beyond to see the beauty that surrounds them the beauty that is god

241169 artistry easily becomes idolatry and when this happens art is seen to exist only for its own sake and not for any higher purpose it is said that when henri matisse completed his masterly paintings in the chapel of the rosary at venice he stepped back and proclaimed i did it for myself
241170 we are living in a fallen and broken world yet for all its ugliness this world was made by god and will be saved by his grace therefore we should devote our skill to making art for the glory of god and for the sake of his son our beautiful savior jesus christ
241171 art is an incarnation of the truth it penetrates the surface of things to portray them as they really are
241172 some christians continue to think that certain forms of art are more godly than others they make a sharp distinction between the sacred and the secular not recognizing that so called secular art is an exploration of the world that god has made and therefore has its place in deepening our understanding of gods person and work christians usually prize symbolic art especially if its symbolism is religious representational art is also valued because it imitates the world that god has made what christians tend to dismiss is abstract art especially as it has come to expression in modern art yet abstraction has gods blessing as much as any other art form the example of the tabernacle proves that god loves all kinds of art in all kinds of media and all kinds of styles provided that is that they are in keeping with the perfections of his character as christians we are not limited to crosses and flannel graphs or to praise choruses and evangelistic skits these simple forms may have their place in the life of the church but god wants all of the arts to flourish in all the fullness of their artistic potential so that we may discover the inherent possibilities of creation and thereby come to a deeper knowledge of our creator

241176 one of the finest examples of a far right wing rag as i have ever seen
241177 just take a look at the editorial page before they actually printed letters to the editor even ones that were hostile to the status quo in rockwall but now that it is time to get on the bandwagon to get ralph hall re elected they cant have any rational debate on important issues or disagreement with his umbilical attachment to anything king george wanted to do
241178 and you wont read about jodie laubenberg and bob deuells subservience to tom craddicks agenda
241179 debate or commentary on such vital issues to rockwall citizens has been replaced by commentaries from three right wing nuts
241180 keep leafing through and you come to page 6 where the top article is a column in large letters entitled

241409 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
241410 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
241411 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
241412 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
241413 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
241414 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
241415 minorities on boards can accomplish a great deal i look forward to working harmoniously with the new board of yahoo
241416 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
241417 this citation was used to help frame the response and illustrate why we believe this suit is without merit it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy to be clear google respects an individuals right to privacy
241418 the principle focus of this investigation was subprime mortgage fraud
241419 but it was impossible not to recoil at the extremely worrisome statistics in the subprime lending market in general we are seeing foreclosures among new yorks subprime mortgage holders at alarming rates a situation made far worse by unscrupulous appraisers and brokers
241420 exhibited every characteristic and feature associated with dangerous subprime loans
241421 im like in a million dollar debt in housing and cash poor
241422 a lot of one stop shops where real estate agents are also mortgage brokers operate in minority neighborhoods
241423 customers in minority communities eligible for prime loans have been pushed into taking out high risk subprime loans by shady mortgage brokers
241424 the potential for conflict of interest and outright criminality is so great when one individual acts as both real estate broker agent and mortgage broker in a single transaction it should be prohibited
241425 but when people go to buy a home they should have a trusted attorney and they should never take a recommendation from a real estate agent
241426 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
241427 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
241428 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
241429 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
241430 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
241431 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
241432 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
241433 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
241434 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person
241435 sometimes ill run down the street and jump into the cab with the chinese person and say ok lets go together the chinese person will usually get out of the cab
241436 business is good you just have to learn how they do things
241437 for instance americans are warm and outgoing japanese are hardworking but stingy germans are inflexible but punctual
241438 the stereotypes were formed historically but may change with passing time
241439 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business
241440 ive learned a few simple phrases of english for the products in my store like green tea beer and coke
241441 i went quite far im sorry i didnt go farther but you know what can you do america has spoken no canadians were allowed to vote
241442 i wish canadians wouldve been able to vote because i have a lot of support here it couldve helped me out quite a bit but you know thats the rule
241443 voting is open to all persons located in the 50 united states the district of columbia and puerto rico
241444 in the end its been a really great thing and ive met a lot of amazing people
241445 i think its brought my comedy to a lot more people and hopefully ill be able to capitalize on that in america
241446 thats only in canada that people would kind of question if its fair that im involved
241447 its the only place anybody ever asked me why are you doing this arent you already doing well and im like well doing well in canada as a performer monetarily its not enormously lucrative and its a small market
241448 la curaci n de los huesos es ahora el punto cr tico
241449 salaries were pathetic smart people would avoid it it was disorganized thats all gone weve been catching up and once you go from non competitive to competitive organizations have to join in the party or theyll be eaten alive
241450 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
241451 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
241452 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
241453 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
241454 in analyzing whether comcast violated federal policy when it blocked access to certain applications we conduct a fact specific inquiry into whether the management practice they used was reasonable
241455 based on many reasons including the arbitrary nature of the blocking the lack of relation to times of congestion or size of files and the manner in which they hid their conduct from their subscribers we conclude it was not
241456 gratified that the commission did not find any conduct by comcast that justified a fine
241457 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to websites or online applications including peer to peer services
241458 considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
241459 such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service

241478 in the 1600s bulldogs were used for bullbaiting as well as bearbaiting a gambling sport popular in the 17th century with wagers laid in which trained bulldogs leapt at a bull lashed to a post latched onto its snout and attempted to suffocate it 3 bulldogs have many distinct characteristics that were bred into them so they would be better suited to bullbaiting the bulldogs body is short low to the ground and compact allowing it to be able to scuttle or crawl low under the bulls horns the lower jaw sticks out further than the top one allowing the bulldog to grip on the nose of the animal and still be able to breathe due to the lay back of the nose the wrinkles on the bulldogs face allow the blood from the other animal to run down the bulldogs face instead of going into its eyes

241505 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
241506 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay

241517 its about the old west and making bad guys pay

241528 dear drs please forgive me for this horrible transgression i have no where else to turn so i ask you to mercifully gently and lovingly please help him sleep his name is kaiser and hes 16 and a half years old hes been my friend my teacher my pupil my lifelong loving and loyal companion
241529 be good to him as you would your own child for hes been mine for a loving lifetime
241530 i feel that the clothes do reflect the man wearing them with don hes a very strong masculine guy who doesnt give up a lot of information about himself so we keep him in somber serious tones he wears some brown but its usually gray which was the traditional business suit color its a delicate balance hes slightly always have his hat on when hes leaving but the cuts of his suits give him a modern look and he also wears a french cuff shirt with a spread collar which i love its classic but with the cufflinks and tie theres a little pizzazz which makes sense for someone in a creative field
241531 for all the slim sharkskin suits the guys wear there were still those at the time that were more traditional thats where cooper or roger sterling come in who are the old guards more traditional and buttoned up in pleated pants and three piece suits but theyre impeccably tailored and finished
241532 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out
241533 and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should nobody is going protect the natural world unless they understand it

241553 honey i would like venn pongal and sambar for tonights dinner luv xxx
241554 i am sorry but your requirements are unclear what kind of sambar do you need do you also need coconut chutney i know it is not mentioned but i have to ask to keep my customer delighted
241555 objective to have dinner tonight requirements req 1 venn pongal made using sona masoori rice with less usage of pepper corn and more ginger rice has to be slightly over cooked for better taste req 2 onion sambar with bits of carrot sambar can be made using mtr powder if home made powder is unavailable note use less tamarind paste as it will be too sour from me platform standard indian kitchen with standard crockery items contact list xxx 91 123456789 constraints internet recipe references strictly prohibited use mother in laws provided supplemental copy of cooking for dummies along with the encyclopedia of south indian cooking by grandma
241556 oh 400 includes the cost of father in law even though he is in your hometown and doesnt contribute anything phone support with mother in law and a new innovative idea for dinner making ipod yes it includes the cost of ipod and it is just one time cost i believe i can cook better if i listen to music while cooking it will improve quality standards
241557 hey can you also make coconut chutney please just thought i would like that too with pongal
241558 you will need to raise a change request and will have to pay an extra 20 for that and it may not get done until tomorrow morning is that ok with you
241559 can you please fill out the feedback form for customer satisfaction also please send this in an email so i can send it to my manager mother in law for an award and my performance review for the year
241560 oh but i had to add one comment sambar needs a little bit of salt
241561 i had followed your requirements word by word and it was assumed that we will use standard amount of salt for the dishes i will have to analyze the problem and then will look into it
241562 lets start by systematically analyzing the problem has n fainted
241563 no n is still wide awake munching down the pongal
241564 so this is definitely not a severity 1 high severity issue then is he atleast choking begging for life anything at all
241565 it is not even severity 2 medium severity then we have to categorize it as severity 3 low severity and you dont need to fix it until a week that is what the service level agreement says
241566 did you hear that i dont need to fix it until next week
241567 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it if we could create nato to face down the soviet union we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman in london and bali in washington and new york if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope
241568 if we we presumably meaning the u s and what was then western europe could win a battle of ideas against the communists we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope
241569 voting with george bush ninety percent of the time just isnt good for the people and issues ive fought for over a lifetime
241570 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure with barack obama for better gas mileage
241571 and when president bush tried to cut medicaid the oregon health plan i said no
241572 im supporting jeff merkley because hell vote to make health care affordable again for the middle class and protect a womans right to privacy
241573 its not personal its about whats best for our country and our country is in trouble because of some bad policies and bad decisions these last eight years the inescapable fact is that electing jeff merkley is the only way we can win a senate majority that gets things done for people again
241574 and may we never be able to because if we do we will have adopted the ways of western socialist societies and these are failing models
241575 smith predicted that an improving economy and more stable iraq would build appreciation for bush in a second term
241576 i strongly supported president bushs tax cuts because i believe they helped provide americans the additional tools and freedom they need to better fulfill their dreams recent trends suggest that equipping americans natural ingenuity with a favorable tax code has helped revive our economy and i am proud to continue my commitment to that end

241595 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
241596 we stand ready to work with the new congress and whoever is elected president
241597 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
241598 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
241599 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
241600 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
241601 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
241602 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come

241614 the way those youngsters fought was inspiring its the first time theyve really stood up and played a mans innings
241615 ive played long enough to realise there are some games you can boss from start to finish but this was a real trembler
241616 we were almost dead and gone after wed been bowled out for 139 in the first innings
241617 i thought it was great to see the way adam shantry graham gillespie and james harris bowled in the first innings especially shantry because hes always been an unknown man
241618 we havent seen him around since the start of the season hes come back in after a few injuries and bowled nicely and gave us a bit of a sniff keeping them to 60 runs lead
241619 judgement of length was imperative as was playing with a straight bat
241620 i thought rees and grant did that well and it was good to watch they combated beautifully and we finished it off
241621 it also goes to show that if you do the basics right in cricket such as playing straight occupying the crease and keeping your composure then you do have a better chance

241629 karadzic bewoog zich blijkbaar vrijelijk door belgrado en bracht enkele bezoeken aan oostenrijk dus er moet een kring van invloedrijke mensen om hem heen hebben gestaan die hem trouw bleven en hem beschermden
241630 de geheime dienst die hem uiteindelijk arresteerde is dezelfde die hem al die jaren beschermde ik verwacht binnenkort ook de arrestatie van ratko mladic de andere bosnisch servische oorlogsmisdadiger die door het joegoslavi tribunaal wordt gezocht
241631 in cyprus word ik als turk gezien en in turkije als cyprioot
241632 ik woon hier nu 33 jaar bijna mijn hele leven ik heb vier kinderen de oudsten zijn 16 en 17 jaar die hebben hier op school gezeten en vrienden gemaakt we hebben hier ons leven onze familie en we voelen ons cyprioot je kunt ons toch niet zomaar terugsturen
241633 turkije houdt noord cyprus bezet en moet zijn biezen pakken
241634 het treurige is dat we in cyprus nu drie bevolkingsgroepen hebben griekse en turkse cyprioten en sinds 1974 dus ook turken
241635 het vn plan had belangrijke tekortkomingen het gaf geen absolute basis voor hereniging de turkse troepen mochten in cyprus blijven en de rechten voor vluchtelingen werden niet goed geregeld
241636 we hebben de deur op slot gedraaid en ons huis gekust die kus is het enige wat we hebben meegenomen
241637 natuurlijk wil ik terug alle griekse cyprioten willen terug naar hun landgoed en huizen maar ik heb me laten vertellen dat mijn huis er niet meer staat platgewalst door een turkse bulldozer net als veel griekse huizen en kerken in het noorden
241638 mijn idee van verzoening is dat we echt samengaan en n eiland worden niet in twee aparte zones als buren daarmee houd je in feite de verdeling in stand
241639 de gesprekken geven nieuwe hoop maar het is goed dat er met voorzichtigheid wordt gehandeld want als de verzoening nu weer stukloopt is het voor eens en altijd
241640 ik ben bang dat wij als grieken net als in 2004 toch meer zullen moeten toegeven dan ons lief is
241641 turkije is een grootmacht en wil in cyprus invloed blijven uitoefenen daarom ben ik blij dat turkije kandidaat is voor eu lidmaatschap dat betekent dat ze hun politiek zullen moeten aanpassen aan de europese maatstaven en bijvoorbeeld cyprus moeten erkennen
241642 de meeste cyprioten zijn wel voor verzoening maar voelen zich nog altijd primair turk of griek we zouden hier wat zelfbewuster moeten zijn en ons wat meer cyprioot moeten gaan voelen dat zou een oplossing een stuk dichterbij brengen
241643 het laat zien dat de verhoudingen hier fragiel zijn maar aan beide kanten wordt er gehandeld in een geest van optimisme de opening in de ledrastraat is een hoopvol teken dat voor euforie bij de bevolking zorgde ondernemers gingen hun terrassen inrichten mensen maakten plannen om hun oude vrienden aan de andere kant weer eens op te zoeken

241701 ever thought it was difficult to write software for linux for multiple distros internetnews reports that the lsb is making a push for their next release due out later this year that should help

241708 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that you spoke of it wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena a phenomena that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and right here in st petersburg by the st petersburg police and jena 6 and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country

241742 and then i heard the father talk everybody knows its important to speak english except these knuckleheads you cant be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth
241743 for me there is a time when we have to turn the mirror around
241744 because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us and it keeps a person frozen in their seat it keeps you frozen in your hole youre sitting in
241745 when you put on a record and that record is yelling n this and n that and youve got your little 6 year old 7 year old sitting in the back seat of the car those children hear that
241746 youve got to stop beating up your women because you cant find a job because you didnt want to get an education and now youre earning minimum wage

241773 the battle for wine and love or how i saved the world from parkerization
241774 increasingly i find i have a very particular peculiar palate and point of view i often dont taste or see the world in the same way others do
241775 i have a distinct preference for the traditional wines of western europe and a matching skepticism about most of the wines produced in the new world as well as for those wines make in the old world that seek to imitate the characteristics of their new world brethren
241776 but begin to deflate as soon as they are opened like blow up dolls
241777 you couldnt very well serve the most classic dishes from italy with these new wines
241778 as the journalists were slapping high scores on the new wines i retreated to my older collection every time i drank an old barolo i was overwhelmed with remorse there was the italian in me why change such a perfect thing what could i do to make sure these guys who followed the old way these holdouts didnt disappear altogether
241779 there were bad wines and great wines not right wines and wrong wines what you liked was in large part a question of taste a complex concept generally agreed upon to be a reflection of personal preference and part of tasting and understanding wine involved being open to the idea that some wine requires patience and work and is not instantly gratifying

241888 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
241889 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
241890 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
241891 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
241892 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign

241903 the way those youngsters fought was inspiring its the first time theyve really stood up and played a mans innings

241905 we were almost dead and gone after wed been bowled out for 139 in the first innings
241906 i thought it was great to see the way adam shantry graham gillespie and james harris bowled in the first innings especially shantry because hes always been an unknown man
241907 we havent seen him around since the start of the season hes come back in after a few injuries and bowled nicely and gave us a bit of a sniff keeping them to 60 runs lead
241908 judgement of length was imperative as was playing with a straight bat
241909 i thought rees and grant did that well and it was good to watch they combated beautifully and we finished it off

241941 in the end its been a really great thing and ive met a lot of amazing people
241942 i think its brought my comedy to a lot more people and hopefully ill be able to capitalize on that in america
241943 thats only in canada that people would kind of question if its fair that im involved
241944 its the only place anybody ever asked me why are you doing this arent you already doing well and im like well doing well in canada as a performer monetarily its not enormously lucrative and its a small market

241951 i feel very strongly that practical fx is used as much as possible its the only way to go with horror the home is going to be a very dark and scary film no camp here the home will be a character driven atmospheric twisted creature flick that im excited to have weta involved with their history of passion and innovation in this genre is well known and were thrilled to be working with them on bringing the heavy element of practical horrors that this movie calls for to life
241952 our team at weta workshop like the idea of mentoring young filmmakers the project is exciting to us its the type of film we really like its the type of films we used to make when we were younger the gang down here are very enthusiastic about being involved in another wonderful little horror movie

241955 however it can be just as dangerous if not more so
241956 foul language rowdy and disorderly behavior and to examples of the consumption of alcohol under circumstances that are detrimental

241965 meningkatkan pendidikan nasional dalam rangka mencerdaskan kehidupan bangsa dan meningkatkan taraf hidup rakyat untuk mencapai masyarakat adil dan makmur

241970 rakyat kita sekarang lapar rakyat yang lapar mana bisa diajak berfikir justru sangat mudah terprovokasi sehingga timbul kerusuhan dan konflik
241971 kalau kita peduli dengan rakyat dengan sendirinya rakyat akan peduli dengan kita
241972 kita harus mendobrak bahkan harus berani merombak sistem yang sudah sekarang ini berjalan yang menurut saya sangat jauh memperhatikan nasib nasib rakyat miskin yang kian hari kian bertambah
241973 yang terpenting adalah kita kembali kepada ideologi pancasila yang sekarang makin hari makin jauh kita tinggalkan kita tidak bisa terus terusan seperti ini
241974 specifically the commission found that comcast had deployed equipment throughout its network to monitor the content of its customers internet connections and selectively block specific types of connections known as peer to peer connections
241975 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped
241976 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them unfortunately that is exactly what comcast with their subscribers internet traffic
241977 comcast has an anticompetitive motive to interfere with customers use of peer to peer applications
241978 such applications including those relying on bittorrent provide internet users with the opportunity to view high quality
241979 these discriminatory management practices by the end of the year
241980 significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions

241982 oh god heat end so i may wear my lovley fur lined hoodies again
241983 for me i think its about who creates these roles
241984 ive only been successful when it came to roles that were specifically designed for being black
241985 they were looking for the stereotypical version of what ivy league was 50 years ago
241986 they sort of go around it in coded language in order to say that
241987 maybe just seeing those pictures up there maybe they wont react so strongly to it
241988 frequently black women are still portrayed as loud bossy or fat
241989 the pine sol lady in commercials is a throwback to this mammy stereotype
241990 why are black women portrayed on tv the movies in magazines and online as loud angry and desperate for love
241991 kids are growing up today thinking you have to be hip hop
241992 youve got regular 16 year olds theyre taking it too far with what you see on television
241993 you think oh look theres another stereotype of a black going through problems
241994 if i can interpret it if youve got a small company in israel who doesnt have a pervasive workforce around the world maybe theyve got two major markets for their product so they rely on the technology because they dont have as many people on the ground
241995 you cant be lazy with these systems the worst sin in intelligence is that someone hands you an analysis and you dont explore the cause of that analysis
241996 its not as if the technology is going to change a companys direction but it will help shape how they view the world
241997 when these packages work well theyre very good at filtering the noise out of the marketplace for management
241998 ten years ago they were pretty much desk jockey packages you bought a seat or three seats and the competitive intelligence group managed their database more of the packages today are being sold to broader sections of the company

242013 if you havent seen the movie i wont spoil it but lets just say that our hero does make a valiant effort to do the right thing sure we dont have to contend with giant man eating plants chasing around blind people but we do occasionally come across people that need assistance so when the opportunity comes up in our lives whether its mundane or heroic i hope we can be strong enough not to look the other way but to take a risk get involved and help someone out who needs it
242014 i wasnt trying to sell it i was trying to be valuable to the audience and to stay stable

242021 finding work that matters in the second half of your life
242022 erik erikson defines generativity as the realization that an essential responsibility of human life is to pass on what we have learned to future generations as he put it

242024 the first half of life is about compulsion the second half is about choice

242045 the way things are structured right now all of those costs to finance the boats are going to get passed through to the customers unless the government recognizes that infrastructure for the ferries is similar to infrastructure for the highways
242046 i think its getting to the point where bc ferries is shooting themselves in the foot
242047 prices are high enough that people arent using them and bc ferries are going to lose their revenues and then theyre going to start cutting trips which is just a downward spiral

242051 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
242052 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
242053 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
242054 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
242055 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
242056 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

242059 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
242060 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
242061 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
242062 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
242063 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
242064 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
242065 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
242066 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
242067 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
242068 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
242069 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
242070 terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
242071 by having an abortion her existing relationship and her existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated
242072 unprecedented interference in the doctor patient relationship and unprecedented interference in a womans life
242073 terminating the life of a whole separate unique living human being
242074 we have reached agreement regarding gazprom financing and building the new main gas pipelines from the east of the country developing gas fields and boosting the capacity of the turkmen sector of the caspian gas pipeline to 30 billion cubic meters
242075 both china and russia kept silent on the details of the consensus they reached on energy cooperation in the first round of their negotiation in beijing on the weekend
242076 it seems that a shift of russias energy export policy is under way russia might turn its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia ties are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade
242077 moscow finds the idea of coordination of gas production and pricing policy with other gas exporters to be too tempting to abandon
242078 this forum of gas exporters will set up the global gas balance it will give answers to the questions concerning when where and how much gas should be produced
242079 we have not only approved these agreements but have also decided to supervise their implementation
242080 i look forward to seeing all of you in venezuela
242081 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
242082 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
242083 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
242084 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
242085 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
242086 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
242087 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
242088 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
242089 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
242090 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
242091 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
242092 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
242093 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
242094 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
242095 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
242096 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
242097 the signing of the st regis dubai is another sign of starwoods commitment to develop all its brands in a fabulous destination like the middle east
242098 we are delighted to be working with eta star property developers on this new project and we hope this development is the beginning of a long term partnership
242099 we wanted this prestigious luxury brand to be part of our project and are proud to bring st regis to dubai
242100 we are sure dubai will benefit from the acclaimed luxury hospitality experience provided by st regis
242101 we have to make sure we are prepared for every option
242102 but we will not let the second holocaust take place
242103 all options are on the table if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
242104 they really need those external fund raising measures to get through to 2010
242105 the second quarter has been one of the fastest changing quarters ive ever seen
242106 theres no way that they had to tase me that many times
242107 it should be a couple months before im able to walk on my own
242108 i know im lucky to survive that far of a fall
242109 he was saying things like kill cops shoot cops ozark police capt thomas rousset said on july 23
242110 theres no way i could stand up i had a broken back and a broken foot
242111 i definitely want them to get punished i dont want them to get away with it
242112 if airports mix domestic and international passengers then we will consider requiring fingerprint checks to maintain security
242113 this room is vacant of most members of congress where oh where has congress gone
242114 this is a historic first conservatives will not go quietly home and neglect our duty to vote to bring down energy prices
242115 good to see youre putting in overtime for the 300 000 you received from the oil amp gas industry
242116 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
242117 as members of congress pull a stunt today on the floor of the house regarding oil drilling one day after exxon mobils record profits campaign money watch urges all voters and reporters to go to the nonpartisan center for responsive politics website opensecrets org and review how much each member of congress received from the oil and gas industry over their careers these contributions from big oil more than anything else will tell you what you need to know about todays circus
242118 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
242119 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
242120 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
242121 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
242122 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
242123 charter is pleased to offer its customers these four new hd channels
242124 charter is dedicated to providing the best value in hd programming and we know our customers will enjoy the outstanding programming offered by the addition of the hd channels
242125 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
242126 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
242127 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
242128 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
242129 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
242130 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
242131 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
242132 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
242133 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
242134 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
242135 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
242136 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
242137 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
242138 who are open to doing something on the production side
242139 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
242140 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
242141 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
242142 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
242143 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
242144 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
242145 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
242146 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
242147 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
242148 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
242149 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
242150 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
242151 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
242152 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
242153 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
242154 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
242155 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
242156 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
242157 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
242158 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
242159 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
242160 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
242161 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
242162 the brochures from printingforless com were very effective in my campaign advertising results
242163 there were five candidates running for the office of county commissioner and i received just over 50 percent of the votes i believe the brochure made a significant difference in the election
242164 we want to help you save time and money creating printing and mailing election campaign materials that reflect your specific message
242165 we have numerous campaign themed designs to choose from in three formats brochures postcards and door hangers all you have to do is select a format provide the copy and pictures and well do the rest
242166 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
242167 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
242168 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
242169 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
242170 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
242171 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
242172 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
242173 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
242174 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
242175 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
242176 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
242177 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
242178 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
242179 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
242180 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
242181 now that we have a candidate it has definitely helped in our efforts
242182 before you had a lot of people on the sidelines saying let me see who the nominee is and then well talk
242183 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
242184 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
242185 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
242186 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
242187 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign
242188 thats not to say that we have not received help from a lot of the people in the obama campaign
242189 were still a little bit short but im not worried about it
242190 the obama campaign is on the ground and theyre helping out and you know well have all the money that we need to pay everybody on time according to their contracts
242191 le monde entier est un pont tr s troit et lessentiel est de ne jamais avoir peur

242195 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
242196 also republicans can thank shadegg for turning on the microphones the first time
242197 we hope north korea will adopt a responsible attitude and come back to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation instead of taking any actions that may further escalate or worsen the situation

242209 over the years many local churches have been praying for god to bring revival here we believe that this event could be a very significant one in bringing about a christian awakening on a scale not seen in our land for years
242210 there was a building hunger in a core group of denominations in the greenock area to see a genuine biblical revival i was contacted and laid it out before the lord after weeks of prayer god began to confirm that we were to have a conference there this event is bigger than any speaker we are coming to meet with and petition god to see a spiritual awakening
242211 for some time now we have been meeting together on a regular basis to seek revival in inverclyde and beyond in addition over the years many local churches have been praying for god to bring revival here we believe that this event could be a very significant one in bringing about a christian awakening on a scale not seen in our land for years

242227 and if the russian court decides to apply civil rico to this case it would be absolutely correct in doing so
242228 to limit rico to the u s courts would undercut the remedial and liberal will of congress in enacting the statute

242294 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode

242448 chris is presently under nfl suspension and until such time as he may be reinstated we are not in position to comment

242462 its ridiculous thats not a suitable offer for someone who was a good player on a good team it wasnt a market value offer and thats the bottom line
242463 more than frustrated i guess id say im insulted by it i thought they valued what i bring as a player and a person but maybe i had an inflamed opinion of what they thought about me

242500 the ravens are going to have to open the checkbook
242501 he was such an incredible asset to me as a new coach to have somebody that could lead the team the way he did he basically led by example he worked hard he had a passion for the game unlike most he had this in his head that he wanted to play on and its very similar to what grant had he was always working towards getting to the next level solem remembered lipinski having a knack for the net but also exceptional vision on the ice that allowed him to set up his teammates for open shots after all it was lipinski who was faribaults all time assist leader before pavek eclipsed his mark this season
242502 the only defenseman in the huskies upcoming freshman class is maley an excellent skater from the des moines buccaneers of the u s hockey league he posted a goal and five assists in 31 games for the buccaneers in 2007 08 while playing hurt for most of the season he will add an offensive dimension for the huskies on the blueline is good on the power play and is a good shot blocker
242503 quailer has excellent breakaway type of speed and a good stride he has good hands and shoots the puck well he has good playmaking ability good vision and is able to play any one of the forward positions he utilizes a very quick release not generally winding up but is able to snap the puck from all areas of the ice quailer is very strong on the puck and is able to protect in the corners
242504 wohl second team all star set st marys team record for most power play goals in one season 21 in 2006 07
242505 he is a responsible two way forward with a good blend of speed and skill a gifted scorer and faceoff man he gives the huskies with the ability to play both center and wing
242506 he is a great skater a good two way forward and can play both center and wing he is a physical player with skill and toughness

242513 he played great at torrey pines in nearly winning the u s open and the guys just got too much talent to go without winning a major for the balance of his career
242514 and i consider myself a very good driver of the golf ball
242515 i think i need to putt more consistently over the whole week
242516 i havent really had a fantastic putting week over the four days when ive needed it so if i can do that this week then i feel pretty confident ill be there or thereabouts coming into the end of the week
242517 i think we should be talking about the tournament and not somebody thats not here this is the biggest as far as im concerned its the biggest tournament in the world its bigger than any one golfer really
242518 the will to win means nothing if you havent the will to prepare
242519 with the football team making it to the bowl game which was in mobile flying required solich was to receive some for bonuses furthermore the athletic department is scrambling to not only cover those costs but the costs of flying all of the football players redshirted freshman included who were not going to play in the game as a result they cut womens lacrosse their operating budget was much more significant than the track and swimming teams because they cut the lacrosse team in order to pay the bonuses of solich they were out of compliance with title ix which is why track and swimming are gone

242526 the punisher j j hickson disciplines knicks as cavs drop summer league opener
242527 heres one more for you and this is a fact j j hickson put up 26 points on 11 for 15 shooting and ripped nine boards as the cavs dropped a 97 94 summer league decision to the new york knicks on monday
242528 yeah against a bunch of guys that will be bagging groceries in a couple of months
242529 its easy for fans to look at this one game by hickson and say something to the effect of its just one summer league game
242530 that ability to bang around the paint will serve hickson well on a cavaliers squad that is looking to repeat as the best rebounding team in the league cleveland led the league with a 4 15 rebounding differential in addition to strengthening the teams front line hickson has the opportunity to learn under ben wallace who may have fallen off a bit in his production but can still teach hickson a thing or two about how to use that big body of his
242531 daniel has been an important part of our cavs family the last two seasons he has worked to grow as a player and we love his passion for winning and the game itself hes been great off the court as well and is exactly the kind of person were proud to have with us
242532 in re signing daniel it helps the cavs both build continuity and create a young core that will be in cleveland for many years to come
242533 dont call him anderson varejao boobie gibson cavs agree to five year deal

242552 at the department component level we found that the processes individual components used from 2002 through 2006 for proposing candidates to the screening committee appeared to be merit based
242553 based on our investigation we concluded that goodling violated federal law and department policy and committed misconduct by improperly considering political or ideological affiliations in screening candidates for certain career positions at the department

242569 as with most things excessive levels of antioxidants can be toxic

242608 im very happy at this club and everything is fine
242609 for me now the most important thing as i always say is to keep my head on my shoulders
242610 what am i going to achieve in the future with arsenal is the most important thing now
242611 if we can get a midfielder with experience that will do it
242612 i dont think the best tactic is to come out with names
242613 now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season

242631 i couldnt believe how clear my skin was this wash along with the night day creams have transformed my face i occasionally have a zit now and then and they are not nearly as bad as before it doesnt dry out my skin and as a bonus it doesnt bleach my clothes towels and bedding
242632 this scrub cant be beat the smell texture and smoothness is incomparable i love spreading this on my elbows feet and legs then rinsing and not needing any additional creams or lotions and believe me i have dry skin i even use it on my kids feet and knees ages 10 and 7 theyre always on the floor crawling around it works great the smell is also awesome fresh and clean gingery citrus the absolute best i only wish it came in a bigger size i use it so frequently it doesnt last in my house
242633 every time i use one which sadly cant be that often as they are a bit more expensive than id like them to be my face just looks incredible afterwards
242634 i was hesitant to start using a night cream because my skin is fairly oily this cream has been such an eye opener when i wake up in the morning my skin is glowing and super hydrated im so glad ive given this cream a chance the bright plus line is changing my skin rapidly my oil production has become more regulated my skin is not too oily or super tight and dehydrated its perfect and supple and above and beyond that it is so bright and even looking i am in love with this line
242635 i have tried many many facial cleansers and have been using this exclusively since i first tried it a couple of years ago i have combination skin that is prone to both dry patches and also blackheads clogged pores this is the only cleanser that i have found that does both a wonderful job of keeping my pores clean but also does not strip my face and leave it crepey or scaly looking it is by far the best that i have tried i am totally satisfied with it
242636 shiseido has always had great night creams as i call them but this is the best one theyve ever made
242637 i like to use natural soaps whenever possible but they usually smell very strong or soapy i bought the toms lavender scented bar and love it not too strong doesnt dry my skin suds up very nicely mvap47 9 99
242638 i have been using this product for years and i have sensitive skin which likes to still act like its going through puberty even though i am 40 i have combination skin and i have never had a problem with it causing breakouts i recommend it to anyone who needs a light moisturizer and has sensitive skin i am growing old gracefully as the good old saying goes

242640 aquaphor is one of those products you never want to be without it looks like petroleum jelly but i think its just a little thicker petroleum jelly is ok but to me it always seems to just sit on the surface of the skin aquaphor does more than that it sinks in and hydrates wherever you apply it i use it on heels cuticles lips and elbows but i also like to use it on my kids when they get dry patches that look like mild eczema often ill line my lips with a pencil and then use aquaphor on top as a lip balm the jar packaging is fine but i like the more controlled application of the tube i am never without it when i travel

242659 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
242660 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
242661 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
242662 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
242663 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
242664 wpp announces that the offer document containing the formal offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of tns is being posted today

242670 dividend superstar 1 10 1 yield from a rural phone company with steady revenues and a huge cash nest egg
242671 my favorite dividend paying company in this space is proof positive in the first quarter of 2008 it posted revenues of 105 million and profits of 49 million meanwhile this company is busily selling other money making services like high speed internet to its existing customers
242672 the stocks outsized dividend looks darn secure to me the company has more than 34 million in cash that could be used for payments to shareholders
242673 bottom line the stocks annual yield is currently 10 1 and as an extra bonus i think the shares stand to increase substantially in price
242674 if i can interpret it if youve got a small company in israel who doesnt have a pervasive workforce around the world maybe theyve got two major markets for their product so they rely on the technology because they dont have as many people on the ground
242675 you cant be lazy with these systems the worst sin in intelligence is that someone hands you an analysis and you dont explore the cause of that analysis
242676 its not as if the technology is going to change a companys direction but it will help shape how they view the world
242677 when these packages work well theyre very good at filtering the noise out of the marketplace for management
242678 ten years ago they were pretty much desk jockey packages you bought a seat or three seats and the competitive intelligence group managed their database more of the packages today are being sold to broader sections of the company

242686 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
242687 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
242688 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
242689 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

242742 he was playing too well for me and i was sluggish at the start
242743 he was too good was serving great and i wasnt moving well but i managed to turn it around with some big serving halfway through the second set
242744 i hit one really important forehand down the line for a winner when i was off balance and that almost changed the match a little bit
242745 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
242746 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality
242747 we dont need money to buy someone but its not just to buy it has to be the right person that is at the moment very difficult
242748 its not a problem because we have enough young players who can step in
242749 but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it
242750 i believe we were very unlucky last season as a squad we have made a big improvement last year we lost the premier league by four points
242751 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title
242752 we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
242753 when i was on holiday there was a lot of speculation people were talking on my behalf which is not me
242754 anyone can put what they want in the newspaper you can do it somebody else can do it i never told anyone that i would be leaving this club
242755 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
242756 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
242757 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
242758 i am very happy being at this club being part of this family
242759 now the most important thing is to keep my head on my shoulders what i did last season is behind me already
242760 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league
242761 it is true we are young but we know that if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something
242762 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
242763 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request it should be the other way round
242764 the rules are quite clear if you want a player you call the club and ask how much they want for him are you ready to sell him
242765 if its no you dont need to speak to the player because no is no

242772 im safe i didnt get hurt im acting im not mentally wounded im just happy to tell this story that hasnt been told yet
242773 they were afraid of the intensity of the story the intensity of emotion
242774 the whole year was kind of about re igniting a little enthusiasm with myself because i was grim
242775 its a beautiful story that hadnt made it to screen which is rare with a script which was so beautifully written and just hasnt been told before i looked at it as a wonderful opportunity
242776 the way we looked at it theyre not actually love scenes for the sake of doing love scenes theyre actually stories within each of those moments
242777 the first moment had to be this passionate adrenaline that just takes over him then theres another moment where it was really important to show a glimpse of his innocent and vulnerable state it is true intimate love that they have for each other
242778 i had to go in and discover what was causing his inability to express and to love i figured it was some sort of battle one of the conclusions was that he was battling himself battling his genetic structure he was battling his fathers traditions opinions and fears that have been passed down and have been deeply embedded into him
242779 once that kind of came to me i wanted it to be hard for him to express himself i wanted him to be a clenched fist
242780 hes always struggled with his sexuality hes the most masculine person i know
242781 i think the only time you really get to see potential or a slither of how del mar could express it is when hes with his children his children are the one area in his life in which he is safe and allowed to love the way he naturally feels he can with his wife his love is more manufactured and more traditional its not true love his love for jack is just true in a passionate love but he hates the way he loves and its forbidden
242782 honest to god i didnt see jake and i didnt heath when i saw that movie and i know both of them well one of them better than the other i didnt see them anywhere on the screen

242818 it can be presented in interactive formats to allow each individual to click through to the level that is appropriate to him
242819 that is a welcome clarification and could encourage companies to be more innovative and creative in how they present their disclosures online rather than merely dumping documents in pdf or image based documents that mirror the printed documents
242820 it could also encourage companies to make investments to improve their investor relations web sites and facilitate the use of blogs for communication and investors

242838 at any rate id happily made it to the finish line set up in front of the murakami city hall the race was over i didnt drown didnt get a flat didnt get stung by a vicious jellyfish no ferocious bear hurled himself at me and i wasnt stung by wasps or hit by lightning
242839 ill be happy if running and i can grow old together
242840 taking place as it does in the real world haruki murakamis slim memoir is less strange and beautiful than his fiction instead the author presents the story of his life as a runner in straightforward language charming in its simplicity and honesty murakami frames his development as a novelist as well as his early adventures as a night club entrepreneur within the physical experience of his daily run
242841 what i talk about when i talk about running only provides a few autobiographical details but in the way murakami reveals himself in his day to day running routines and concerns proves quite satisfying as a small memoir theres really not that much to it and yet it gives a good sense of the man
242842 the flat colloquial style that serves to heighten the magical qualities of murakamis fiction makes this work of straightforward nonfiction sound pedestrian

242850 the battle for wine and love or how i saved the world from parkerization
242851 increasingly i find i have a very particular peculiar palate and point of view i often dont taste or see the world in the same way others do
242852 i have a distinct preference for the traditional wines of western europe and a matching skepticism about most of the wines produced in the new world as well as for those wines make in the old world that seek to imitate the characteristics of their new world brethren
242853 but begin to deflate as soon as they are opened like blow up dolls
242854 you couldnt very well serve the most classic dishes from italy with these new wines
242855 as the journalists were slapping high scores on the new wines i retreated to my older collection every time i drank an old barolo i was overwhelmed with remorse there was the italian in me why change such a perfect thing what could i do to make sure these guys who followed the old way these holdouts didnt disappear altogether
242856 there were bad wines and great wines not right wines and wrong wines what you liked was in large part a question of taste a complex concept generally agreed upon to be a reflection of personal preference and part of tasting and understanding wine involved being open to the idea that some wine requires patience and work and is not instantly gratifying

242862 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
242863 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
242864 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie

242887 we have worked with mattel for more than 10 years and the development of a matchbox version of the evora 1 64 model unfolded at the same time as our first evora was being built so there was a lot of excitement and synergy around the two projects the dramatic plan shape and the distinctive graphical detailing of the real car are perfect for a scale model all the design team grew up with matchbox so it was tremendously exciting to work with the company that is in part responsible for inspiring our interest in car design
242888 we have a close long standing relationship with lotus and partnering with them to create a matchbox version of the new evora in advance of its introduction was a unique and exciting opportunity for our designers
242889 the matchbox team was among a handful of people who were privy to the new cars final design our team approached this project with our passion for all things automotive along with a deep understanding of the ethos behind the lotus design

242904 there seems to be this code of silence or lack of trust of the police
242905 as long as im here on this island well be investigating
242906 he is not deteriorating or progressing he is still the same
242907 we have done the best we can and now hope for a medical miracle we never know it could happen
242908 ben he was extremely outgoing had tonnes of energy and was up for almost everything
242909 he was out most days taking kids on trips to watering holes and up mountain tracks in the white mountains in new hampshire
242910 he was well liked by all and was a very funny guy to be around always smiling and enjoying himself
242911 over the coming days the families of ben and catherine will be returning to the uk
242912 ben has been flown home in order for him to receive the best possible medical care catherines body will also be brought back to the uk
242913 the events of the past week have been absolutely devastating for our families and we would once again appeal to the media to turn their attention to helping the police investigation in antigua and to leave us in peace as we attempt to come to terms with what has happened
242914 i grew up with ben and we had great times together when we were young he is one of the nicest guys around and i cant believe this has happened
242915 the medical staff was divided into five teams two teams removed one arm from the donor each two further teams in the neighbouring operating theatre prepared the patient the fifth team removed veins from the donor which we had to transplant to allow for a better blood flow
242916 then we joined the bones with screws and bars under the microscope we could connect the main artery of the arm with a large vein
242917 in addition we were successful in connecting up the fire most important nerves in the arm with the shoulder but that is only the outer casings the nerves must grow into the arms such nerves grow only very slowly so it could take up to two years before he gets feeling in his fingertips
242918 he will have to come to terms with the fact that extremely useful organs that he has been without for so long are back but that they are those of a much younger person
242919 we shall have to tell him to take it easy on the weightlifting getting younger arms might make him feel the years have slipped away but it wont have much affect on his physical strength
242920 he wont play the piano but otherwise he will live much better than before
242921 we have a smoking gun it appears said lonnie j king an official with the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta during the hearing by the agriculture committees subcommittee on horticulture and organic agriculture it also appears likely that more than one food vehicle has been involved in this outbreak
242922 i believe it is a good opportunity for him to show his quality he can bounce back
242923 i expected one of the english teams fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this on one hand its very tough for us but on the other its very exciting
242924 the epa has failed to evaluate the risks from sublethal effects due to low level exposures of the neonicotinoids on honey bees
242925 neonicotinoids have been quantified in the the nectar and the pollen of plants these pesticides can not only kill honey bees outright but also the honey bees ability to fight off infections may also be comprised
242926 federal agencies in france and germany have already taken responsible regulatory actions to suspend use of these pesticides based on the best available scientific evidence but the epa is moving too slowly to take action to suspend nicotinyl pesticides
242927 part of the equation in the u s is genetically engineered corn as more and more corn seeds are being gene spliced with a completely different species a bacterium
242928 bayer and monsanto recently entered into agreements to manufacture neonicotinic coated genetically engineered corn its likely that this will worsen the bee die off problem
242929 its unfortunate that the epa is using double speak they claim to protect our food supply yet they arent doing the proper studies the loss of honeybees will leave a huge void in the kitchens of the american people and an estimated loss of 14 billion dollars to farmers we expect the u s epa to do their job we call for a precautionary moratorium on these powerful crop treatments to protect our bees and our food
242930 we are becoming increasingly concerned that pesticides may affect bees at sublethal levels not killing them outright but rather impairing their behaviors and their abilities to fight off infections
242931 clothianidin is highly toxic to honey bees on an acute basis ld500 439 mg bee it has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees as well as other non target pollinators through the translocation of clothianidin residues in nectar and pollen in honey bees the affects of this toxic chronic exposure may include lethal and sublethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects on the queen
242932 i dont think that the best tactic is to come out with names
242933 if we can do one more signing we will do it but it will need to be quality
242934 we dont need money to buy someone but its not just to buy it has to be the right person that is at the moment very difficult
242935 its not a problem because we have enough young players who can step in
242936 but we lost experience and if we can get a midfielder with experience who can play a tactical role we will do it
242937 i believe we were very unlucky last season as a squad we have made a big improvement last year we lost the premier league by four points
242938 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title
242939 we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
242940 when i was on holiday there was a lot of speculation people were talking on my behalf which is not me
242941 anyone can put what they want in the newspaper you can do it somebody else can do it i never told anyone that i would be leaving this club
242942 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
242943 i have four more years contract i am very happy that we have found a solution to stay here and my heart is with arsenal
242944 all i have to do is play my football and i know the fans always love me so there is no reason to not love me anymore because i am still here
242945 i am very happy being at this club being part of this family
242946 now the most important thing is to keep my head on my shoulders what i did last season is behind me already
242947 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league
242948 it is true we are young but we know that if we put our hearts together and we work as a family we can achieve something
242949 there is a game going on in europe where the big clubs tap up our players
242950 they let us do the work and develop the players and then they think they can just come in and offer him big wages but after they cannot come up with the transfer request it should be the other way round
242951 the rules are quite clear if you want a player you call the club and ask how much they want for him are you ready to sell him
242952 if its no you dont need to speak to the player because no is no

242964 people wish also in the main to give their fellows and themselves the opportunity for self improvement this wish is the vital fact at the bottom of the free compulsorily supported public library it is on these vital facts that we should keep our eyes and our thoughts not on the feature of compulsion work then for the extension of the public library from the starting point of human sympathy from the universal desire for an increase of human happiness by an increase of knowledge of conditions of human happiness

242966 if hillary isnt going to be the first female president who will be
242967 since you ladies were all automatically supporting the girl whos going to get that pretty little vote of yours now
242968 the peculiar gravity of new media holds that all praise is merely prelude to an equal and opposite backlash and both progressed from sweethearts to punching bags in record time
242969 criticism is as useful as praise i eat it like fuel im the little engine that runs on hate my productivity spikes when ive got something to prove and it seems like i always do
242970 a lot of women do get their news from it just as people get their news from jon stewart
242971 should we talk about the mock surprise that every male executive had at the surprise success of sex and the city i believe if you make a good movie whether it speaks to one quadrant or four quadrants they go iron man wouldnt have the success it had if women didnt go
242972 i feel like im getting away with something all the time
242973 our producers are into really good music these days and we are putting forward some very obscure and nontraditional choices and im so happy about that
242974 sounds like the kind of survivalist dystopia normally visited by adolescent boys targeted by the male dominated gaming industry
242975 to paraphrase a great man some see hillary as she is and say then who
242976 were making a magazine show every week and setting the trend
242977 teens have a sensational narcissism and genuinely believe that their experiences are unique and cant be explained to adults
242978 but we forgive them for their mistakes and naivete i love writing about young people
242979 they think well yeah you can do a romantic comedy
242980 well i love a nice romantic comedy and i love something like ray a movie i did that was all about sound that made you feel emotional but i also can sit in a big effects film a big fight scene and go nuts and love it you dont have to prove it as a man if you have a good resume theyre not going to question it but you do have to prove it as a woman

242998 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

243013 regrettably our last meeting with cwu and sacu did not yield positive results
243014 for the period of the industrial action telkom will have extensive contingency measures in place to ensure that the impact on service delivery is kept to a minimum
243015 we very much regret this incident and offer you our sincerest apologies
243016 it was indeed a serious corruption in our files that resulted in the inappropriate image being displayed we understand this may have caused you embarrassment and inconvenience we have taken down the inappropriate materials and have identified and fixed the issue that caused the problem
243017 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
243018 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
243019 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
243020 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
243021 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
243022 i was very sad and i felt like i was a slave
243023 most of the clients we interviewed did not even know what a social security number was or what purpose it served

243028 a georgian mortar platoon is shelling southern districts of tskhinvali
243029 the northern de facto border is also being shelled south ossetia is returning fire
243030 three people have been killed and seven injured as of 21 00 moscow time 17 00 gmt by snipers from the georgian side firing on tskhinvali
243031 georgia has declared a sniper war on the republic of south ossetia and made another attempt to unleash a large scale war
243032 the republic has so far refrained from retaliatory moves but will not do so any more
243033 we have evidence to suggest cr creatine uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
243034 breast cancer shows up on a mammogram or imaging in two different ways a mass lesion or a spot
243035 we feel the breast ct was superior to traditional mammography for mass lesions but mammography remains superior over breast ct for microcalcifications
243036 one of the things that is appealing is comfort on the part of the patient
243037 it has to be just as accurate in finding breast cancer as mammography and should not generate a higher rate of false positives
243038 some say it is supposed to send a message to the iranians as far as i can see the message is that it worked because they had direct talks with the libyans
243039 interest rates will not remain high for ever we will get out of the trough they interest rates will moderate and go back to normal rates hopefully in about six months to a year
243040 banks have an opportunity to mitigate the burden of high interest rate by reducing the cost of money so that they are not obliged to raise interest rate every time the monetary policy is tweaked he said there are ways in which banks can take care of the bottomline even while mitigating the burden of high interest rate upon borrowers the banks must explore those ways
243041 instead of employing and appointing a branch manager banks can appoint a business correspondent without employing one a business correspondent is a barefoot banker and a low cost branch manager who can bring new business by mobilising deposits and create opportunities to advance money

243059 it was pretty obvious out there coming into this tournament i wasnt quite sure if i was going to be able to compete tomorrow i will go for an mri
243060 its tough to go on court and not be close to even 50 percent im too good of a player to go out there and try to fight through something that i think can eventually become something serious
243061 it was a tough one it was the first match since wimbledon so in the beginning obviously i struggled to find my rhythm a little bit
243062 you have to win even if you dont play your best tennis its never easy

243068 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all

243077 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
243078 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
243079 the state constitution and a supreme court decision clearly support the governors action
243080 he is prepared to defend this in court if necessary to protect the states ability to meet its obligations

243082 which if it remains unchecked will swallow up the golden eggs the goose and all her goslings
243083 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
243084 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
243085 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
243086 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
243087 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
243088 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
243089 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

243109 fearing their isolation the wahabi elements are now trying to project themselves as people fighting against injustice to muslims as a whole the decision to organize serial blasts in ahmedabad including four in narendra modis constituency was clearly aimed at getting the sympathy of the muslim masses
243110 there is a big vacuum in muslim leadership and the wahabis are planning to fill the gap with their violent deeds he added
243111 the blasts can have no place in islam but if the indian mujahideens have any grievance then it should appoint a committee to have a dialogue with the government

243210 we now have three balance sheets all coming under pressure at the same time housing consumers and the financial sector
243211 overall the pace of employment growth indicates the economy is settling into a troubling malaise
243212 ford and general motors have announced further production cutbacks automakers are having difficulties securing credit to finance auto leases builders have a 10 month supply of unsold new homes and prices for existing homes fall month after month
243213 what concerns me about the report is the number of different industries that are reporting job losses now
243214 labor market weakness is starting to spread from one industry to the next and is going to accelerating in the coming months combined with the weak housing market the economy will continue limping through the rest of this year and into the next year
243215 some people say im a loner and the truth is i dont think that at all cause i love people

243220 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party

243223 the glk is a compact suv that has everything that is typical for a mercedes benz an expressive design extensive safety features and the typical mercedes benz driving comfort moreover it impresses customers with its outstanding performance in both on and off road applications
243224 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
243225 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
243226 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
243227 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
243228 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
243229 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
243230 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
243231 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
243232 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
243233 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
243234 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
243235 because what sen obama was saying was that hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates and he understands that and he understands that that will be a source of contention but in no way did he say that
243236 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
243237 this is not the john mccain voters thought they would be seeing in this presidential campaign
243238 hes not just embracing the rove playbook that people really are tired of hes taking it to a further extreme
243239 this karl rove style ploy misleads people about baracks energy plan and even mocks his ability to inspire voters and bring americans back into the political process
243240 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
243241 we continue to hold share due to our fuel economy leadership in many truck segments despite dramatic competitive incentive spending increases

243246 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
243247 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
243248 what is the value of access to a failing school
243249 its revamped in light of what he heard from top economic advisors monday and whats happened to the economy over the last two months
243250 its a 50 billion plan designed to prevent more than 1 million americans from losing their jobs and to turn the economy around
243251 there was a bias i believe in terms that we must prove it was tomatoes because that is what the cdc said with their epidemiological evidence
243252 one of the things we noticed very early on when the outbreak took place in texas and new mexico and began to go north of there we were selling tomatoes out of florida all over the southern united states and all over florida but we didnt have sicknesses in florida
243253 we were suspicious right then that florida grown tomatoes were not a part of this problem from the very beginning
243254 is this system broken or does it need a tune up
243255 i would submit today that this system needs a tune up using the tools we have today we also have the very important desire that our producers that are not implicated in an outbreak are not damaged we encourage a better dialogue between fda states growers handlers and retailers to identify good agricultural practices at all levels of the food chain
243256 those kinds of initiatives would encourage fda and cdc to develop improved risk communication tools for future outbreaks to increase the understanding of actual risk probability in suspected items and the risk posed to the public
243257 a good risk analysis would facilitate a greater understanding for all concerned and such improved communications would improve public health rather than create public hysteria
243258 no no the only bus that sells out is the last one of the day and its very rare if that happens but all you need to do is show up one hour prior to your bus leaving and you will be able to get a seat

243320 previously a problem to reproduction pandas lose their interest in mating once in captivity this has led some scientists to try extreme methods such as showing pandas videos of mating pandas 26 the primary reproduction method had been artificial insemination 27 only recently have researchers begun to have success with captive breeding programs and have determined that pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the american black bear a thriving bear family the current reproductive rate is considered one young every two years 6 pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 8 and may be reproductive until age 20 28 the mating season takes place between march and may when a female goes into her estrous cycle which lasts for 2 or 3 days and only occurs once a year 29 during this time two to five males can compete for one female the male with the highest rank gets the female when mating the female is in a crouching head down position as the male mounts her from behind copulation time is short ranging from thirty seconds to five minutes but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization the whole gestation period ranges from 95 to 160 days 29 baby pandas weigh only 90 to 130 grams 3 2 to 4 6 ounces which is about 1 900 of the mothers weight usually the female panda gives birth to one or two panda cubs since baby pandas are born very small and helpless they need the mothers undivided attention so she is able to care for only one of her cubs she usually abandons one of her cubs and it dies soon after birth at this time scientists do not know how the female chooses which cub to raise and this is a topic of ongoing research when the cub is first born it is pink furless and blind it nurses from its mothers breast 6 to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time for three to four hours the mother may leave the den to feed which leaves the panda cub defenseless one to two weeks after birth the cubs skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black a slight pink color may appear on the pandas fur as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mothers saliva a month after birth the color pattern of the cubs fur is fully developed a cubs fur is very soft and coarsens with age the cub begins to crawl at 75 to 90 days mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them the cubs are able to eat small quantities of bamboo after six months though mothers milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg 99 2 pounds at one year and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old the interval between births in the wild is generally two years

243326 an attack on one of societys greatest most traditional foods tampering with fine aged raw milk cheeses is like slashing an ancient painting by a master or shredding the original score of a classic symphony
243327 these cheeses have been with us for thousands of years and the fda is trying to turn us into a nation of velveeta eaters
243328 pasteurization results in increased consistency in the cheesemaking process and more uniform quality in the end product
243329 this translates to a lowering of the flavor bar eliminating the potential to produce a depth and complexity of flavor that can exist with unpasteurized milk cheese
243330 we call on all food loving citizens of the world to respond now to the defense of a food that has for hundreds of years inspired given pleasure and provided sustenance but is now being insidiously undermined by the sterile hand of global hygiene controls

243364 its the first thing on our mind whenever we think of anything new for the game
243365 to be frank skate culture is one thats used to being appropriated our goal originally was to not appropriate it but to kind of become part of it and i think weve succeeded
243366 we didnt get into this to say lets bury another game for us it was theres a skateboarding game out there it does well and people like playing it but we had a different thing we wanted to do and we did
243367 for skate we were making a skating game first and foremost we wanted to make sure that was right in the time that we had to get the game out we wanted to make sure that the skating was perfect and as a result we decided not to focus on off board stuff at the time
243368 obviously that freedom is a big part of skate 2 you can take it and create your own lines and customize your environment to create your perfect ideal skating experience were creating a great toy that allows people to express themselves

243375 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
243376 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
243377 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
243378 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke or mrs albright is or whether that arm can reach me here
243379 such a deal never existed he told swedish public radio friday
243380 both holbrooke and i were actively involved in the 1990s in an attempt to get nato to intervene to have him arrested
243381 who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal protection
243382 everything takes place in an atmosphere in which regardless of what truths may be demonstrated in this room no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
243383 with the reduction in advertising revenue and circulation along with the most dramatic increase in newspaper printing capacity we have ever seen in the uk it is inevitable that this will continue to happen news international is desperate to fill its 85 000 copies per hour presses until they have virtually cornered the market then watch their prices go up we will do everything we can to alleviate the affect this has on our members most of who have worked in the industry for many decades

243413 the economy is certainly not going to be a positive for the republicans
243414 it is a decent margin but it is not a landslide
243415 it would have been much larger if there had been a recession in 2008
243416 this model has correctly predicted the winning party 12 out of 14 times
243417 the weak current state of the economy and the sharp rise in energy prices pose a significant headwind to the mccain campaign if voters weigh these factors similarly to how they have in the past

243422 this opinion piece link below discusses what is perhaps the most significant psychological mechanism acting to help make the jewish community support israels occupation the fear of collective annihilation seth freedman argues that a culture of fear like this has a life of its own independent of whether it is grounded in something real and indeed has a tendency to create objects of fear where there are none of course this psychology is very much in the interests of those who seek to perpetuate the occupation and who encourage this culture of fear thus a people as victimized oppressed dispossessed and essentially powerless as the palestinians under occupation is magnified into a monster that threatens the existence of a nuclear armed state this is a neat argument and explains for instance the disproportionate hysteria over the qassam rocket attacks while it is fairly easy to use blunt geopolitical reasoning explain the motivations behind the occupation it is always more difficult to explain why so many jews in israel and around the world support such cruelty analyses such as this go a long way towards such an explanation
243423 history has handed the jewish people the fear of annihilation on a plate but while the fear exists what is feared may not

243425 late last year congress agreed to a request from president bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations against iran according to current and former military intelligence and congressional sources
243426 this president has read it this way anything that has to do with the military even if its intelligence collection by the military is part of warfare preparing the battlefield
243427 so one of the things the special operations troops are doing is trying to escalate the amount of incidents inside iran trying to get more stuff going more terrorism more bombings more internal disturbances and hopes maybe in the fantasy football world in the vice presidents office in hopes that the iranian government would crack down on the minorities big time

243473 when i was a baby in the womb i kicked whenever anyone mentioned glenn hoddle my first memory is watching the 1982 cup final when spurs beat queens park rangers and since then it has always been my dream to play for them i only eat walkers crisps just to feel closer to gary lineaker even though i have played for another team all my life and never visited england without the russian national team i am as spurs mad as bobby zamora or dimitar berbatov
243474 but now i see hes just living his dream to play for sunderland and who can possibly complain about that thatll be why he went to spurs in the first place
243475 i can see why people would think that an ex barcelona youngster who was born raised in and started playing for barcelona who came through the barcelona youth team and who went to his first barcelona game at the age of 9 months would have more pride and loyalty than to sign for their biggest rivals real madrid
243476 that would undoubtedly be quite disloyal the thing is though im not one of those people i know why you may think that what with all the barcelona memorabilia i used to have in my room as a kid and the pictures of me training with the barca youth team actually though thats all a mistake the blue and red bedspread i used to sleep in was actually due to my life long devotion to aldershot town who play in the same colours and when you think you see me in a barca shirt its actually just my dads stripey pyjama top

243532 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
243533 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
243534 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
243535 the good news is that from nellies testimony under oath i got to find out the truth of what happened prior to nellie taking the warriors job and it certainly was not what was said publicly
243536 sometimes finding the truth is expensive in this case i just have to pay him what i would have had to pay him anyway and some legal fees so it didnt cost too much in fact it was a small price to pay in any event now warriors fans get to enjoy and appreciate the drama queen that is don nelson
243537 congress shouldnt leave its business unfinished while american wallets are drained at the pump
243538 let us demand that the president of the united states call a special session of this congress on energy
243539 who died and made you sole arbiter of who can and cannot sculpt porcelain elephants
243540 i know you guys have a job to do and im happy to answer as much and as often as i can for you guys
243541 i have a lot of expectations on the way i feel i should play and i know the guys in the locker room believe in me and that management believes in me
243542 its just gonna be doing the things quarterbacks coach tom clements has taught us to do managing the game taking the big play when we have opportunities and pulling back when we dont making the most of our opportunities i believe the time i put in during the offseason is going to pay off
243543 im going to be myself and be the best quarterback i can be
243544 if he comes back to the team well welcome him back as a part of this team but thats up to him and the management
243545 when the decision finally comes down i think well be able to bring him in and move forward together before all this stuff went down i was the starting quarterback and that was my focus as of this moment im still the starting quarterback
243546 i talked to his daughter his nephew and his sister at the espys july 17
243547 they reiterated the fact i already knew theres no issue between me and brett when he was here we got along great we joked around and spent time together off the field its never been about me and brett its about brett and the organization trying to find the resolution that both parties are happy with i know my role lead this team and if he comes back well welcome him back
243548 obviously we are ready to shock mazembe at their own backyard and we are confident it will be a positive one for us

243628 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
243629 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s
243630 and i managed to take advantage of another par 5 for a birdie i think anything in the 60s is going to be pretty good today
243631 i know its a record for me and i was hoping it was an lpga record i was going for the fourth at 14 but i ran it by from 30 feet i thought i hit a good putt went past it didnt even make birdie
243632 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
243633 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
243634 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
243635 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
243636 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money
243637 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
243638 id say today was like yesterday i play 15 good holes and then again i leave a few shots out there i just cant do that not in this type of championship its costing me too much and then i always have to do catchup and ive not been able to do that
243639 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
243640 i birdied the first two holes it was nice to take advantage of the two par 5s

243651 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator

243653 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
243654 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
243655 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign
243656 thats not to say that we have not received help from a lot of the people in the obama campaign
243657 were still a little bit short but im not worried about it
243658 the obama campaign is on the ground and theyre helping out and you know well have all the money that we need to pay everybody on time according to their contracts

243678 mention of migration is a delicate issue leading to accusations of racism which has become formally an illegal activity
243679 personally i have no hesitation to admit to being a racist in an expanding world there might be room for everyone but in a contracting one it makes sense for each tribe to look after itself as well as it can already the indigenous dutch find themselves almost outnumbered in their overcrowded home being now forced to emigrate in increasing numbers to places like australia having been squeezed out by newcomers

243698 in a recent internal memo microsoft ceo steve ballmer discussed the various threats to the company including the surging apple
243699 in its just filed 10 k microsoft introduces a new risk factor that wasnt there last year a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players
243700 theres obviously just one company they could be talking about there
243701 apple takes an integrated approach to the pc experience and has made inroads in share particularly in the u s and in the consumer segment windows mobile software and services faces substantial competition from apple nokia openwave systems palm qualcomm research in motion and symbian
243702 pc hardware is also low margin because the hardware is a commodity as the os is the differentiator
243703 we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins

243708 we were there to support each other and if we had questions have someone to talk with
243709 it makes them very self conscious and not trusting of people
243710 the first night he came home he started screaming in our bed something about get down incoming guns yes sir heard roger it was frightening i was thinking what happens if he starts swinging i got out of bed and slept on the couch he didnt take offense to it it takes them a while to get back into the rhythm of being a civilian again were still not there
243711 he was quick to temper and did not trust me anymore
243712 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different
243713 im supposed to understand their feelings but it doesnt seem like they understand me
243714 when we had the veterans party there were no balloons because we had been warned that if even one popped it could set them off
243715 a neighbor shot off fireworks and it was pretty loud a trigger for paul
243716 i ran around the house and hes laying with his face in the ground patting the grass
243717 the next year on the fourth of july neighbors in dover were setting them off and my husband was on the floor trying to get under the bed
243718 every time one went off hed fall down i called police they understood and shut it down
243719 we ended up losing our duplex and with four kids moved to the projects in dover
243720 my two oldest got out of control hanging with the wrong crowd
243721 i called the manchester va and explained the paranoia the high anxiety he was either not sleeping for days or just sleeping and not changing clothes they said admit him and he stayed two months they put him on meds and counseled him
243722 i headed to hansom air force base and asked if i could stay in their lodging
243723 they gave me three days the airman family readiness group jumped in and extended my leave the save program called me and said we understand youre in trouble and will help you
243724 save said they were looking for people to start a support group through them and asked if i was interested yeah i was interested
243725 they asked no questions and even agreed to shut down a few hours once a month so thered be no gunshots

243736 new album is a bomb a disaster a catastrophe two years ago his last album sold 355 000 copies in its first week and this one has sold 187 000 copies not good i hope im not a racist for pointing that out
243737 when we last left this rapper he was calling fox racist in a pathetic attempt to promote his new album as we reported the album is a bomb it opened weak and in its second week dropped 66 percent in sales normally we wouldnt gloat over something like that but nas is a bad guy in addition to being a pinhead
243738 nas first week is lighter than the 355 000 unit start of hip hop is dead not uncommon in todays music climate and all the more understandable when you consider that his 2006 album hit stores during the busiest shopping week of the year
243739 this in fact marks nas first studio set to arrive outside the confines of november or december since his 1999 title

243744 hashrocket ultra productive in 3 days is a definitely intriguing i think every company wishes they could push out that kind of productivity in three days at techcrunch we would like to see if their three day game plan can work for bigger projects as well we would still be going from concept to completion in three days but completion would mark completion of one or more features not the entire product basically every three days set up a game plan for three days from now anything that cant be completed within three days either needs to be pushed back or broken into more manageable pieces it would take multiple sets of 3 day pushes but it would help by keeping us focused and on a regular release cycle

243755 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
243756 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
243757 exaggerating or disposed to exaggerate ones own worth or importance often by an overbearing manner
243758 its definitely clear that the rs is not part of such a scenario because she has her legitimacy
243759 the problem is that some people in sarajevo should wake up look left and right and realise that the rs is there it will remain there permanently
243760 just one of the ideologists of the project of genocide and ethnic cleansing
243761 karadzic and his followers have invented such a project which was realised because of active and continuous participation of all institutions of the self proclaimed republika srpska
243762 not only to determine his individual responsibility for the project of genocide and ethnic cleansing but also for the correction of the effects of that project

243768 obesity is a significant risk factor when considering operative procedures particularly due to secondary conditions such as hypertension diabetes sleep apnea cardiovascular disease and poor healing that generally accompany it
243769 these findings lay the groundwork for establishing evidence based medicine guidelines to better assist us in evaluating patients for potential risk when considering these increasingly popular procedures and in weighing those risks against the potential benefits in our varied patients

243787 movie stars and athletes have a very hard time mixing

243789 it was always they want the black guy to die in the first five minutes of the movie and have the white guy revenge his death so i said okay hell ill make my own movie and direct my own movie and i know damn well im not gonna die

243795 the federal law does not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession
243796 the purpose of the federal law is to combat recreational drug use not to regulate a states medical practices
243797 we think the court should have found that californias medical marijuana laws are pre empted by the federal law
243798 we think the id card law requires us to issue cards in support of conduct that violates federal law

243802 it wasnt just on farscape where i did that a few times i did that in the series finale of stargate sg 1 too
243803 it would have been great as an actor to explore that story line but i understand this is an action driven show and sometimes character development is going to be sacrificed to the action
243804 we were excited we told our friends and family the good news did whatever little things we could to prepare ourselves to be parents

243815 back in april the new jersey department of health put in a request that the agency the u s consumer product safety commission take a closer look at artificial turf fields this came after they found that many of the older fields began to emit levels of lead which they believed could have posed a health risk the commission followed up by studying the artificial fields and the amount of lead
243816 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church

243820 the evidence is consistent with the idea that at least initially more robust enforcement caused the number of illegal immigrants to decline significantly

243822 tell me how 3 verses in romans 1 provides for a prescriptive theology of the state
243823 i have no come to abolish the law but fulfill it
243824 i have not come to abolish the law but to destroy it
243825 do we make void the law through faith nay rather we establish the law
243826 one should not come to the testimony of scripture predisposed toward the idea that there is discontinuity between the ethical standards governing israel and those which god uses to judge the nations

243831 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church

243839 nakshatra was discontinued by aishwarya it is false news that she lost out the endorsement to katrina kaif aishwarya had some conditions and the company did not come to terms with this so she called it off
243840 endorsements are not a competition nobody loses an endorsement it is just that sometimes the technicalities dont work out between the endorser and the brand at the end of the day an endorser is asked to endorse a product because ones image looks best suited to the brand
243841 the experience is wonderful the tour is meant to reach people who dont get to see enough of bollywood action live it is wonderful to perform on stage

243845 blogs are a wonderful way of reaching out to audiences i would like to blog but i dont really have the time
243846 the resistance is now stronger than before and this keeps the option of war awake if we were weak israel would not hesitate to start another war
243847 we are stronger than before and when hezbollah is strong our strength stops israel from starting a new war
243848 we are proud of our friendship with iran and with syria and every country that helps us to gain our rights
243849 all parties in lebanon are getting weapons no one asks from where
243850 we are confident we have whoever we were looking for the actor in this manner

243852 a breakdown of the marriage relationship to the extent that the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved
243853 como con m dula y grosura est saciada mi alma y con labios jubilosos te alaba mi boca cuando en mi lecho me acuerdo de ti en ti medito durante las vigilias de la noche
243854 como el ciervo anhela las corrientes de agua as suspira por ti oh dios el alma m a mi alma tiene sed de dios del dios viviente cu ndo vendr y me presentar delante de dios
243855 cuando mi coraz n se llen de amargura y en mi interior sent a punzadas entonces era yo torpe y sin entendimiento era como una bestia delante de ti
243856 ha cambiado alguna naci n sus dioses aunque sos no son dioses pues mi pueblo ha cambiado su gloria por lo que no aprovecha espantaos oh cielos por esto y temblad quedad en extremo desolados declara el se or porque dos males ha hecho mi pueblo me han abandonado a m fuente de aguas vivas y han cavado para s cisternas cisternas agrietadas que no retienen el agua
243857 cuando estaba en el desierto de jud oh dios t eres mi dios te buscar con af n mi alma tiene sed de ti mi carne te anhela cual tierra seca y rida donde no hay agua
243858 yo fui a mi casa y llor porque nosotros no adoramos en mi iglesia de la manera que t lo haces en la tuya

243862 la raz n por la que quiero salir a solas contigo esta noche es porque encuentro placer estando contigo
243863 a los 30 a os o m s la poes a en su diversidad me dieron un gran placer anteriormente las fotograf as me produjeron placer considerable y la m sica gran deleite pero ahora y desde hace a os no puedo resistir leer una l nea de poes a tambi n he perdido casi todo el sentido del gusto por las fotograf as y la m sica retengo algo de gusto por buenos paisajes pero no me dan el exquisito deleite que sent a anteriormente mi mente parece haberse convertido en una especie de m quina procesando leyes generales a partir de una colecci n de hechos
243864 los cielos cuentan la gloria de dios y el firmamento anuncia la obra de sus manos
243865 cristo si esto es s lo la chispa cuando afilas tu espada c mo ser el d a de tu advenimiento
243866 porque como el rel mpago que sale del oriente y se muestra hasta el occidente as ser tambi n la venida del hijo del hombre
243867 cuando jes s hab a cruzado de nuevo en la barca a la otra orilla se congreg alrededor de l una gran multitud
243868 mi hija est muy enferma le est n dando convulsiones tiene usted una ba era donde la podamos meter en agua caliente
243869 ven pon las manos sobre ella para que sea salva y viva
243870 hab a una mujer que sufr a de hemorragia desde hac a doce a os
243871 cuando oy hablar de jes s vino por detr s de l entre la multitud y toc su manto porque ella pensaba si s lo toco su manto ser sanada al instante se sec la fuente de su sangre y sinti en su cuerpo que ya estaba sana de aquel azote
243872 si puedo tocarle nada m s solo tocarle me curar
243873 de pronto jes s reconociendo dentro de s que hab a salido poder de l volvi ndose a la multitud dijo qui n me ha tocado el manto sus disc pulos le dijeron ves la multitud que te apretuja y preguntas qui n me toc el miraba alrededor para ver a la que hab a hecho esto entonces la mujer temiendo y temblando sabiendo lo que en ella hab a sido hecho fue y se postr delante de l y le dijo toda la verdad el le dijo hija tu fe te ha salvado vete en paz y queda sana de tu azote
243874 no hago yo las obras sino el padre que mora en mi
243875 hija tu fe te ha salvado vete literalmente en paz y queda sanada de tu azote
243876 mientras l a n hablaba mientras jes s le estaba a n hablando a la mujer vinieron de la casa del principal de la sinagoga diciendo tu hija ha muerto para qu molestas mas al maestro pero jes s sin hacer caso a esta palabra que se dec a dijo al principal de la sinagoga no temas solo cree y no permiti que nadie le acompa ara sino pedro jacobo y juan el hermano de jacobo llegaron a la casa del principal de la sinagoga y l vio el alboroto y los que lloraban y lamentaban mucho y al entrar les dijo por qu hac is alboroto y llor is la ni a no ha muerto sino que duerme ellos se burlaban de l
243877 pero l los sac a todos y tom al padre y a la madre de la ni a y a los que estaban con l y entr a donde estaba la ni a tom la mano de la ni a y le dijo talita cumi que traducido es ni a a ti te digo lev ntate y en seguida la ni a se levant y andaba pues ten a doce a os y quedaron at nitos
243878 eso est bien ye le do la historia de c mo san a la mujer y c mo resucit a la ni a pero no ha hecho eso conmigo estoy enfermo y l no me ha sanado mis seres amados est n en la tumba aunque yo tambi n quer a recuperarlos por qu no responde de igual manera hoy en d a
243879 el les mand estrictamente que nadie lo supiese y orden que le diese a ella de comer
243880 me cuesta trabajo hablar acerca de este asunto sin sentir que me afecta personalmente y sin que me traiga recuerdos pues me hace pensar en lo que pas hace cuarenta a os cuando mi primera hija estuvo al borde de la muerte acud a dios y el acudi y nos dijo de un modo a nuestros corazones acongojados
243881 sali de all y fue a su tierra y sus disc pulos le siguieron y cuando lleg el s bado l comenz a ense ar en la sinagoga y muchos quedaban at nitos cuando le o an y dec an de d nde le viene a ste estas cosas qu sabidur a es sta que le ha sido dada cu ntas obras poderosas son hechas por sus manos no es ste el carpintero hijo de mar a y hermano de jacobo de jos de jud s y de sim n no est n tambi n sus hermanas aqu con nosotros y se escandalizaban de l pero jes s les dec a no hay profeta sin honra sino en su propia tierra entre sus familiares y en su casa y no pudo hacer all ning n hecho poderoso sino que san a unos pocos enfermos poniendo sobre ellos las manos estaba asombrado a causa de la incredulidad de ellos y recorr a las aldeas de alrededor ense ando
243882 de d nde le vienen a ste estas cosas qu sabidur a es sta que le ha sido dada cu ntas obras poderosas son hechas por sus manos
243883 no puede ser nada porque nosotros le conocemos y estamos enterados de sus principios conocemos a su familia y sabemos de d nde vino
243884 levantad la vista y mirad mas all de lo visible a las realidades de dios vivid en toda la plenitud de las dimensiones de la vida como dios quiso que lo hicieseis
243885 no sig is siendo incr dulos solo creed y tened fe en que yo estoy obrando y enriquecer vuestras vidas mas all de vuestros mas incre bles sue os

243891 it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reexamine standardized initial treatment and retreatment regimens
243892 failure to act now will mean far more resources will be needed in the long run to address global drug resistance
243893 are decades old complex to use time consuming and more importantly not designed for case management of multidrug resistant tb
243894 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
243895 as a group we have some significant holes to fill but at the same time i think we have quality people who will fill those holes
243896 last year i was the one breaking in new guys and new backups
243897 the item you tried to buy is no longer available
243898 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time well do our best to try to get the application back onto the app store if at all possible at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering
243899 netshare is a socks sockets proxy for the iphone it allows users access to the internet on their computer through their iphone while on the go the connection is made over edge or 3g
243900 apple wouldnt care and i dont think apple does care
243901 at the same time they have service agreements with the carriers that they need to abide by
243902 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it
243903 we offer laptopconnect cards that you can use to access our wireless data network those cards offer typical download speeds as high as 1 7 mbps megabits per second
243904 to me i dont see why it would cannibalize their business i see it as an opportunity not to be missed
243905 most people dont tether and they tend to let carriers lead them around by the nose
243906 a me rappelle les vacances santa teresa quels bons souvenirs
243907 if during that hearing the dogs are found to be dangerous there are any number of things that can occur including impoundment and euthanasia

243949 the laboratory has been at the center of the fbis investigation of the anthrax attacks that killed five people

243953 adding our vet centers and their clinical screening capability into the mix of the national guards reintegration efforts takes new yorks programs to assist its returning guardsmen and their families to unprecedented levels of support and care for their well being
243954 this is exactly the type of cooperation between state and federal government that our veterans expect of us
243955 this program has been very successful in several new england states in identifying soldiers with readjustment problems and we are happy to expand it to new york
243956 we consider it a real privilege to be able to speak with these soldiers
243957 as with all health problems mental health issues are best dealt with early and close to home offering mental health screenings as part of the reintegration process will lead to early identification and support for those returning soldiers who are struggling to deal with the stresses of deployment and war

243972 years of backing an anti soviet jihad has left its mark
243973 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taleban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan
243974 we need to identify these people and weed them out
243975 there is no question of any purge in the isi
243976 the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing it was in the past during the soviet jihad that a few pro taleban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out

243983 protect the city we shall overpower the enemy forces charge
243984 so what happened to you kye the last time we saw you you looked a lot different
243985 i have been in the province of indala in the far southeastern edge of mystia training with the arch mage in the great tower of the ancients
243986 ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention please my name is lorm and i have been charged by the king to make sure that all of you have a safe and enjoyable stay here at the great hall tonight we have a special guest the legendary troubadour lament lamont here to tell us a story lets all give him a hand
243987 king uther brightblade met a beautiful young princess from the kingdom of indala named princess montoya
243988 he must have really loved her i hope that someday someone loves me like that
243989 i wouldnt hold your breath if i were you willow
243990 does anyone have any ideas about what we will do or where we will go on our journey
243991 i have in my possession an ancient map that leads to a place known as the forgotten citadel the forgotten citadel is a structure built by the ancients much the same as the kings palace in astoria it is rumored to be the final resting place to countless magical treasures and untold fortunes of gold and jewels i think we should go there
243992 legend says the riches sealed beneath the forgotten citadel are so great that they would make even the worlds richest kings look like paupers
243993 i would love to have more gold than the king how about you vargas
243994 sure im looking forward to my share of the treasure
243995 but you know it wont be nearly as easy of a task as it sounds certainly there is some mythical dragon or great beast protecting such a legendary treasure or someone else would have taken it by now
243996 nobody has ever come back from the forgotten citadel alive
243997 i have a map that will guide us across mystia and to the forgotten citadel safely there are many challenges ahead that could stop us from succeeding the path to the forgotten citadel will most certainly be dangerous terrain we will each stare death in the face more than once and some of us might not even live through the perils ahead but the rewards are well worth the risks
243998 doesnt this sound just a little too dangerous to anyone else maybe we should find somewhere else to go perhaps somewhere a little less deadly i hear the valley of the unicorn is really pretty this time of year
243999 i think we should go to the forgotten citadel it sounds like a real challenge dont you think
244000 actually craven i think this idea sounds really scary if nobody has ever come back from this place before what makes you think that we will be any different
244001 we need to leave this place at dawn so everyone should try to get some rest tonight
244002 the waitress should be back here in a minute can i get either of you another drink
244003 i think that i am going to bed it has been a really long day for me and we all heard kye say that we need to leave early in the morning
244004 i should probably be headed toward bed as well ill walk you to your room willow
244005 do you think that we are going to be alright craven
244006 im really worried about going to such a deadly place it seems really dangerous i dont know what i would do if anything happened to one of us
244007 dont worry willow everything is going to be just fine i will keep you safe i promise
244008 i know that if you are helping to keep me safe nothing bad could possibly happen im sure that you could protect me from anything
244009 im not sure i have ever seen such an evil looking statue
244010 im not really sure what inspired this statue we found it in arch mage rayeks tower when we were cleaning it some time ago i am taking it down to the basement with such valuable gems for eyes im sure the king would be quite upset if anything were to happen to it certainly it would be better kept locked up with the other treasure
244011 i will sleep much better tonight knowing that evil thing isnt going to be anywhere close to my room i hope i dont have nightmares tonight having just seem it
244012 i hope that you sleep well tonight i assure you that i will keep it locked up tight
244013 goodnight craven i hope that you sleep well i will see you in the morning you should try to get some rest we have a big day ahead of us tomorrow

244026 ik kan nog altijd niet geloven wat er tegen bate gebeurd is die scheidsrechter was een komiek

244028 wat we woensdag zagen was een catastrofaal scenario nu moeten we ginder al gaan stunten als zij hier met 1 2 kunnen winnen moeten wij dat ginder ook kunnen als het mislukt is het natuurlijk een grote streep door de rekening ik geef toe dat we geen budget hebben zonder europees voetbal dat betekent dus dat we ons budget nog eens met 3 miljoen zullen moeten inkrimpen als het volgende week misloopt

244030 the household of muhammad did not possess except a sa of food grain barley etc for both the morning and the evening meals although they were nine houses
244031 who would kill kab bin al ashraf as he has harmed allah and his apostle
244032 i want a loan of one or two wasqs of food grains
244033 how can we mortgage our women and you are the most handsome among the arabs
244034 how can we mortgage our sons as the people will abuse them for being mortgaged for one or two wasqs of food grains it is shameful for us but we will mortgage our arms to you
244035 one can ride the mortgaged animal because of what one spends on it and one can drink the milk of a milch animal as long as it is mortgaged
244036 the mortgaged animal can be used for riding as long as it is fed and the milk of the milch animal can be drunk according to what one spend on it the one who rides the animal or drinks its milk should provide the expenditures
244037 whoever took a false oath in order to grab somebodys property will meet allah while allah will be angry with him
244038 produce two witnesses to support your claim otherwise the defendant has the right to take an oath to refute your claim i said the defendant would not mind to take a false oath
244039 allahs apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed abu ubaida bin al jarrah as their chief and the army consisted of three hundred men including myself we marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish abu ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected my our journey food was dates abu ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it till it was exhausted the share of everyone of us used to be one date only
244040 we came to know its value when even that too finished
244041 when we reached the sea shore we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain the army ate from it for eighteen days then abu ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the ground then he ordered that a she camel be ridden and it passed under the two ribs forming an arch without touching them
244042 o allahs apostle how would they survive after slaughtering their camels
244043 call upon the people to bring what has remained of their food
244044 i testify that none has the right to be worshipped but allah and i am his apostle
244045 when the people of ashari tribe ran short of food during the holy battles or the food of their families in medina ran short they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl so these people are from me and i am from them
244046 we were in the company of the prophet at dhul hulaifa
244047 some of these animals are like wild animals so if you lose control over one of these animals treat it in this way i e shoot it with an arrow
244048 we may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives can we slaughter the animals with reeds
244049 use whatever causes blood to flow and eat the animals if the name of allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them do not slaughter with teeth or fingernails and i will tell you why it is because teeth are bones i e cannot cut properly and fingernails are the tools used by the ethiopians whom we should not imitate for they are infidels
244050 dont eat two dates together at a time as the prophet has forbidden eating two dates together at a time in a gathering unless one takes the permission of ones companion brother
244051 allahs apostle said if one manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave and can afford the price of the other shares according to the adequate price of the slave the slave will be completely manumitted otherwise he will be partially manumitted
244052 aiyub a sub narrator is not sure whether the saying
244053 whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely by paying the remaining price and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him then the price of the slave should be estimated justly and he is to be allowed to work and earn the amount that will manumit him without overburdening him
244054 the example of the person abiding by allahs order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat some of them got seats in the upper part and the others in the lower when the latter needed water they had to go up to bring water and that troubled the others so they said let us make a hole in our share of the ship and get water saving those who are above us from troubling them so if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested all the people of the ship would be destroyed but if they prevented them both parties would be safe
244055 if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry other women of your choice two or three or four
244056 o my nephew this is about the orphan girl who lives with her guardian and shares his property her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate mahr bridal money which might have been given by another suitor so such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable mahr otherwise they were ordered to marry any other woman
244057 after that verse the people again asked the prophet about the marriage with orphan girls so allah revealed the following verses they ask your instruction concerning the women say allah instructs you about them and about what is recited unto you in the book concerning the orphan girls to whom you give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you desire to marry
244058 allahs saying in the other verse yet whom you desire to marry 4 127 means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has not much property or beauty in which case he should treat her justly the guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them as they generally refrain from marrying them when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy
244059 the right of pre emption is valid in every joint property but when the land is divided and the way is demarcated then there is no right of pre emption
244060 i and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on credit
244061 i and my partner zaid bin al arqam did the same and then went to the prophet and asked him about it
244062 o allahs apostle take the pledge of allegiance from him
244063 be our partner as the prophet invoked allah to bless you
244064 whoever manumits his share o a jointly possessed slave it is imperative on him to manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of its price which is to be estimated justly he should pay his partners their shares and release him the freed one
244065 whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money otherwise he should look for some work for the slave to earn what would enable him to emancipate himself without overburdening him with work
244066 shall we go to mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs
244067 i have been informed that some peoples were saying so and so by allah i fear allah more than you do and am more obedient to him than you if i had known what i know now i would not have brought the hadi sacrifice with me and had the hadi not been with me i would have finished the ihram
244068 o allahs apostle is this permission for us only or is it forever
244069 we were in the valley of dhul hulaifa of tuhama in the company of the prophet and had some camels and sheep of the booty
244070 yes or you can use what would make blood flow slaughter and you can eat what is slaughtered and the name of allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering
244071 i have to ask did your mom ever get her glasses great fn movie man

244077 technological advances have dramatically transformed the provision of financial services in our economy
244078 notably increasing sophisticated information technologies enable lenders to collect and process data necessary to value and price risk much more efficiently than in the past
244079 although the severity of the financial stresses became apparent only in august 2007 several longer term development served as prologue for the recent turmoil the first of these was the u s housing boom which began in the mid 1990s a second critical development was an even broader credit boom in which lenders and investors aggressively sought out new opportunities to take credit risk even as contracted

244094 q why do vietnam vets welcome each other home a quite simply because no one else really ever did when our soldiers returned from southeast asia they were warned to remove their uniforms before passing through the airport terminal or be prepared to deal with the taunts of protesters later they were advised to remove their tour of duty from resumes and professional documents lest they be perceived as unstable or haunted thousands of young men and women returned to the states with stories and memories but no one wanted to hear them after over 15 years of involvement in vietnam the public wanted to forget unfortunately in our attempt to forget vietnam we also forgot to thank all those who served there with honor and courage so in 1994 after waiting fifteen years i felt it was only fitting and proper that myself and all my vietnam brothers were made proud and whole as i can never erase the scene of my being accosted by my fellow americans and peppered with rotten eggs and tomatoes as i was being released from fitzsimmons general hospital in denver co on 12 feb 1967 i was headed to stapleton international airport to have after 20 months a long awaited for and truly deserved reunion with my wife and family in wisconsin i had to have a military and civilian police escort back to the hospital where i was issued a completely new uniform and then escorted to the airport to complete my return from vietnam

244107 the public square or marketplace of an ancient roman city forming the center of judicial and public business
244108 provocative pragmatic and inspiring discussions about the changing nature and roles of philanthropy in our global society
244109 one of the reasons there is so little information about the unintended or unanticipated consequences of philanthropic interventions is that there are so few foundations let alone philanthropists that talk about what they hope to accomplish
244110 philanthropy is difficult work not just because social change is the product of a large variety of forces that are hard to identify much less affect with any certainty but because unlike the financial returns of a business or even the electoral returns in politics philanthropy has no common measure of success
244111 all of this means that accomplishing philanthropic goals requires having great clarity about what those goals are and specifying indicators of success before beginning a philanthropic project
244112 we concluded that we needed to focus our energies in order to have even greater impact in everything we do we want to foster leadership continually build on the knowledge we gain and choose activities that have a high potential to make a significant impact

244130 last year alone the fda rejected approval for five new cancer drugs including a breakthrough treatment for prostate cancer called provenge although a panel of cancer experts that advises fda on new drug approvals unanimously agreed that provenge was safe and voted 13 to 4 that it was effective fda demanded still more testing that may delay approval for three more years unfortunately the provenge rejection is not unusual and this extra agency caution doesnt actually improve drug safety

244132 thanks to environmental activists and busybody lawmakers bottled water may soon be more expensive and less accessible they say bottled water is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible and they are pushing a host of silly laws to tax ban or otherwise hinder access to the product among the anti bottled water complaints is the claim that making and transporting bottled water uses too much oil and that switching to tap water could significantly reduce u s oil consumption yet even if everyone stopped drinking bottled water u s oil consumption would decrease just 0 02 percent based on figures found in a recent new york times article criticizing bottled water

244134 earlier this year texas changed its law to allow renewable energy projects like pickens wind farm to obtain rights of way by piggybacking on a water districts eminent domain power so pickens can now use his water districts authority to also condemn land for his future wind farms transmission lines who will pay for the rights of way and the transmission lines and pipelines thanks to another gift from texas politicians pickens water district can sell tax free taxpayer guaranteed municipal bonds to finance the 2 2 billion cost of the water pipeline and then earlier this month the texas legislature voted to spend 4 93 billion for wind farm transmission lines while pickens has denied that this money is earmarked for him he nevertheless is building the largest wind farm in the world

244154 this was especially true due to existing relationship with chesapeake on gulf mountain wma and the lucrative nature of ongoing talks with them concerning the north half of the areas minerals
244155 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
244156 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
244157 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
244158 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
244159 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
244160 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money
244161 even if cuils index is three times larger than any competitors its not clear that means better search results for users many of whom dont scroll past the first page and are seeking the most relevant results rather than the most results
244162 seeing cuil trot out size figures is incredibly disheartening and a step backwards not forwards time better spent on other things such as measuring the relevancy of the results will instead get consumed by those trying to count pages
244163 seeing as how new search engine cuil com is well a search engine its founders might have known that people could easily check online the companys claim that the word cuil means knowledge in irish because in fact it doesnt
244164 if you invented a more efficient way to build an automatic transmission im not so sure that the right response is to start a car company
244165 now that we have a candidate it has definitely helped in our efforts
244166 before you had a lot of people on the sidelines saying let me see who the nominee is and then well talk
244167 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
244168 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
244169 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
244170 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
244171 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign
244172 thats not to say that we have not received help from a lot of the people in the obama campaign
244173 were still a little bit short but im not worried about it
244174 the obama campaign is on the ground and theyre helping out and you know well have all the money that we need to pay everybody on time according to their contracts

244182 pat lewis stories in the claws come out ooze originality and charm ranging from delightfully shocking pantomime to sitcom ready characterization doused in a fresh coat of blood not since the likes of topper or bell book and candle has there been an occult romantic comedy that so successfully balances witty slice of life dialogue against blackly comic thrills
244183 amma what if you forget to wish me on my bday tomorrow
244184 i think everybody knows its business when it comes down to contract time
244185 all these died in faith without receiving the promises but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth for those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own and indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out they would have had opportunity to return but as it is they desire a better country that is a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them
244186 they would have found constant opportunity to return to it
244187 let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
244188 seeing that his divine power has granted to us meaning he has already given it to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence
244189 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union

244198 sebenarnya sejak 2008 rakyat irak sudah cukup kuat meski tak ada pasukan asing kami toh bisa menjaga kondisi keamanan yang stabil memang sebelumnya kami akui kami tak mampu menangani keamanan tetapi sekarang sudah mampu
244199 tetapi ini tidak berarti sekarang di irak tak ada konflik tetap saja masih ada namun yang penting kini kami sudah mulai bisa menghadapi persoalan itu
244200 pemerintah as dan irak tetap mengejar tentara al mahdi dan al sadr karena kami menolak kesepakatan keamanan itu akibatnya sekarang ada tembok tembok pemisah di kota al sadr seperti di palestina supaya kami tak bisa keluar

244214 elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed fervently that it might not rain and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth bore its fruit
244215 i dont think god is performing those kinds of miracles today the chief reason he did those things in biblical days was to certify revelation as divine to back up what he spoke with evidence of his authority since we now have the bible other miraculous sources of revelation are no longer necessary
244216 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say

244222 the nations employers eliminated 51 000 jobs in july the seventh consecutive contraction in the labor market as the unemployment rate reached a four year high signs that the pressure on business owners and consumers was likely to continue
244223 and in july wage growth continued to stagnate falling far behind the rate of inflation
244224 who make up about 80 percent of the nations payrolls
244225 jobs declined for the seventh month in a row in july down 51 000 for a total of 463 000 jobs lost so far this year according to todays report from the bureau of labor statistics
244226 on average this year payrolls have contracted by 66 000 per month
244227 this persistent and deepening slack in the job market in tandem with accelerated inflation is leading to significant real wage and benefit losses for most workers
244228 in a related release yesterday the bls reported that the employer cost index
244229 the combination of fewer jobs and diminished hours per week is leading total hours in the economy to decline fairly sharply down 0

244232 but the change has produced an institution and profession with internal tensions if not outright contradictions
244233 which of these two traditions the charitable or the more recent are we the custodians of the answer is both we are tested by how creatively we balance and resolve those contending logics and meld them into a concept and code of behavior that honor the imperatives of both traditions this may seem and partly is just another version of the contemporary dilemma how do we remain human in an institutional environment

244243 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
244244 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
244245 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
244246 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
244247 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
244248 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
244249 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
244250 95 of them support me what more do you want
244251 we had to really physically prepare through an extensive workout program as well as gain an understanding of the physiological changes from sea level to increasing altitudes
244252 after every step we had to stop and breathe in between it is difficult to breathe at that altitude
244253 when these students work with pulmonary patients that have shortness of breath they will truly know what that means
244254 when we were in colorado all the effects of altitude were right there in front of us

244270 what the research tells us is that we need a new nonprofit culture this is not an indictment of the sectors leadership we have talented committed people driving nonprofits forward but they are undercut by a culture that sees investment in capacity as a diversion of money from what matters most which is service
244271 changing circumstances will require additions as new challenges arise and deletions where needs have been met new customers must be welcomed as we move beyond the old walls both physically and psychologically tomorrow may be tenuous but the message for leaders of the future is clear managing for mission innovation and diversity will sustain us and those we serve

244298 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
244299 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
244300 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
244301 there are probably still individuals within the isi who are ideologically sympathetic to the taleban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of pakistan
244302 we need to identify these people and weed them out
244303 there is no question of any purge in the isi
244304 the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing it was in the past during the soviet jihad that a few pro taleban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out
244305 the decision was revoked within hours apparently following intervention from the army

244331 bringing in the hired guns to run a nastier campaign tells me hes in a tough spot and will stop at nothing to win
244332 the addition of two former clinton for president staffers is just the first of what we expect to be many extreme makeovers in andrew rices campaign his message was rejected by members of his own party so no doubt the next makeover will be a refining of his personal image new issues and new values
244333 is a veteran of personal attack politics serving on senator john kerrys 2004 presidential campaign and as spokesman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee before joining hillary clintons unsuccessful presidential campaign
244334 the purpose of this book is to examine certain specific aspects of human experience these aspects are chosen because of their universality and because of their significance for tutoring the human spirit emphasis added there are five such areas included in the discussion commitment growth suffering prayer and reconciliation
244335 it humiliates and violates the person and very often the dignity of the human spirit
244336 though suffering is a private encounter and in the last analysis a man must deal with it in solitariness and isolation it is ultimately reassuring if it can be placed in a frame of reference as universal and comprehensive as life itself
244337 openings are made in life by suffering that are not made in any other way
244338 the only thing is to wait it out to affirm with avid recollection and present insistence that the contradictions of life are never final all contradictions are held together in an almighty synthesis that gives them ultimately a meaning and a context
244339 that mankind is protected and sustained by undeserved suffering that swinging out beyond the logic of antecedent and consequence of sowing and reaping there is another power another force supplementing and restoring the ravages wrought in human life by punishment and reward the innocent are always present when the payment falls due their presence in the world is a stabilizing factor a precious ingredient maintaining the delicate balance that prevents humanity from p lunging into the abyss
244340 but what of those whose lives are not girded by such a faith are these others abandoned by god and left to languish without a witness of his love
244341 is part of the life contract that every living being signs at the entrance to reject suffering is to reject life
244342 the ultimate logic of suffering of course lies in the fact of death the particular quality of death is found in what it says about the future death is a denial of the validity of the future this is the logic of all suffering it is what rallies the spirit and girds man to do battle suffering is the gauntlet that death throws down in the arena stripped of all cultural accretions and special limitations of specific historic situations religion says that life and death take place in a larger context which religion calls life life and death are the experience of living things and here life in some sense becomes identical with god death is seen as being an experience within life not happening to life emphasis original
244343 two areas are conspicuously in need of attention these days regarding ways and means areas in which were doing the right thing the wrong way the two areas are our approaches to congregational life and scripture
244344 the congregation is not about us meaning pastors i presume it is about god
244345 too many of us read only for information for know how to better ourselves when we need a break from that we read for entertainment
244346 so what is the way in regard to scripture how do we receive this text heres how by listening and responding and submitting our reading of this text is a personal listening to a personal god we listen to god speak our lives into being we listen to the story that provides a narrative shape and meaning to a life of following jesus in the conditions of the world it is prayerful relational obedient listening
244347 best of all he was known for his distinguished and brilliant profanity and was a prodigiously loud swearer sometimes what you want most of all is someone to do honest verbal justice to life
244348 our intention to plan a sermon emphasis original is commendable and inevitable for sunday is fast approaching yet our task at this early moment in the preparation process should be to set aside our intentionality in favor of the possibility of inadvertent surprise
244349 because art of all kinds has the potential of grasping us rather than being grasped as ideational material
244350 and now he takes those loaves and fishes and says the blessing and divides them just as any jewish father would do at home
244351 more important he doesnt actually say the crowd was fed he knows we will say it to ourselves but in the next paragraph it will be assumed as he asks how now our curiosity is strained we want to know how jesus did it but curiosity goes hungry while the crowd is fed mark wants us to see the people not the loaves the crowd has more than enough to eat and there were twelve baskets of leftovers and dont ask where they got the baskets either once again keck is faced with the same old question about miracle again he doesnt want us to go on a detour he utilizes the storys own imagery in noting that curiosity goes hungry
244352 the point is that our inadequacies if solved by the evocation of the sermon are solved by the power of christs blessing nothing less can be any sermons purpose
244353 this sermon will begin inside the text run into a problem and hence require the telling of the story to be suspended while another text provides a way out of the dilemma once accomplished the sermonic process moves back to the central text for the completion of the message
244354 there comes great relief for many people when a preacher dares to ask what they have always wanted to ask moreover there are many in most congregations who are close to illiterate about the bible who can be helped by this procedure certainly one defense against having to ever read the bible is the presumed attitude that people who have read it are precisely those who do not question it this misplaced respect has contributed to the next generations ignorance at least i have found it so in some congregations i have served after all if you dont read it you wont know what you ought to believe and dont my experience is that sermons that include such questioning are the ones that tend to draw the greatest amount of substantive comments after the service
244355 the sermon must find a way out of the apparent dilemma
244356 there is another perhaps more important purpose for preachers attempting such freely invented stories such recreations will open the mind of the preacher i suggest their use even if the final result is not good enough to be included in the finished sermon before the shock of recognition can occur for listeners it needs to occur for the preacher freely invented stories often promote that shock
244357 most of us are not greatly impacted by an alteration we are impacted by a radically new and different image to do that one needs the power of nouns and verbs
244358 we may think the result of our efforts a bit feeble in comparison but the proper comparison is not with anyone else the proper comparison is between how we do things now and how we might do things find another term for the usual one then find another context for the new term and then find a phrase associated with that other context
244359 when listeners begin to believe the preacher knows them better than they know themselves a kind of communion emerges when craddock said let me tell you a story who would say no
244360 then the whisper put on flesh new testament ethics in an african american context
244361 what has the gospel to do with the oppressed of the land and their struggle for liberation any theologian who fails to place that question at the center of his or her work has ignored the essence of the gospel
244362 that the bible has always been read through the experiences of the people holding it the meaning they draw and the ethics they build are directly related to the lives they lead it is no wonder that for a people in slavery and yearning to be free that the bible would mean and encourage liberation
244363 an identifiable alternative worship community in an environment he believed was hostile to its reconfiguration of the faith of gods people
244364 when we carefully read johns work in the light of its first century context we find his language and symbolism to be the stuff of active counter cultural community resistance
244365 the injustices that presently plagued them were in truth no more
244366 paul apparently did not have the full ethical courage of his galatians 3 28 convictions
244367 because the people who lived the symbolic language also lived the contrary lives of opposition to the political and religious powers of their respective worlds
244368 hoped for and enacted conclusion divine judgment that would transform the human historical landscape was anticipated instead
244369 finally after developing series topics and sermon titles i outline each sermon beginning with the human condition moving to possible scriptures that might speak to this condition and any theological concepts that have bearing on it
244370 the sermon has its roots in the truth of the gospel which indeed has a life of its own
244371 some will reply a theme or topic others will reply a problem or a felt need both kinds of replies are correct but something is missing the first reply concentrates on the substance of the sermon the central message to be preached but if this is the central priority in our sermon preparation we will tend to produce lecture type sermons which are strong in content but weak in establishing contact with our congregation if we follow the advice of the second kind of reply we likely will establish quick rapport with the listeners but be weak in content
244372 i mean quite literally that i take my jumble of notes and divide them into two stacks on my desk the one with problem notes and the other with theme or answer notes then i try to link thoughts from one stack of ideas with the other until a relational gestalt happens
244373 it is not enough to probe the question of what the text is saying it is equally important to discover why it is saying what it says the question of why is most often the context for the transition into homiletical form every explicit theme presumes an implicit problem every explicit problem presumes an implicit theme when this does not hold there is no sermon
244374 tell them what you are going to tell them tell them and then tell them what you told them
244375 what is missing is depth a probing into the causative ingredients responsible for the situation
244376 this sudden reversal in preaching comes as the clue to resolution reverses the train of diagnostic thought the resultant shock does not come in the form of humor but in the form of release by means of sudden illumination of the homiletical puzzle
244377 what is being alleged here is not that paul jesus and the writer of the abraham story necessarily intended to utilize the principle of reversal obviously it is that there seems to be a common thread of narrative plot procedure which in fact constitutes what can be labeled the principle of reversal moreover the principle of reversal which occasions the homiletical
244378 the peculiar talent of the puzzlemaker a rather sadistic one at that is the talent of
244379 the reason that flashes of insight come when one is not looking is that our cognitive ruts lose their tenacious hold upon us when our mind is occupied with other things or begins to drift as we go to sleep hence the unthinkable thought generally inverted from common sense has a chance to break through
244380 scientific learning does not advance incrementally by the steady accumulation of data but by the emergence of new interpretive paradigms that drastically rearrange data
244381 so too the expertise of the homilist may produce blinders preventing resolution of an issue in many cases crucial diagnostic resolution will come only by reversing the particular assumption
244382 the gospel as continuous with human experience after human experience has been turned upside down
244383 i worked to come to terms with this remarkable woman who survived the complexities of public life and the realities of racial politics turning away from the both with surprising contentment and of course as a white woman i had to come to terms with her blackness with what it meant to her and to me
244384 barbara jordan also made time during her second year at boston university law school to attend sunday services at marsh chapel the religious center of boston university she was drawn to its preacher howard thurman who served as dean of the chapel and as a professor in the boston university school of theology she heard in thurmans sermons a way to change how she thought about and experienced religion a way to free herself from ben jordans harsh interpretation of the scriptures and his narrow path to living a christian life
244385 jordan was so taken with thurmans sermons that she literally preached them to herself
244386 for niebuhr both political and moral realists understood the use of power and the moral realist was willing to use political power to achieve some human good jordan had become a niebuhr style moral realist with an understanding that if she wanted to promote human good then she had to have enough power to operate effectively
244387 before watergate all she wanted was to be a politician not a statesman or a moral leader or a guardian of government ethics and certainly not a civil rights leader after watergate jordan added one more label to describe herself patriot she considered the u s constitution her personal charter for freedom
244388 there is no reason why a country as large and powerful as we are should not occupy the highest moral position possible in relation to other countries the core of morality is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you i believe each individual should have a principled core of his or her being that cannot get negotiated out that has served me well
244389 for people of faith transformation doesnt happen it is a gift from god
244390 can preaching help people make the connection between gods grace and the shaping of new communities
244391 for those who have known the tragic wounds of ostracism and oppression gods word of inclusion and blessing is the bottom line of preaching
244392 those who have felt the sting of exclusion need to hear gods welcome in ways that honor and respect their particularities
244393 reach out not only to the prodigal but also to the older brother
244394 now isnt this better than sitting at a table a girl hasnt got but two sides to her at the table
244395 like his friend harry emerson fosdick he was about as liberal theologically and religiously as you could get nevertheless he spent an hour each day on his knees at prayer another hour reading the bible and each morning we had family prayers for twenty minutes
244396 i exemplifies in a way a modern version of augustines faith finding its perfection in love or of luthers faith is the doer love is the deed
244397 the question of what any tradition means is part of that tradition itself and as long as the tradition lives the question remains in dispute congregations even without knowing it are immersed in this argument they do not simply inherit tradition they contribute to it a living congregation does not leave a living tradition unaffected
244398 in the black tradition the altar prayer or pastoral prayer is a significant therapeutic moment

244414 a strong pattern of growth even during times of war and crisis
244415 the institution built itself from the ground up stage by stage
244416 i could envision it as eventually blending in and being grown over a bit when other sculptures are erected
244417 i suppose i knew as much about spike milligan as anybody else really
244418 i was more influenced by monty python spike was slightly out of my time as a kid although i do have early memories of listening to the goons on the advertisement radio i have more memories of his tv show and although i didnt get into all of it i did like his weird sketches
244419 he was obviously what today would be considered bipolar but that condition hadnt been diagnosed then
244420 the play charts how despite his lows there was this amazing relationship and how norma farnes actually dealt with this man when nobody else could
244421 one minute he would be up really high the next he would completely shut down and lock himself in his office hed stay there for three or four days at a time sometimes weeks and not come out then when he did he behave as if nothing had happened
244422 there is an undercurrent of realism there that makes me go i wonder why they cast me
244423 there is no doubt that i can relate to where he is at however
244424 i was at dinner with bill kenwright and some friends mucking about doing my stanley unwin act and improvising a story about all the people around the table
244425 someone said to bill theres a spike i didnt know what he was talking about but bill said ive got a script have a look at it
244426 i did my first reaction was its a lot of words and you are playing somebody that people know its not a role you can characterise and its a real story i thought well you said you wanted to be an actor go for it
244427 its a very funny play very sad tragic in places mid way through i break the fourth wall to do his stand up so you have the mix of the two but there are some points when you look at the words and think why did norma put up with him he really would go too far with her sometimes
244428 that helped spike had first choice of office its a big tall building norma is on the ground floor on the left eric is at the front but spike chose a small room at the back with a window through which he could feed the birds there was also a bed in there when he locked himself away
244429 jill is brilliant as norma and she has given me a good run for my money
244430 she comes at me all the time and when i am up there i firmly believe that i am in that office
244431 at first i thought should i work on his voice but what is his voice spike had so many voices then i thought if i do an impression of him it is never going to be bang on and i wont be able to keep it up for any length of time also you cant act the emotion when you are focusing on capturing the voice
244432 its quite draining at times especially when he starts to beat himself up because milligan was harder on himself than anyone else
244433 im so proud of it weve adapted it slightly for edinburgh but after windsor i believe i now have a better understanding of spike and even his body language he doesnt move his arms around a lot

244448 close attention to work quality and portfolio risk management continues to be crucial as ifc invests heavily in newer and riskier markets especially in conditions of a downturn in global economic growth this holds especially true for africa a region where ifc has to revamp efforts to ensure that the overall results and environmental and social shortcomings of projects are addressed
244449 world bank and imf do they really want better aid
244450 the large increases in biofuels production in the u s and eu were supported by subsidies mandates and tariffs on imports
244451 without these policies biofuels production would have been lower and food commodity price increases would have been smaller
244452 such a simplistic approach fails to accurately and honestly account for the myriad of factors driving food costs higher
244453 i encourage the author and the world bank to revisit the issue without bias taking into account the increasingly significant role biofuels are playing in reducing global oil demand
244454 before the operation we had to describe to him that he would have to deal with the fact hed have somebody elses hands

244460 the tanzanian water privatisation project was a scandal right from the beginning
244461 its absolutely right that this court has found that tanzania owes biwater nothing but shocking that biwater saw fit to drag the government of such a poor country through the courts in the first place
244462 our city water staffing was totally with non biwater staff with a weak leader no clear experience or qualified business plan
244463 no professionally installed accounting and corporate governance and an overall corporate failure all the way to dorking biwaters headquarters
244464 sent an extremely negative message to the international investment community
244465 since city water is for all practical purposes defunct has no functioning board and no assets the action was completely pointless
244466 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels

244470 i cannot answer the question because it was not raised in our dialogue

244477 both windows vista and windows live onecare offer some new innovations to help improve pc performance by making it easier to turn off and remove applications that people dont use regularly
244478 windows vista customers can turn off programs that launch as part of the boot sequence using windows defender which most people think of as spyware protection but it also
244479 windows live onecare similarly enables customers to turn off programs with its start time optimizer service
244480 from what weve seen with onecare alone 80 of customers opt to remove unwanted and unused files when presented with the option and typically remove about 2 applications per start time optimizer session though that can vary over time and computer usage

244491 the increase in feed and fuel costs have dramatically affected the catfish farmers ability to cover his expenses and make a living
244492 farmers put their pencils to work and determined they might not be able to come out ahead
244493 mississippi catfish acreage which peaked in 2001 at 113 000 acres decreased from 92 500 acres over the last half of 2007 to 80 400 acres by the end of july
244494 there were 360 catfish operations as of july 1 2007 and now there are 330 operations in mississippi
244495 most people havent stocked their ponds as high as before and arent feeding the maximum feeding regime each day that we typically do
244496 were not looking at a maximum production scenario this year
244497 it looks like inventory is being cleared as a number of operations are going out of business
244498 those operations that are integrated and grow their own fingerlings and have their own processing plants and are major stockholders in the feed mills are the ones that will have the strongest chance for survival
244499 it is dire for many people and there are a number of producers getting out
244500 the price of fish at the farm gate is going to have to rise to 90 cents to 1 a pound very soon to keep people in business
244501 we have an excellent product and a loyal customer base that wont buy anything but u s pond raised catfish but we likely will need to get the pond and processor inventory below processor and wholesale demand levels
244502 enough growers will have to exit before prices and costs can match and we can survive
244503 at this time there is no evidence that the theft has resulted in any unauthorized disclosure fraudulent credit card applications or other identity theft crimes

244536 right now the visible top line growth outlook in wireless is relatively modest with declining sub gains and so much pressure on voice revenue countering the surge in data
244537 but we think the open endedness of wireless data options especially related to location sensitive and personalized mobile commerce and advertising opportunities could give wireless a second wind in the not too distant future
244538 its not so much convincing people who have walked away from us
244539 its engaging people who dont think of ford as a car brand
244540 given where we were and where we needed to get to i felt someone from outside would break some molds
244541 ford has to change a lot for a maverick approach like farleys to take hold
244542 saving ford has to appeal to ones ego rather than playing it relatively safe at toyota
244543 but helping toyota rack up another 12 billion in profits isnt much of a legacy

244562 what is what it is youre trying to hide shes the one in charge let me speak shes the one in charge of dealing with this problem we wanted to hear from her and despite a subpoena from a committee of congress youve been instructed by the secretary undersecretary or deputy secretary in charge of legislative affairs not to allow her to come i dont know who you think elected you to defy the congress of the united states were an independent branch of government this is an unacceptable absolutely unacceptable position for the department to take and uh we are not going to let it stand
244563 well let me tell you something mr dominguez we decide who we want to have for witnesses at this hearing we decide who uh the people that are going to give us factual testimony the ones that we want to hear from when we are investigating or having a hearing so for now mr dominguez youre dismissed
244564 that nothing will be done fear of ostracism harassment or ridicule and concern that peers would gossip
244565 we are concerned that it does not have all the tools and personnel it needs to go forward and were increasingly concerned that it is becoming politicized
244566 years of inaction at the dod continue to speak volumes about senior leaderships commitment to our servicemembers and civil servants
244567 when it comes to sexual assault in the military the dod has absolutely no credibility
244568 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier
244569 i can assure you the army treats this very very seriously
244570 civilians are not afforded the same protections as active duty military personnel after suffering an assault
244571 if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
244572 we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
244573 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
244574 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
244575 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
244576 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
244577 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
244578 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
244579 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
244580 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
244581 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
244582 this isnt the first major ship acquisition program that has faced problems
244583 every day we are hoping the police will tell us something
244584 come a certain point it just stopped without tips theres nothing else we can do its stagnant
244585 as complex and complicated as this case is it can be frustrating for investigators and from a human standpoint its frustrating to detectives
244586 but at the same time we are continuing to look at all leads
244587 jane was an extraordinary woman who had succeeded despite the odds against her
244588 its upsetting that no ones been arrested and its frightening that something like this could happen so close to home to people that you know
244589 and maybe i read more into that than there is because of what happened

244800 when budgets are tight and states are looking to increase revenue we have seen unclaimed property enforcement step up
244801 what weve found is that oftentimes many companies who feel that theyve been filing reports for years are not in compliance and that tends to be a mess
244802 the reality is that all holders are likely to have some unreported unclaimed property liability and the larger you are the more complex you are the more dispersement accounts the more merger and acquisition activities that you have the greater the risk that you have so if you are a very large company and have somewhat of a complex organization structure the likelihood that you are going to have unclaimed property issues is high
244803 the government is proposing that the intelligence court should consider the constitutionality of the new surveillance law in proceedings that will be entirely secret if the governments request is granted the court wont hear arguments from anyone except the government and those arguments will be presented to the court in secret briefs at the end of the process the court will issue a ruling that is also secret the process the government is proposing is completely unacceptable especially because the new surveillance law departs so significantly from the standards that have applied to government surveillance for the last 30 years any proceedings relating to the new laws constitutionality should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible

244831 of course in ashley bayes john martin daryl mcmahon and iyseden christie there is some faces we recognise i worked with all of them in some capacity during my time at the club so there is a strong connection there they will probably be out to prove a point against us although i would like to get one over them as well

244840 esta situaci n es lamentable y de responsabilidad del gobierno ya que no han sido capaces de generar un clima ptimo para que el mercado del trabajo satisfaga las necesidades de los chilenos la incapacidad de desarrollar pol ticas en pro del empleo ha hecho que esta rea aumente en un 27 7 en el ltimo a o

244848 una maggiore compostezza assolutamente indispensabile e lintroduzione del voto sulla condotta gi un segnale in questo senso
244849 c attesa per fermare questi fenomeni assolutamente negativi che si stanno verificando nelle nostre scuole
244850 con comportamenti riconducibili ha detto sempre berlusconi a ipotesi di reato come violenza privata minaccia percosse ingiurie reati di natura sessuale incendio o allagamento
244851 il voto di condotta ai fini della bocciatura stato abolito con listituzione dello statuto dei diritti degli studenti una grande conquista del movimento studentesco e della democrazia nelle scuole
244852 nessuna infrazione disciplinare connessa al comportamento pu influire sulla valutazione del profitto
244853 tornare ai vecchi decreti regi istituiti sotto la disciplina fascista ci sembra un ritorno al passato sottolinea iovino che gi il ministro moratti aveva provato a mettere in atto senza successo
244854 ritiene sia necessario tutelare gli studenti meritevoli anche nel comportamento per questo sosteniamo la reintroduzione sulla valutazione della condotta
244855 pu essere positivo che il comportamento concorra alla valutazione complessiva dello studente
244856 in questi due giorni di dibattito alla camera sui tagli contenuti nel dl 112 che sono pari a 8 miliardi di euro non si fatto vedere e non ha fatto sentire la sua voce anche questo ha concluso il senatore pd vuol dire rispettare le regole
244857 il ritorno del voto in condotta ha detto lesponente dellidv pu essere infatti un deterrente per contrastare gli episodi sempre pi frequenti di teppismo e bullismo negli istituti ma la linea del rigore intrapresa dal ministro gelmini purtroppo non si accompagna al rinnovamento della scuola italiana che ha bisogno di risorse e investimenti non di tagli indiscriminati
244858 uno strumento che consente una valutazione pi ampia della crescita e della maturazione dei ragazzi inconcepibile avere nella nostra scuola ragazzi magari capaci bravi ma fuori dalle regole educative questi sono i passi giusti per restituire alla scuola lautorit che merita attraverso lordine la legalit e il rigore

244860 they approach the resident telling them they have some material left over from another job and will sell it to them at a bargain price
244861 the quality of the work performed is poor and the resident is usually overcharged
244862 the performance is the first ballet performance where i choreographed all of the pieces
244863 for all of the performers except for four it is the first time they have performed for anyone
244864 this is a chance for the people who havent performed to get to on a smaller venue
244865 its just a chance to get to perform with not a lot of the pressure of a huge audience
244866 its a chance to show off their skills for friends and family its a lot of fun with the costumes and atmosphere
244867 normally with these embezzlement cases they are someone who the employer has put a lot of trust in and usually is someone the employer has known before coming to work for them
244868 many times when large amounts of money are embezzled it is because a person is given greater authority
244869 you should always be wary of an employee who isolates themselves
244870 theyre generally pretty reliable when it comes to being at work but theyre also pretty possessive
244871 theyre here for a week of training before school starts and we wanted to do a community service project
244872 im just glad i can be out here and help people
244873 service learning across the county is becoming much more prevalent
244874 the majority are not from butler county but they are still learning to give back to the community
244875 while our elementary school students are doing very well we recognize there are problems in our high schools that we want to address
244876 we had some resistance from members who thought it was another giveaway to illegal immigrants
244877 the truth is this is a great opportunity for kids to learn another language at an age appropriate time i hope this court order gives us some impetus to try out new approaches like this
244878 we are disappointed that the judge reversed his original order of a year ago
244879 we are continuing to study this latest ruling but we do anticipate asking the attorney general to appeal
244880 we know that these programs have been effective for thousands of students
244881 i dont feel very comfortable about our esl programs statewide absolutely not
244882 thats not as good a program as the bilingual program it leads me to believe theres a lot of work to be done to deliver a different program i have no idea what thats going to look like
244883 the decision reinforces the need and urgency for us to do something as a state
244884 we need to develop new programs and new approaches in meeting the needs of these children my hope is that the state will see this as an opportunity to improve the quality of the programs and not see it as a threat
244885 i dont know how on earth the state can say the esl program is successful in any manner
244886 theyre not being told to develop a whole new program it just needs to be a program with some teeth in it
244887 will require a commitment not only from the state but also from school districts and principals many of our schools have been neglecting the needs of these students by holding low expectations for them and providing poor resources for their education
244888 i wanted to do something more than just attend classes in germany
244889 i was afraid i wouldnt get along with my host family
244890 in a world of fugitives the person whos headed in the right direction will appear to be running away

244892 it was americas misguided leadership that was the agent of those losses

244909 in analyzing whether comcast violated federal policy when it blocked access to certain applications we conduct a fact specific inquiry into whether the management practice they used was reasonable
244910 based on many reasons including the arbitrary nature of the blocking the lack of relation to times of congestion or size of files and the manner in which they hid their conduct from their subscribers we conclude it was not

244914 were still on track for our goal of being in every neighborhood
244915 we started free the net last year before we moved
244916 its helpful to be close to the network but it was also more of a personal move for a lot of employees half the company had been living here and the other half wanted to
244917 in the u s businesses are using the free the net model on a much smaller scale
244918 our clients are also often small towns that want to offer free wi fi downtown in a business district or across the whole town our solution is cost effective you can get 20 devices for 3 000 and light up the whole place and deploy it all at once in a week
244919 youll bump into people on the street and theyll recognize your tee shirt we are continuing to grow its one of the largest networks thats been out there in the world
244920 a few dozen people volunteer to host equipment every week
244921 its word of mouth i think someone will do a successful deployment and then tell their relatives or friends we entered ecuador and new zealand and then there were networks all over those countries six months later we do especially well where theres not a wired infrastructure in place
244922 theres a misconception about what meraki is and isnt and weve been compared to fon but were really more about infrastructure
244923 instead of individual consumers like fon for us its towns
244924 like cape horn they are now offering wi fi across cape horn at the southern tip of chile and iceland with our equipment
244925 were seeing these mini munis that keep coming to us in terms of cost for a business district to spend 5 not a lot of money we had a bunch of but thats not where our customer base is at all its apartment buildings those kinds of places its apartment complex owners who were trying to decided between repainting the rec room or adding wi fi or towns that decided to put in wi fi instead of one more street lamp
244926 with free the net since its all our products we get to be our own customer
244927 we pay for the gear and the broadband and rely on the volunteers to offer the aps
244928 we see hundreds of users at once and the devices identify themselves so we know what our users are relying on to access the network
244929 were seeing local business owners who want to offer free wi fi in their venue like cafes and restaurants home users who didnt have a broadband connection already there are a lot of higher end people in san francisco who have broadband networks already at home but they use ours as a secondary source when theyre out and about on any given day about 20 of our users are iphone users those people use it because its faster than edge or a 3g network wi fi is a lot better user experience
244930 if you have a house on a hill you just put an ap on the roof and have links that can go for a mile or two as we crawl up twin peaks to sutro tower for instance or into the haight and the mission we face the unique geography of san francisco trees hills sometimes someone will have a taller building in the way but our customers around the world are seeing those same problems if you put out a bunch of aps you can hedge your bets it doesnt have to be the tallest building

244959 david there was some email correspondence between myself and officers last week concerning the broken bollard on duke street which controls access to the skinnergate pedestrian area this is due to be mended within the next couple of weeks however since last week i have been approached by several retailers and cafe owners from the area to ask if a temporary barrier could be installed as the schools break up and kids are in town and as the weather improves and tables and chairs are being put outside arcadia for example there is genuine concern that there may be an accident on skinnergate while so many drivers flout the law and drive through during the day pedestrians and cars do not mix well and kids running around outdoor tables and chairs mix even less well with cars see http cllrmikebarker blogspot com 2008 07 protests grow html for some examples from a ten minute stroll i had down skinnergate this afternoon

244975 backdating isnt just a way for insiders to distort how much theyre really paying themselves and others in the company it also involves issuing stock at cheaper prices than what would be paid if the rules had been followed
244976 for that reason it threatens a companys shareholders in a very direct way
244977 i take full responsibility for the fact that the administration of our stock option program did not live up to the high standards we follow in other aspects of our business
244978 we believe that the steps we have taken should put this issue behind us both from a financial statement and a controls standpoint

244986 manufacturers indicate no change in overall business activity when comparing july to june

245036 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
245037 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
245038 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
245039 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
245040 now that we have a candidate it has definitely helped in our efforts
245041 before you had a lot of people on the sidelines saying let me see who the nominee is and then well talk
245042 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
245043 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
245044 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
245045 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
245046 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign
245047 thats not to say that we have not received help from a lot of the people in the obama campaign
245048 were still a little bit short but im not worried about it
245049 the obama campaign is on the ground and theyre helping out and you know well have all the money that we need to pay everybody on time according to their contracts
245050 it is a process to restore impaired waters thats why were all here
245051 i have not seen a statistical trend that is increasing or decreasing

245060 im feeling very good here very well here and at the moment my heart is with arsenal
245061 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
245062 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
245063 when we started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
245064 i think the consultation process was fatally flawed partly in relation to the inappropriately short consultation period of just six weeks
245065 furthermore as another example of the flawed consultation process in respect of one post office nethergate in dundee i and others objecting to the closure including the city councils own objection gave post office limited clear specific evidence about customer growth in the future
245066 information was also received on several new developments being planned in the area
245067 there is absolutely no explanation as to how post office limited dealt with this evidence and why it dismissed it in attempting to justify the closure in its decision booklet post office limited confines its comments to the accessibility issues of the nearest alternative post offices it appears scant if any regard has been taken to the evidence presented to it calling into question the appropriateness of the consultation process
245068 at this stage it is difficult to say whether or not a legal challenge to post office limited would be viable or succeed but it is important to seek clear legal advice on this matter i am aware from past cases that several local authorities have successfully worked together on other matters of concern to their citizens and what is abundantly clear from the post office limited decision earlier this week is that people right across the north east tayside and fife are extremely concerned about the large number of post office closures right across the whole region

245073 before the park i was just skating in the streets
245074 part of the reason for building a skate park is we know there are skaters in town and parents who are concerned theres no local safe place to skate
245075 it gives us a benchmark it gives us a chance to talk to other parents who have kids the same age
245076 gay couples cant have biological kids together so if homosexuality is genetic why hasnt it died out

245079 the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john although it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized
245080 after this jesus and his disciples went into the judean countryside and he spent some time there with them and baptized
245081 i baptize you with water he jesus will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire
245082 now when jesus learned that the pharisees had heard jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than john he left judea and started back to galilee
245083 it was not jesus himself but his disciples who baptized
245084 i dont know the last time ive seen so disgraceful a display from a talented actor it used to be that actors playing the mentally retarded suffered from a discretion that was its own kind of bad taste they tended to downplay mannerisms and distortions of speech and the unintentional message was that retarded people are unpleasant to watch penn delves into mannerisms and vocal distortions with an appalling eagerness
245085 sean penn is worth his weight in gold in the little gem of a film the plot and acting are perfect dare you not to shed a tear
245086 he went from that place to galilee for jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country

245090 drink from his mouth john compares jesus words with living water running water which was believed to have special vivifying properties
245091 living water is body we must clothe the man who is alive

245095 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point

245101 i know its getting pirated to hell and back it was up on torrents literally the day it shipped
245102 most reviewers write it off as console dreck because its not an rts an fps or an mmo
245103 indeed its content that doesnt often show up on the pc and i think thats part of the reason we wanted to put it there we think there is an audience for action games on the pc that arent fpses even if they are sometimes best played with a gamepad rather than a kb and a mouse
245104 to my knowledge mass effect still isnt fully cracked tripwires still result in certain bugs in the pirated versions pirates havent found them all yet and our data collected on bioshock is pretty damn solid too from certain audit services and their integration wasnt as deep as mass effects
245105 i think we have a terrific asset i think we have terrific people
245106 were excited to start our schedule we start against uc davis on august 30 we go to nebraska after that and then play san diego state before we go to stanford and then we start our conference

245108 the guy that is our quarterback at this point is myles eden
245109 beyond that we have to find out who the second guy is kyle reed who came from jeffs tedford fine program at cal broke his foot in our off season training and practiced for about a week and a half it was a stress fracture he thought he could go but he couldnt we need to find out more about kyle and then we have two other candidates senior sean flynn and redshirt sophomore jordan lasecla we need to continue to find out more about as well

245116 the city attorneys office engaged in a practice that has a disparate impact on attorneys of color seeking promotion to the attorney ii position
245117 respondent actively consults with the city attorneys office and essentially plans and designs the interview process for attorney ii applicants respondent assisted the employer office of the city attorney in the complained discriminatory practice
245118 the idea is that the city attorneys office probablycouldnt have done it itself hr collaborated with the city attorney
245119 in any government agency human resources has to be separate to implement policies and procedures it has a watchdog function
245120 it set up the promotional system candidates for ranking hiring and firing
245121 nearly every attorney i or attorney ii expressed dismay with the promotional process and the changes in the office atmosphere
245122 is necessary to finding and promoting the best candidate and that it provides those involved in the hiring process the best information on which to judge the candidates
245123 seriously lacking as a justification for a practice that results in a demonstrable disparate impact on a group of employees
245124 no one whos applied for the midlevel attorney position has been denied for as long as ive been here
245125 trial and negotiation skills hard work and preparedness are more important i have a hard time believing that any test can capture that exclusively
245126 it should have a greater understanding of fair process than other places do sometimes organizations that are less learned arent as likely to self correct but this is a government agency and we hold it to a higher standard
245127 its arbitrary and they couldve gotten the outcome a different way
245128 it has been three years since i worked around the clock pleading with other myspace intermix shareholders to vote against the sale of myspace to news corp in 2005
245129 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value

245181 first it says that our years of work pioneering the green household and personal care products category have paid off in the form of a leadership position thats important to shoppers
245182 but whats most positive about this new research is that it shows that young people are in tune with values of sustainability that those issues matter to the people who are the consumers of the future its one thing for our company to rate highly in a study conducted among affluent mothers or hard core environmental activists but something else entirely to come out on top with people who are just starting out in life and havent yet acquired the wealth or knowledge thats so prevalent in our traditional consumers its wonderful that our message has penetrated so deeply and so broadly and that corporate consciousness is no longer seen as a fringe concern
245183 at the apsa i really enjoyed working with terry arnold of avw which is now part of freeman some of our attendees were less experienced with using audiovisual equipment but terry and his team knew our audience so well that they were prepared to assist in any way they could sometimes our room agendas changed with only a few weeks notice before the conference and terrys team was nothing but helpful and accommodating we also worked with jennifer manigross at freeman who in addition to producing anything and everything we could imagine even remembered little things like my supervisors birthday

245206 we filed this complaint because the purpose of campaign finance laws are to protect the publics right to know which groups are running ads that could affect the outcome of elections in north carolina without more information about where this group comes from and its donor base voters are justified in assuming the worst about the influence of shady third party special interest groups who insert themselves into the governors race just last week bev perdue was decrying the influence of third party groups and this week she is directly benefitting from it if bev perdue really believes in what she says she will condemn this illegal ad and tell the alliance for north carolina to take it down

245217 the pigs are hung upside down while fully conscious and then have their throats slit
245218 even traditional open air farmers markets have cas approved pork
245219 this is impossible because cas stipulates that the pork must be properly refrigerated at these stands the pork is not refrigerated and usually delivered before the vendors arrive leading to contamination by rats and unsanitary conditions

245231 chinas official news agencies no longer refer to taiwan as zhongguo taibei or taipei china this would have been hard to achieve if it were not for the governments efforts on cross strait relations over the last two months
245232 we need not to request we need not to beg it is our right to join the procession under the
245233 we have felt wronged for the treatment we have received in other olympic games for years and we should let the international community know the injustice and wrong we have taken along the way
245234 one web page for every book ever published its a lofty but achievable goal
245235 which will allow the company to seed adoption and to capture maximum market share now while the company still has buzz and a perceived differentiation relative to its competitors
245236 we believe the freeze on foreign military sales to taiwan violates the spirit of the taiwan relations act we request a briefing on the status of these sales from all appropriate agencies and urge the administration to expeditiously execute consideration of these requests
245237 the military and strategic imperatives for taiwan are real and urgent and if we fail to show the necessary resolve it would mean missing a significant opportunity to improve cross strait peace and security a vital us interest
245238 any arms freeze is a clear violation of the law the taiwan relations act and needs to be lifted immediately
245239 its very important for the president to be very consistent
245240 i would say that theres been a its just been interesting to watch i would say that theres been a its just been interesting to watch and interesting to participate with people i mean the taiwan issue was a very touchy issue for a while causing me to say in the oval office that which is now well chronicled that the united states does not support a unilateral declaration of independence because i wanted to make sure that our message was clear but also that the relationship was in a way not our relationship but others relationship with china was in a way that it could evolve peacefully and constructively
245241 my only point to you is is that or the taiwan chinese relationship and that issue its a very sensitive issue for the chinese government and people who study this very closely will see that the issue is in a better place and i made it abundantly clear that there was some red lines for the united states on this issue that there would be no unilateral declaration of independence that our policy was still the same its very important for the president to be very consistent
245242 the lawmakers had accused me of siding with the dpp on such issues as holding referendums together with elections the name change for the chiang kai shek memorial hall and the referendum on joining the un using the name taiwan
245243 superiors are the brains and civil servants are their hands and feet
245244 my superior has the right to transfer me and i totally respect that but for the past 28 years i had worked for the country for the government and not for any party
245245 while we are seeking advancement in communication technology we also need to pay attention to issues concerning cultural diversity and take care of the economically disadvantaged
245246 with its goals to achieve a healthy mind and body a healthy community and a healthy earth lohas is the answer to many of the problems facing modern society
245247 on your days off take a trip to the countryside travel slowly interact with locals and learn something new immerse yourself in the environment so that your body and mind get fully rested
245248 cut the carbon emissions in your life ride bicycles drive hybrid cars ride with your friends or neighbors to work
245249 businesses should share some of the responsibility in creating a lohas society
245250 rather than waiting for the government to do it the power of the community was more reliable
245251 one of the first problems our community ran into was garbage collection
245252 that meant we had to put out the garbage the night before
245253 in order to raise the funds for the garbage service we designed our own jiyugaoka garbage bags and sold them via vending machines in the community
245254 since jiyugaoka is far from the metropolitan center we decided to have a shuttle bus running to the nearest train station and have the bus run on recycled food oil to reduce pollution
245255 the transportation authority said that we had to have a registered company to run the shuttle service and that the bus could not run on recycled food oil
245256 its quite ironic that the ministry of the environment have presented awards to jiyugaoka for our eco friendly bus while the ministry of land infrastructure and transport still does not allow it
245257 actually this is not a new discovery as reports on the issue appeared more than 70 years ago
245258 our research results are only reconfirming an old theory and provide a clearer direction for treatment
245259 they should have agreed a week ago to let us anonymize it we are willing to discuss the disclosure of viewing activity of all the relevant parties but the simple issue of protecting user information should be resolved now our users privacy should not be held hostage to advance the plaintiffs additional litigation interests
245260 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations

245263 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
245264 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
245265 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
245266 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
245267 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
245268 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
245269 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
245270 i make the case to people that by going to the games and respecting the people it gives me credibility with the government so that we can deal with common opportunities and common problems
245271 i am going to china this time as the us president who happens to be a sports fan the nation quoted him as saying
245272 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
245273 our relations with your country thailand south korea with japan and china have never been stronger and it took a lot of work to get bilateral relations as strong as they are
245274 we leave it to the people of permatang pauh to decide
245275 i think we have to be realistic its going to be a tough constituency but we have to do our best
245276 the authorities will enforce the law if there is a case against him
245277 no the government is not threatened we have enough majority
245278 in the spirit of trying to quickly resolve the plight of our people we have put faith in the only solution where we dont have guns to fight the only solution that will see a settlement arrived at in the best interests of the people
245279 every conflict at some stage has to end up at the negotiating table and it is our assessment that the moment for negotiations is now
245280 whatever arrangements are made about positions and allocations it has to consider the will of the people
245281 in any negotiations there are bound to be obstacles on the road to finding a common ground
245282 what we as leaders should do to resolve that crisis
245283 what did i feel in shaking hands with mugabe it was quite an experience
245284 when you meet for the first time after 10 years there is always a tendency of feeling this one has got horns this one has spears and all that but im sure that you cant have one and a half hours of dinner shouting at each other
245285 he found out what kind of man i am i found out what kind of a man he is
245286 and what is the kind of a man is he
245287 it is about dealing with land hunger it is about dealing with an economic asset

245291 i wont allow the commission to take my dogs from me
245292 no position has been taken by the security council on the question of whether to take any action in the light of the moreno ocampo proposal to indict president beshir
245293 the united states abstained in the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president beshir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
245294 i want to give high marks to the british delegation

245306 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
245307 we know the strategy because theyve already shown their cards ultimately i think the american people recognize that old stuff hasnt moved us forward that old stuff just divides us
245308 527s pop up pretty quickly and have enormous influence and weve seen them
245309 i dont think that i am off the wall here to see that a lot of outside groups that are potentially going to be going after us hard
245310 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
245311 you dont go to such lengths as to threaten a minister if you dont feel in danger
245312 you think were kidding put your hand in the fire and see youre digging your own tomb you cant say we didnt warn you

245319 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
245320 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future

245324 one of the reasons for women to kill like this is a desire for vengeance
245325 often they have lost parents brothers or children in the fighting
245326 some want vengeance for the fact their families have disappeared
245327 and it is easy for them to target those people they believe are responsible

245336 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
245337 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
245338 ships aircraft and industrial equipment burn huge quantities of fossil fuel and cause massive greenhouse gas pollution yet president george w bush stalls with one bureaucratic dodge after another
245339 because bushs environmental protection agency continues to wantonly ignore its duty to regulate pollution california is forced to seek judicial action
245340 we know climate change is a huge problem but theres a missing ingredient of urgency

245353 nations are lining up to claim vast tracts of the seabed for oil gas and mineral deposits but international conflict and ecological disasters could be the result

245358 partnership and co operation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
245359 we shouldnt have to hire someone on the side so that our children learn
245360 i dont believe to begin with that were in such bad shape
245361 sometimes its him who gives me international news that i havent had time to read
245362 and i said yes congratulate him because he has a very intelligent brother who learned everything from him
245363 even without wings we can fly our spirits lifted high lighting up the bright red sky we are ready our hearts together brings us glory
245364 he only lost two points on the last set thats terrible for the tennis right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
245365 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
245366 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
245367 i guess ill analyze and assess my game after the us open
245368 for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
245369 it was very frustrating because i didnt know how it was going to pull up i was in pain through the whole match
245370 the pain wasnt so sharp but i couldnt hold my racket on my forehand i tried to fight as much as i could i really wanted to win this match but obviously shes a very good player she figured it out
245371 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
245372 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
245373 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
245374 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
245375 we are in a good position to control the match tomorrow
245376 we come here off the back of two rather difficult races and our target here has to be to extract the full potential of our package and then try to secure the best possible result
245377 fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
245378 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
245379 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race

245388 i call what is happening now a provocation staged deliberately to knock out the potential medalists right before the olympics
245389 all of us had the best chances to win medals in beijing i stress once again that i reject the accusations brought against me by the iaaf athletics world governing body
245390 i also ask my fans to forgive me for being charged with what i am actually not guilty of
245391 the time was carefully chosen we practically could do nothing neither file an appeal nor look into the case we are simply put aside and our hands are tied
245392 five of our golds have already been flushed down the drain
245393 the iaaf could do nothing better ahead of the games in beijing
245394 we have yet to realize the scale of the catastrophe
245395 it appears all of the female athletes are merely hostages in somebody elses very big game
245396 a less important question but a more pertinent one is why is the issue of last years tests emerging just a week ahead of the games couldnt this question have been discussed with us in may june or march
245397 it is a concentrated way to eat ice its going to act as a heat sink and make the athletes body much cooler
245398 a glycerol component is going to act as a sponge for water so rather than weeing out all that sports drink as youd normally do if you over drink the athlete is able to keep it in his or her body
245399 the science shows that drinking a slushie helps keep you cool and its easier than vests and towels and that sort of thing
245400 we have to take every opportunity because the competition is so close
245401 you put your tongue on the top of your mouth
245402 weve got all angles covered hopefully when it is all over well load up the slushie machine with margaritas and celebrate all the gold medals
245403 in the light of this positive test the italian national olympic committee has excluded the athlete from the olympic team
245404 were right back in it weve just got to go hard again in the morning
245405 with the amount of movement there still is off the wicket it makes life tough for the batsmen i think there is going to movement throughout the game
245406 if we can get a hundred ahead hopefully our bowlers can get the ball in the right areas like fred flintoff did
245407 the club has sought clarification from the football association as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
245408 joey will be requesting a personal hearing in relation to the charge and the club will be making no further comment on the matter at this time
245409 when you lose a couple it puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
245410 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations
245411 they are excited they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are ready to climb
245412 as to whether they are going to be good enough we cant do anymore than we are doing
245413 hes a world class player but we cant expect him to do everything
245414 we have to step up as a team and if we do that well be a more competitive side we have to play a lot smarter
245415 we have to be smart about the way we play but also bring the physical side of things and the aggression if we are to get what we are after
245416 it changed my life in a way that all manchester people remind me of it which is nice in 30 years time people will remember me as a united player that is not the worst thing you can be remembered for it could have been as the guy who missed that great chance in the final
245417 my relationship with the fans has been absolutely fantastic since the first game i came on and no one knew who i was though the affection cannot only be down to that one goal there has to be something else they liked about me
245418 i went to angola a few months ago and you could see clearly how much things were needed down there
245419 the aim through my testimonial is to try and build 10 schools if i can generate more money through a scheme we have set up in norway maybe we can generate enough to build five more
245420 as a father i recognize how helpless these kids are if it was my children i would do absolutely anything for them so it is more important for me to be remembered for helping these people than anything i have done with football
245421 the things that made ole succeed as a player will make him succeed in management
245422 hes got great determination and focus as well as a great ability to learn and these qualities are the same as those you need to be a successful manager
245423 unfortunately the news about marcos is not good he wont just miss the olympic games but also the us open
245424 certainly marcos has been unlucky this year and now he is missing out on his big dream the olympic games
245425 we received a third party allegation at 12 09am on wednesday that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street
245426 officers established the incident had occurred at around 10 20pm on tuesday
245427 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue

245430 in the second half of this year when the global economy recovers and the nations cross strait economic deregulation provides a real boost to the local economy
245431 we are experiencing a bear market which may only hit the bottom and rebound in three to five years time because it wont be easy to increase income growth in the years to come
245432 we do not feel any pressure to lower equipment loading we will run our factory at full capacity
245433 hannstar made a correct choice by changing its product strategy the company would have lost competitiveness as bigger competitors are making computer panels at less costly plants
245434 i think it will be easier for a small company like hannstar to weather the new downcycle than its peers as hannstar has a healthier financial structure and it will not be under as much heavy pressure to sell its panels as big rivals
245435 with the taiwan office opening a year ago this is the first time corel has had an official presence in taiwan to help market and service taiwan customers we believe in the taiwan market and we are digging in here
245436 whats unique about coreldraw is that through each generation the company adopts feedback from customers to better improve the product this is a user friendly software with no prior training required which sets it apart from photoshop and other illustration software
245437 cpcs decision was in light of the two typhoons tropical storm kalmaegi and typhoon fung wong that hit the nation last month a lot of families are still struggling to rebuild their homes and the company feels the publics pain and is willing to absorb the rising costs
245438 this seems like a smart move but the question remains whether it cpc will follow the rules of the game and adjust domestic oil prices this month
245439 it is only a short term solution i do not think this is a good resolution the government tried it before last year but it failed
245440 people have become more cautious on spending their disposable income especially for goods such as cars that require a large amount of money
245441 leading domestic chipmakers have trimmed their growth forecast for the third quarter on falling demand from the us and other countries
245442 the industry used to post two digit growth but the pace is expected to slow to a single digit
245443 the eu is doing this imposing 14 percent tariffs in an attempt to attract taiwanese lcd firms who wish to avoid high tariffs to set up factories in eastern europe and to learn from our experience
245444 the office will be watching out for any possible moves by the eu on the issue
245445 the central bank could turn its focus to help exporters now that the us outlook is not all that good
245446 foreign investors are selling stocks because higher energy and labor costs are hurting profits at exporters
245447 marks the companys largest in history so politicians and consumers are likely to express outrage in face of record gasoline prices
245448 at the same time exxonmobil shareholders are disappointed with the earnings
245449 were partly offset by lower refining and chemical margins lower production volumes and higher operating costs
245450 while big oil is making record profits american families are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
245451 for far too long weve had an energy policy that has worked for the oil companies barack obama is calling for an energy policy that works for the american people and thats a change that we cant wait any longer to make
245452 with this step siemens is rigorously continuing its strategy of focusing on the three sectors energy industry and healthcare
245453 wont karen be surprised when i comment on her blog today since all i ever do is lurk there
245454 we are going to take back the bank of venezuela to put it at the service of venezuelans
245455 i dont believe were going to see chavez nationalizing banks and banks and banks
245456 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along
245457 im not so sure those gains are sustainable exports are likely to slow with the slowdown in europe and japan
245458 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry

245685 it is obvious that senator lautenberg is failing to make the interests new jersey taxpayers his top priority
245686 la nica verdad en esta vida y la nica fuerza es el amor

245692 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
245693 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
245694 the sporting editors had also given me 300 in cash most of which was already spent on extremely dangerous drugs the trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab we had two bags of grass 75 pellets of mescaline five sheets of high powered blotter acid a saltshaker half full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers downers screamers laughers and also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of budweiser a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls all this had been rounded up the night before in a frenzy of high speed driving all over los angeles county from topanga to watts we picked up everything we could get our hands on not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the ether there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon probably at the next gas station we had sampled almost everything else and now yes it was time for a long snort of ether and then do the next 100 miles in a horrible slobbering sort of spastic stupor the only way to keep alert on ether is to do up a lot of amyls not all at once but steadily just enough to maintain the focus at 90 miles an hour through barstow
245695 the anniversary of the bridge collapse is this friday and the convention isnt for a month after that the two things arent really related
245696 a tragedy of that kind raises national visibility to those kinds of decisions
245697 they are based on a bunch of different factors and the weight nominees give to them
245698 i would certainly hope that while members are in minnesota they would visit the new bridge and reflect on the countrys need for infrastructure funding
245699 everyone is very careful about not making the i 35 bridge an issue
245700 gov rendell and mayor bloomberg wanted to highlight the infrastructure issue but didnt do it in a way to involve the bridge both were sensitive that people died there
245701 it takes away flexibility from the states to spend the money where its most needed
245702 democrats said bates 93 page ruling vindicated their dogged efforts to check potential abuses under bush and tentatively set hearings for september they said they expected white house officials to appear then to answer questions about the controversy over the fired prosecutors which led to the resignation of bush confidant and former atty gen alberto r gonzales last year
245703 bates left unresolved whether administration officials would be justified in refusing to answer specific questions under the doctrine of executive privilege
245704 that question and an anticipated white house appeal means the controversy is likely to spill over into the next administration where it could raise novel legal questions about whether ex presidents have the power to assert executive privilege after they have left office
245705 bates said he hoped that lawyers for the two branches would settle the dispute and avoid further litigation he scheduled a conference for aug 27 to discuss their progress
245706 the practical significance of the opinion will depend chiefly on whether the investigations persist into the next congress and on how the new administration responds said peter m shane a professor at ohio state universitys law school
245707 he said there might be interesting questions yet presented about the authority of an ex president to make even qualified executive privilege claims on behalf of his former aides but he said that in general it is up to the incumbent president to decide while in office what is in the best interests of the executive branch as an institution
245708 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
245709 were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements were hoping well get some feedback from apple today sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time well do our best to try to get the application back onto the appstore if at all possible at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering
245710 now go away or i shall taunt you a second time
245711 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
245712 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
245713 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the work around for the protocol weakness
245714 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomization to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks

245719 of course the likely response to this from any halfway sophisticated postmodernist will simply be to deny that there is this kind of a mind independent reality consider for example the work of french sociologist bruno latour in his book

245731 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp
245732 the claim is in our opinion a shamelessly transparent attempt to generate as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
245733 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages
245734 this abuse certainly has not seemed to affect his recent round of interviews or his golf swing over the weekend is this not the same man who is renowned as a professional stuntman in all his movies

245742 ms palin is a popular governor known as a reformer and a fiscal conservative
245743 amplifying his case that new york faces a grave financial crisis gov david a paterson asked the federal government on thursday for assistance and said that social programs like education and health care were not immune from cutbacks his remarks delivered to the national press club just before meetings with members of congress the treasury secretary henry m paulson jr and ben s bernanke the federal reserve chairman were the surest sign yet that the governor and the state legislature were headed toward a confrontation over where to trim the budget two of the legislatures leaders dean g skelos the senate majority leader and sheldon silver the speaker of the assembly have been explicit in their opposition to any cuts in school financing
245744 the house of representatives blocked a resolution on thursday to censure representative charles b rangel the powerful new york democrat who is chairman of the ways and means committee the resolution said he dishonored himself and brought discredit to the house by occupying four rent stabilized apartments in a harlem building including one that he used as a campaign office
245745 already scrambling to salvage republican control of the state senate majority leader dean skelos faces added political pressure now that gov david a paterson has demanded immediate action to avert a fiscal crisis

245757 rice was counting on the fact that olmerts dwindling political fortunes would lead him to turn to a diplomatic victory as a springboard toward a political comeback but if hes leaving office that doesnt happen

245761 theyre the ones who are negotiating but our goal is still as stated getting an agreement by the end of the year that addresses all the final status issues
245762 the best we can hope for is a stabilization package that will make it easier for the next president to engage the process

245772 and then you realize that the peanut butter chocolate chip cookies have huge chunks of peanuts and peanut butter and you fucking lose it
245773 calvin preached without notes and it would seem direct from his hebrew old and greek new testament he had little time for immediate preparation but his close knowledge of the bible and his wide reading stood always at the command of his memory moreover he had after all written commentaries on many of the books he was expounding perhaps all his preparation was to refresh his mind and give thought to the application of the passage to the congregation and the situation
245774 and so we trace him preaching on sundays with one hundred and eighty nine sermons on the acts between 1549 and 1554 a shorter series on some of the pauline letters between 1554 and 1558 and the sixty five on the harmony of the gospels between 1559 and 1564 during this time the weekdays saw series on jeremiah and lamentations up to 1550 on the minor prophets and daniel 1550 2 the one hundred and seventy four on ezekiel 1552 4 the one hundred and fifty nine on job 1554 5 the two hundred on deuteronomy 1555 6 the three hundred and forty two on isaiah 1556 9 then one hundred twenty three on genesis 1559 61 a short set on judges 1561 one hundred and seven on 1 samuel and eighty seven on 2 samuel 1561 3 and a set on 1 kings 1563 4 before he smiles at such unusual activity of the pulpit the reader would do well to ask himself whether he would prefer to listen to the second hand views on a religion of social ethics or the ill digested piety delivered in slipshod english that he will hear today in most churches of whatever denomination he may enter or three hundred and forty two sermons on the book of the prophet isaiah sermons born of an infinite passion of faith and a burning sincerity sermons luminous with theological sense lively with wit and imagery showing depths of compassion and the unquenchable joyousness of hope those in geneva who listened sunday after sunday day after day and did not shut their ears but were instructed admonished exhorted and censured received a training in christianity such as had been given to few congregations in europe since the days of the fathers
245775 preaching is also bound formally to scripture and that so closely that it must always be exposition of scripture
245776 you are not gandhi or nelson mandela for choosing not to have sex

245778 its less about stopping you from sweating but more about saving the world
245779 following discussions the ioc held with bocog and chinese authorities regarding difficulties experienced this week in accessing some web sites the ioc is pleased to see that the issues are being quickly resolved
245780 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to websites that they need to report on the olympic games
245781 we welcome the news today that the authorities have lifted blocks on our website in the olympics media venues and possibly elsewhere in beijing
245782 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfil the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
245783 some sites are blocked under chinese law but i do not have further information on which
245784 this partial lifting of censorship shows that the chinese government is not completely insensitive to pressure
245785 if the whole world had mobilised as early as 2001 before the games were attributed to beijing maybe the situation today would be different perhaps journalists would have been released before the opening ceremony
245786 the fact that more people in the united states are infected with hiv every year than previously thought shows that we need to be working much harder to control the epidemic in the united states
245787 the united states can be proud of having more than tripled its remarkable commitment to the global hiv aids epidemic
245788 these new figures from the cdc demonstrate that the domestic epidemic needs a similar response we call on the federal government to renew its commitment to prevention care and research into the hiv aids epidemic in the united states
245789 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
245790 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
245791 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
245792 listen i think everyone hopes this will bring some luck
245793 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
245794 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
245795 there is obviously concern about how hurricane activity might change in the future
245796 by studying how it has varied naturally in the past we can better understand the underlying factors that affect hurricane development
245797 fortunately we can turn to the geologic record to extend our understanding of hurricane activity further looking back 1 000 years or more
245798 lower mystic lake offered a fantastic opportunity for a boston area record because each year is represented by a discrete layer of sediment called a varve that accumulates at the bottom of the lake
245799 you can count these varves like tree rings to go back in time
245800 a hurricane strike often causes vegetation disturbance and tree blow down which exposes lots of fresh loose sediment
245801 the intense precipitation associated with hurricanes picked up the sediment and deposited it in the lake to form the graded beds containing coarser sediment that we see
245802 long term records like those from mystic lake provide climate modelers with a way of testing if their understanding of changes in hurricane activity over time are correct
245803 if their models can reproduce the past record correctly we have more confidence in their simulations of future changes
245804 the scientific community is actively debating the importance of other factors such as wind shear that affect hurricane development on longer timescales
245805 we really need more records like the one from mystic lake from other areas to help answer these questions with confidence
245806 we know that fios will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force
245807 having said that it would be unfortunate if a strike comes but well deal with it if and when it comes
245808 labor will continue to go to work without a contract while the union leadership ratchets up its rhetoric regarding the need for a contract and verizon expresses optimism a fair agreement is possible
245809 when the fracture results in nanoplates it leads to a low level of fracture energy at a certain size resulting in a size specific fracture
245810 it also may prove useful in the deliberate creation of large quantities of stable nanostructures
245811 thus the phonon confinement should occur instantaneously as the crack propagates
245812 this could have important consequences not only for small materials but also for the way cracks propagate in nanostructured bulk materials
245813 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
245814 its not that unemployment is rising because a lot of people are coming into the labor force

245821 mark called me and we talked pretty much the entire day
245822 everything we talked about that day never happened because september 11 happened and it changed our perception of how we wanted to run the book it was originally much more like authority balls to the wall knocking buildings down killing people excessive violence in a marvel style sort of way
245823 i didnt do a lot of drawings on there i just got dragged into big meetings and throw ideas out

245835 it would be nice to have a guy who could give us that home run ability at the rb position like weve seen a lot of young backs do recently
245836 thats like a cliche now i dont think that applies to me because after all ive done and the way i take care of my body im not even concerned with that i see some guys who havent even played as long as ive played theyre missing practices and not able to play every game
245837 everything seems ok except when he really opens it up
245838 were going to get him checked out with an mri just to make sure theres nothing going on in there that we dont know about but i think its getting closer and hopefully by this weekend well be able to really test it out

245852 i can only assure you that all immigration decisions about mr wieczorek have been and will be made in light of all available and relevant information
245853 surely were not so desperate for skilled staff that we have to import criminals it amazes me that someone who has been convicted of theft as a servant in a responsible position in a company is still welcome in new zealand
245854 certainly he was convicted and he was sentenced to a term in prison but it was suspended and he was put on probation
245855 hes not an axe murderer its his only brush with the law
245856 the thing that got this guy in is that theres a shortage of electricians
245857 the decision to overturn the original decision not to grant mr wieczorek a work permit was made by a senior official at the department and not by shane jones there was no political involvement
245858 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
245859 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run
245860 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me
245861 as an indie rock label we dont sign things thinking that theyre going to blow up the label itself has a history of admiring new zealand bands
245862 things are just getting more and more hilarious it has been a little bit hard for me to digest everything its kind of mounting up
245863 it had got beatle esque in paris they have never experienced anything like it people were falling over themselves
245864 i was surprised that they called and to be invited again is even nicer
245865 i just say to myself one more and thats all i ask for to get one in the new stadium next year is all i want
245866 you have darryl strawberry out there the other guys were there geez do you really belong here but yeah i do because in 1960 i had a pretty good year with them
245867 i was really non committal because what the hell you are 72 and you have already had your time
245868 when i walked back into the stadium it all came back because you always think why am i coming back i was there two years you know but once you get in there and put on the uniform and walk out onto the field its holy smokes it is just really thrilling
245869 how many guys in this country are called freakin eli grba that played for the new york yankees not too many
245870 basically team first coughlin said summing up the generals comments
245871 first i tell them about how all the players came up to me afterwards and first said how much theyre indebted to the soldiers and marines in iraq
245872 its amazing how much it means to them when youre in a day to day grind and you come back from that day and track your football team whoever it might be
245873 i know that the first question is going to be why haven t there been any fights yet no that wasnt the first question but anyone wanting to know about such things would invariably head to seubert who is the kind of training camp fights
245874 we are confirming that based on our investigation he will not be suspended for conduct that occurred prior to his nfl career
245875 hes been one of the most excited people to be here
245876 hes a happy guy and no matter what you ask him to do whether it is the scout team or special teams whatever it might be hes responded in a positive way to everything
245877 he used the analogy of the soldiers for when our guys are struggling out here and think its hot
245878 its 120 degrees in iraq and theyre wearing a hundred pounds worth of gear they are out there for four and five hours at a time im sure that analogy struck home with the guys
245879 i tell them about how all the players came up to me afterwards and first said how much they are indebted to the soldiers and marines in iraq

245923 the regime will now avoid any compromise or anything that would weaken their already weakened position because if they are forced from office they face trials before the icc

246004 among affluent mothers who live within 200 meters of a highway the odds of delivering an infant with low birth weight increase by 81 percent while their odds of delivering a pre term baby increase by 58 percent compared to mothers who dont live anywhere close to expressways
246005 advantaged mothers may be more susceptible to environmental hazards because they have been protected from other hazards these mothers may be particularly susceptible to exposure to air pollution during pregnancy which is hypothesized to interfere directly with intrauterine growth via pollutant absorption and placental exchange or indirectly by increasing maternal susceptibility to infection or impairing maternal respiratory function

246016 this is the first case within the church in which a bishop receives a dispensation
246017 yes there have been many other priests the pope has left in the status of layman but never a member of the hierarchy until today
246018 its a great pain for the church to lose a bishop a priest whom we tried to dissuade from the political option up to the last day of his election campaign
246019 but the holy father recognized that he was elected by the majority of the people to lead paraguay for the next five years
246020 id like to sincerely thank his holiness pope benedict for a decision that hasnt been easy for the vatican
246021 they reconsidered my request for a dispensation for the good of the country
246022 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
246023 he was a practical man he applied the march separately but strike together approach of mao in the indian context first by ending the congres monopoly and then by stopping the bjps ride
246024 he became a politburo member of the undivided communist party in 1954 the period between 1953 and 1964 when he headed the cpis state unit was among the most productive for the communist movement in punjab
246025 surjeet would make mental notes of peoples strengths and weaknesses even his factionalism was in the interests of the movement he would say
246026 because he kept a low profile in the early years and made up for what he lacked in education through organisation skills
246027 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
246028 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
246029 there are lots of ways these things become viral and this is the ebola virus of 2008
246030 i think his guys are brilliant theyd better take steps to inoculate him
246031 we went to the pool at the maldives resort together he kept egging us to come into deeper water even though none of us knew swimming he even mocked his drowning once and laughed it off the second time which we realized later that he was actually drowning we didnt take it seriously we shouted for help but it was too late
246032 this place maldives is so beautiful mujhe toh koi yahan naukri dey de main toh yahan hi reh jaunga if someone gives me a job here i will live here only
246033 it is hard to believe that the voice of india ishmeet singh is no more like a shooting star hes come and gone in a blink of the eye
246034 he promised that his first album would be of shabads because he took his role as an icon for the sikh youth seriously ishmeet to me was really special because his success had not gone to his head and at heart he remained the sweet simple boy from ludhiana with the love of sikhi swelling in his heart
246035 he saw himself as blazing a trail for his young sikh brothers and sisters who he hoped would follow their dreams achieving great successes while proudly displaying the khalsa form and spirit he felt that he had been given a great responsibility to inspire and to coax the best out of the sikh youth
246036 no one said a word to me during the attack
246037 these abuses have been well documented for many years yet our pleas for intervention have fallen on deaf ears
246038 the lack of will by the international community to uphold the rule of law when it comes to the occupied territories is deeply disturbing
246039 a man showed me a piece of paper in hebrew a language muhammad doesnt speak and told me if i signed it i would be released so i did
246040 immediately he told me that i had just signed a confession and that i should now expect a prison sentence
246041 the only news we received were two calls from muhammad on phones smuggled into the jail and then an update from a released prisoner who told us when muhammad was due to be let out of prison
246042 he is my firstborn and used to help me around the house all the time
246043 on top of that we were constantly worried about what had happened to our son since we had no way of getting in touch with him
246044 he has lost an academic year of his studies and also suffered greatly psychologically
246045 the eu professes support for human rights principles and yet has turned a blind eye to grave human rights abuses for economic and political expediency

246126 so far there has been no real uptick in credit problems many of the developers provide their own financing to their timeshare buyers and so theyre not immediately affected when banks cut back on their lending

246128 only a small fraction of american homeowners at this point own timeshares so the sky is the limit this remains a very vibrant industry

246184 it was the summer before the 2004 presidential election and i had gotten interested in many of the political bloggers especially those who were invited to attend the two presidential conventions the 2004 convention year was the first time bloggers were given journalistic access to the convention by invitation and i thought the insight they brought was so much more interesting than the normal television news reports
246185 so i decided to create a blog with a more local point of view collinsville metro east st louis illinois missouri etc even though i couldnt and still cant resist some national posts the first day i set up an account with blogger but was only a couple of hours into it when i realized i did not care for that format i looked at several blog companies and settled on typepad that first day i had no idea about the future of the blog it took several hours to come up with a name design sidebar items and all the rest
246186 it took me only a couple of days before i knew i loved blogging i learned as i went along on how to use feeds and google to attract readers little by little i branched out my categories adding subjects i was interested in like food the seminary pets sports etc each of those categories seems to bring a different set of visitors to the site
246187 what i enjoy the most is how much i have learned by having a blog ive only missed posting one or two days during the four years and those two days were due to the death of my father posting means doing a lot of reading in newspapers on other blogs going to meetings attending events and with each of those things ive filled up on an almost ridiculous amount of facts opinion and understanding and just as good ive been able to meet and talk to so many people who read the blog people i probably would never have come across otherwise

246223 the wasl eats up 10 of classroon instruction time just to administer it it does not give educators quick information that could lead to individualized learning plans and has been nationally criticized as being a poorly constructed test that drives curriculum rather than measuring its success

246236 we should hire three or four colored ministers preferably with social service backgrounds and with engaging personalities the most successful educational approach to the negro is through a religious appeal we dont want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members
246237 eugenic sterilization is an urgent need we must prevent multiplication of this bad stock
246238 eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial political and social problems
246239 birth control itself often denounced as a violation of natural law is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit of preventing the birth of defectives or of those who will become defectives
246240 the campaign for birth control is not merely of eugenic value but is practically identical with the final aims of eugenics
246241 our failure to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism philanthropists encourage the healthier and more normal sections of the world to shoulder the burden of unthinking and indiscriminate fecundity of others which brings with it as i think the reader must agree a dead weight of human waste instead of decreasing and aiming to eliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of the race and the world it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant we are paying for and even submitting to the dictates of an ever increasing unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all
246242 the undeniably feeble minded should indeed not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their kind
246243 the third group of society are those irresponsible and reckless ones having little regard for the consequences of their acts or whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers many of this group are diseased feeble minded and are of the pauper element dependent upon the normal and fit members of society for their support there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped
246244 the marriage bed is the most degenerative influence in the social order
246245 our objective is unlimited sexual gratification without the burden of unwanted children
246246 give dysgenic groups people with bad genes in our population their choice of segregation or compulsory sterilization

246282 i dont think the best tactic is to come out with names
246283 now we have to work hard together as a family and to deliver better than what we did last season
246284 what we hope to achieve is the title and the champions league but at the moment the most important thing is to pass through because we have a qualifying game to play in the champions league

246300 however although they have many good players we need to show we can compete with them and learn so we can go to the olympics with confidence
246301 we had a meeting with ochoa to tell him we refused the offer from everton and galatasarays proposal was just unsatisfactory
246302 neither us or the player think that a loan for a player of the quality of ochoa is something serious
246303 we have arranged with ochoa that beside the fact he has a contract with america until 2010 if an important offer appears next year we will do all we can do to transfer him because good players like him deserve to be transferred to a european team and improve their career
246304 but for the moment ochoa will stay in america until december at least and after that we will see

246317 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem

246359 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
246360 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
246361 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both

246391 barack is one of the smartest people you will ever encounter who will deign to enter this messy thing called politics
246392 have you had a strong sense of having a mission or an important task to perform without knowing from where this compulsion comes

246396 you know i dont know and i dont presume to know what i know is there is life here on earth and and that were not attending to life here on earth were not taking care of kids who are alive and unfortunately are not getting health care were not taking care of senior citizens who are alive and are seeing their heating prices go up so as president those are the people i will be attending to first

246398 maintaining linux libre takes me two to three minutes a day most of the time no clean up is required because the non free bits in linux tend to remain in place and i have scripts that will let me know whether theres anything new that requires manual intervention it took me several workdays to write these scripts and i still tweak them every now and then but its mostly trivial maintenance these days when a new linux release comes up it takes me just a few minutes of attention to prepare a freed tarball because ive been accumulating the preparation for it throughout its development cycle
246399 its not a community that values users freedom as much as it values convenience
246400 i had reports from developers involved with gnewsense and blag another free distribution whod tried to submit patches to clean up non free software from linux and who had been lets say laughed and cursed out of the room
246401 the idea of adding yet another kernel split was perceived as a risk of bringing all that grief back so the idea of offering additional kernels built out of linux libre was vetoed
246402 it does nothing to address the problem of other obscure chunks of code in the kernel often derived from documentation under non disclosure agreements or from non free drivers that dont offer permission for the code to be distributed under the gnu general public license
246403 to build a complete general purpose operating system exclusively from free software
246404 thats a question i ask myself every time i face this kind of hostility
246405 i expected negative reactions to the idea of replacing the non free kernel
246406 but i thought adding an alternative 100 free kernel built out of 100 free sources was going to be a no brainer
246407 and id really like to be able to recommend to people out there a distro that the company i work for helps create it was quite disappointing that a community that set out to create an operating system exclusively from free software would not permit anyone to install or distribute a system without also installing or distributing non free software
246408 ever thought it was difficult to write software for linux for multiple distros internetnews reports that the lsb is making a push for their next release due out later this year that should help
246409 the reason you need that is because we dont want what happened to unix to happen to linux in terms of fragmentation

246482 when i look in the mirror i feel sad and go to my bedroom and cry
246483 i loved playing the violin and it would be amazing to start playing again
246484 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
246485 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
246486 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
246487 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
246488 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
246489 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
246490 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
246491 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
246492 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
246493 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
246494 if they have a sensor that can detect differences in balance it is fairly easy to train the elderly using physical therapy to improve their balance
246495 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
246496 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
246497 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
246498 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
246499 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
246500 obamas bad press 72 percent negative comes at a time when he was much more visible than mccain 57 percent
246501 is more to the left than the announced socialist in the united states senate bernie sanders of vermont
246502 what do we really know of his ever changing positions on the issues
246503 look what a bare knuckle calculating politician this so called reformer really is
246504 the nonpartisan project for excellence in journalism said obama was prominently featured in 82 of campaign stories during the third week of july while mccain was featured in just 52
246505 in the seven weeks since the primary season ended john mccain has logged 67 minutes on the three broadcast networks weekday nightly newscasts barack obama 166
246506 i dont think mccains comeback would have been possible had the political press not been scoring points for him all throughout 2007 his comeback was willed into existence by reporters you could find helpful analyses of what he could do to win as early as july last year its part of what makes the obama mccain battle a fair fight not a hopelessly lopsided fight both men are beloved by the press in a way no ones been since arguably carter in 1976 seriously look at the way the ridiculous wesley clark story was covered this month and try to argue that the medias being unfair to mccain
246507 youre welcome to believe otherwise but i dont think the press has gone in the tank for barack obama
246508 anyone whos studied mccains career with any intellectual detachment at all as opposed to the hagiographic tendencies of his media cheerleading claque could have told you the truth about john mccain is that hell do just about anything and say just about anything to win he always has hes just been more clever and cynical than most in how he goes about it

246516 there might be some lack of accurate media reporting we probably need a better communications strategy and more accommodating media coverage

246522 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
246523 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
246524 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
246525 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
246526 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money
246527 the story on digitimes is completely groundless we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business
246528 in fact our mcp business is as strong as it ever has been for both intel platforms
246529 mercury research has reported that the nvidia market share of amd platforms in q208 was 60
246530 we have been steady in this range for over two years

246533 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
246534 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
246535 the fccs ruling today sends a clear message to policymakers the public and wall street that the fcc will not tolerate companies blocking or slowing down internet content
246536 proof that engineering challenges on the internet should be solved by engineers not government officials
246537 in second guessing reasonable network management techniques with no notice or guidelines in place that benefit the overwhelming number of broadband subscribers in america the fcc has inexplicably elevated the interests of a few bandwidth hogs over everyone else
246538 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
246539 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
246540 it is much more promising that tomorrows internet will be free and open and democratic without companies like comcast controlling what they can see how fast it loads and what it costs
246541 given the current state of the economy we are encouraged by the high number of workers feeling secure in their jobs and the rise in the percentage of workers who are confident in the future of their employers

246552 in den vergangenen paar rennen hat es nat rlich ziemlich viele zwischenf lle mit dem safety car gegeben
246553 angesichts des aktuellen reglements kann man diesbez glich gl ck haben es war schon immer der fall gewesen dass man mit dem safety car gl ck haben kann und dies passierte piquet im vergangenen rennen die leute k nnen in solch einer situation gl ck haben aber gleichzeitig muss man sagen dass er danach eine gute geschwindigkeit hatte ein gro artiges rennen fuhr und das maximum aus ihm gemacht hat
246554 die leute sind ziemlich verwirrt und ich denke nicht dass sie das erreichen was man sich vorgestellt hat wir m ssen uns das also meiner meinung nach anschauen es ist jedoch gut f r die formel 1 wenn solche dinge passieren
246555 wir hatten sehr un bliche zwischenf lle sehr schwierige rennen das wetter spielte seine rolle unterschiedliche asphalt temperaturen zwischenf lle und safety cars die safety car regel ist im moment ein wirkliches gl cksspiel kann den ausgang des rennens deutlich ver ndern wir schauen uns das zusammen mit der fia an um ein besseres system zu haben ich denke dass es verbessert werden kann

246566 he dejado la puerta abierta hasta el final pero la noche antes de cerrar la negociaci n esa puerta se cerr
246567 miro hacia atr s y veo cinco a os de mi vida muy felices me quedo con lo positivo y voy a apoyar al levante desde fuera
246568 dicen que los malos momentos cuanto antes se borren mejor pero en estos ltimos ocho meses he aprendido que hay gente por la que merece la pena levantarse cada d a con ganas de luchar y darlo todo
246569 una persona honrada que trat de dar el m ximo
246570 la mejor manera es mantener la boca cerrada en algunos momentos yo s lo que he vivido en primera persona y muchos de mis compa eros tambi n
246571 un hombre que es el futbolista que m s a os ha jugado en el f tbol profesional en la historia del levante once temporadas creo que tendr a que tener m s de una l nea en la p gina oficial
246572 si hubiese optado por buscarse otra salida la hubiera encontrado y estaba vinculado a un club a una ciudad
246573 merece un lugar importante entre los deportistas del levante y me gustar a que se reconociera desde el club y la afici n
246574 le voy a dar a mi familia mucho protagonismo en la decisi n
246575 but you dont and i told her that told her she was completely wrong and too damn fussy said you probably know more stuff than her too
246576 you told your aunt muriel that a seventeen year old muggle born witch with skinny ankles and too much hair knows more than her
246577 youve turned out just fine not having money thrown at you at every turn ron weasley you dont need her money
246578 i got ginny to teach me before you and harry got here mum said if i didnt dance id have to de gnome the garden for the rest of my life so i asked ginny and she said that she would help me because she didnt want me to ruin your shoes by standing on your feet all night
246579 well i was hardly going to dance with anyone else was i
246580 definitely suppose we should go find harry weve been gone a while
246581 i might just go get a drink first did you want one
246582 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward
246583 on days its not windy we use up our credit
246584 last year we were probably getting a call a week or every two weeks
246585 when youre buying a renewable energy system youre hedging future cost increases
246586 at the same time youre pre buying renewable energy for 30 to 40 years
246587 but if we create the situation where individuals can do this and make it easier for them then this will ultimately reduce our dependency on power produced by fossil fuel
246588 i think theres still a lot of misconceptions around wind turbines and a fair amount of public resistance to them
246589 a lot of people think of solar energy when they think of producing energy at home but this is just another alternative
246590 we had some concerns about it because theres an effort by the state to limit towns ability to exercise their zoning power
246591 the wind makes the blades spin around and makes the generator rotate inside a bunch of copper wire that makes electrons move and creates electricity
246592 i dont know of anyone else making maple syrup with wind and solar power
246593 we believe it is critical to conduct efficient foreclosure sales using the latest technology and we are prepared to lead the way with online property sales
246594 we look forward to increasing the number of bidders providing a fair process for all and saving taxpayers money
246595 the duval clerk of the courts office will see dramatic reductions in staff time for data entry as well as paper generation
246596 the average homeowner spends 3 days a year doing this
246597 well it really depends do they mean some portion of 3 different days over the year or do they mean like 72 cumulative hours throughout the year
246598 our office looks forward to an increase in the number of bidders on each property
246599 the more bidders we attract the more likely the property will sell at the highest amount possible reducing the paperwork in this process yields a direct savings to taxpayers and saves our staff time
246600 with documentation history and property details uploaded to a dedicated web site for all bidders the bidders
246601 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
246602 if you raise taxes to fund the plan the people who are taxed are poorer and theyll spend less if you borrow money to fund the plan the people who buy the government bonds have less money to spend and that offsets the stimulus its like taking a bucket of water from the deep end of a pool and dumping it into the shallow end funny thing the water in the shallow end doesnt get any deeper whoever gets stimulated is likely to be offset by someone who gets unstimulated
246603 reduced domestic oil production from between 3 and 6 percent and increased oil imports from between 8 and 16 percent

246627 we know the hispanic community is in need of increased education on the benefits of diagnosing and treating ad early
246628 this news should serve as a call to action for hispanic families to watch for early signs of ad among their loved ones and speak with a doctor as soon as possible if symptoms are suspected
246629 all too often hispanics dismiss the symptoms of ad as signs of normal aging and wait years before consulting a doctor

246696 theoretically i am absolutely in support for getting rid of the earnings tax
246697 we are a nation of immigrants and we are nation of laws
246698 the problem that i see isnt the number of immigrants that are coming we are actually advantaged by the number of immigrants coming the fact that were getting people who still want to come to this country and live out the american dream thats all good
246699 that means cracking down on employers who are hiring undocumented workers and only paying them minimum wage and not paying them overtime
246700 we need adequate border security we need to provide a pathway for citizenship for those undocumented workers who are here who have put down roots we need to get them out of the shadows theyll have to pay a fine theyll have to learn english but lets give them an avenue to become fully part of the american society
246701 we have to make sure we have a realistic approach
246702 frankly we are probably underrepresented when it comes to immigrants from certain parts of the world its harder for haitians to immigrate than it is for persons from other countries in some cases thats something we need to prevent
246703 multifaceted fabric interwoven with markedly different aesthetic theoretical and functional threads
246704 the promo cds are unordered merchandise by sending the promo cds to music industry insiders umg transferred title to those insiders and the promo cds are subject to the first sale doctrine
246705 it was clear to the court that these cds were the property of mr augusto and therefore he had the right to resell them
246706 copyright holders cant strip consumers of their first sale rights just by sticking a not for sale label on a cd

246717 in february of 07 we decided that we wanted to become a statewide organization
246718 we wanted to get young black dems and really anybody who wants to be involved were an inclusive organization involved in what were doing around the state
246719 we would go to barber shops and beauty salons talking to patrons letting them know who was on the whole ticket and why they should vote for them
246720 the barbershops and beauty salons are pretty sacred places for black people so that was a really big hit for us because we were able to engage in conversations people brought up different issues they really enjoyed the fact that we actually had candidates with us because they were able to get a one on one with the mayor or councilman or party chairman and then to see the young people involved it really got them going
246721 our goal is to really work with the campaigns to see what they need from us
246722 but what we offer is our constituency is the young african american so we want to target the urban areas
246723 were going out knocking on doors saying hey we like this candidate
246724 just having a presence around has been a huge deal for these candidates but we also want to make sure we get out the vote that the black people come out and vote because we really want to see them in office we want them representing us in the state of ohio
246725 its going to be a challenge were serious before this challenge its important to us that we have a great relationship with these candidates its important to us that they win and the african american community plays a crucial part in that
246726 the is no reason why this country cannot become the least reliant on foreign sources of energy i call it the second declaration of independence than any other country in the world

246732 many people consider the things which government does for them to be social progress but they consider the things government does for others as socialism
246733 its amazing how many people show up when you give them a rock band and free beer
246734 it appears the people in europe are more astute than you and the rest of the 28 percenters mccain goaded him into making a trip abroad obama saw him and raised him and now mccain and his neocon supporters are whining like overgrown crybabies
246735 you really do think obama is the antichrist dont you funny i recognized him in dick cheney nearly eight years ago
246736 he seems to have struck a chord with america i can only speculate that the reason is america is mesmerized by a black man carrying himself in such a calm composed presidential manner
246737 the only reason obama is where he is is because he is black he is the affirmative action candidate of the democratic party
246738 in this case the products violate a persons beliefs so i think there is cause to protect them i think the aclu should represent them in fact both sides let them spend their billions fighting with themselves
246739 the problem with pharmacists not dispensing birth control because it violates their personal convictions is that pharmacists are licensed by the state can a pharmacist refuse to dispense aids medication because he or she believes homosexuals are being punished by god
246740 people need access to birth control if you dont feel comfortable dispensing it find a new job same for cabbie or check out clerk people should look up the job description before applying
246741 its true that some idiots think women should be punished with being forced to have a child its archaic its paternalistic its theocratic and its sick get out of womens uteruses and mind your own business
246742 the baby grows in the mothers stomach then it comes out of her belly button
246743 hopefully one day there will be no birth control and if you feel the need to have sex out of wedlock or with a stranger use some damned saran wrap if you are so desperate
246744 i know a lot of people slam mccain for his failed relationship with his first wife but that can happen to anyone its the rest of what hes done how hes lived who he is that shows what kind of a man he is its obvious that hes qualified to be president
246745 in 2000 i would have voted for him in a heartbeat it is the changes in his convictions that concern me greatly the only assumption i can make for the changes in his position on so many topics is exactly partisan politics he needed to cave to the republican party to get the nomination
246746 that wasnt nearly as scary as cnn is making it out to be
246747 didnt feel a thing here in virginia ah well maybe next time

246763 very good progress in our sustainable revenue components and from the favourable cost trend
246764 after these violent attacks we have had to suspend activities and evacuate all our staff from tawila and shangil tobaya
246765 it was a difficult decision because this suspension of activities leaves the people with no medical care but it is impossible for our teams to work and provide medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for humanitarian work
246766 we hope administration efforts working with the congress will help our fellow citizens close a painful chapter in their lives

246768 lord when we were in the garden you walked with us every day now we do not see you any more we are lonesome here and it is difficult for us to remember how much you love us
246769 i will create a companion for you that will be with you and who will be a reflection of my love for you so that you will love me even when you cannot see me regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be this new companion will accept you as you are and will love you as i do in spite of yourselves
246770 lord i have already named all the animals in the kingdom and i cannot think of a name for this new animal
246771 i have created this new animal to be a reflection of my love for you his name will be a reflection of my own name and you will call him dog
246772 lord adam and eve have become filled with pride they strut and preen like peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration dog has indeed taught them that they are loved but perhaps too well
246773 i will create for them a companion who will be with them and who will see them as they are the companion will remind them of their limitations so they will know that they are not always worthy of adoration

246780 are a massive blow to the british government which claimed to have grasped the holy grail of climate policy de coupling economic growth from emissions growth
246781 the government sat on the defra sei report since february tested its calculations then published it in an obscure press release on 2 july
246782 this shows our uk claims on emissions are simply a big lie the government has known about this for a very long time but has just refused to face up to it
246783 but officer it only said 25 doesnt that make it so
246784 it is a longstanding practice for governors to accept and act upon bills presented to them on the day after adjournment
246785 most criticism of john mccains decision to follow the bush administrations lead and embrace offshore drilling as the answer to high gas prices has focused on the accusation that its junk economics which it is a mccain campaign ad says that gas prices are high right now because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america thats just plain dishonest the u s governments own energy information administration says that removing restrictions on offshore drilling wouldnt lead to any additional domestic oil production until 2017 and that even at its peak the extra production would have an insignificant impact on oil prices
246786 at the annual and the climatic 30 year scales gcm interpolated series are irrelevant to reality gcms do not reproduce natural over year fluctuations and generally underestimate the variance and the hurst coefficient of the observed series even worse when the gcm time series imply a hurst coefficient greater than 0 5 this results from a monotonic trend whereas in historical data the high values of the hurst coefficient are a result of large scale over year fluctuations i e successions of upward and downward trends the huge negative values of coefficients of efficiency show that model predictions are much poorer than an elementary prediction based on the time average this makes future climate projections at the examined locations not credible whether or not this conclusion extends to other locations requires expansion of the study which we have planned however the poor gcm performance in all eight locations examined in this study allows little hope if any an argument that the poor performance applies merely to the point basis of our comparison whereas aggregation at large spatial scales would show that gcm outputs are credible is an unproved conjecture and in our opinion a false one
246787 women have always and everywhere been in subjugation to men

246803 os exerc cios que s o feitos nos treinos j come aram a dar resultados j houve uma maior aproxima o os jogadores encostaram mais para as jogadas de tabela e os atacantes passaram a entrar em diagonal
246804 a sele o do vietn nos exigiu muito no aspecto f sico al m do desgaste natural que o time teve devido ao forte calor o que foi importante pois ser exatamente neste clima que as partidas acontecer o na china

246842 with american families and small businesses facing record high gasoline prices congress has adjourned to leave washington for a five week break the message this sends to the american people is bad enough its ramifications however are far worse you have the power to call congress back into session at any moment to deal with issues of urgent national importance
246843 no one can argue that the issue of high energy costs and their impact on american families does not rise to this level that is why we write today to request that you call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act h r 6566 such an action will ensure our nations energy crisis receives the attention and action it deserves
246844 it is well past time for congress to lift the ban on environmentally safe exploration for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf and act on other critical reforms to increase production of american energy and lower the price of gasoline
246845 we should not wait until september to do so and frankly we should not wait another day to do so congress should not take the next five weeks off while the american people suffer at the pump we respectfully request that you schedule a vote on the comprehensive american energy act during an emergency legislative session this month
246846 this band of brothers here is staying late to make a point to the american people we want to work
246847 the democratic congress is taking a month off rather than providing the american people with the relief at the gas pump that we need congress has a comprehensive energy bill pending but democrats chose to retreat rather than debate we deserve better than this
246848 it is time for our country to move forward with responsible drilling alternative energy production and the promotion of energy conservation if the democrats voting to recess saw how high gas prices in ohio are hurting businesses and families away from the marble steps of the capitol they would have a very rude awakening

246862 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
246863 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
246864 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
246865 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
246866 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money

246868 i appreciate that there are extra costs in transporting fuel to areas that are more remote but given the extraordinary cost of petrol at the moment i would hope that supermarkets that operate differential price policies would recognise that rural communities dont deserve to be penalised
246869 rural areas are being hit hard by higher prices across the board and the recent increase in fuel prices has been particularly damaging for people in sparsely populated areas who have no choice but to use a car
246870 i welcome the recent price cuts that should ease the burden on families in rural communities but i dont see why those in rural areas shouldnt receive the full benefit
246871 if the government agreed to liberal democrat calls for a rural rebate on fuel duty this wouldnt be an issue as it would take out a lot of the extra costs that fuel retailers face in rural areas and hence reduce the gap in prices at the pump but at the moment labour seem more interested in internal squabbling then in helping ordinary people

246885 waiting in the room and knowing hes going to get it
246886 nobody at head start told me i couldnt do something they instilled the idea of possibility in me
246887 head start gave me a foundation and understanding that i was not limited by my situation because of it i didnt know i was underprivileged until i was no longer underprivileged in many ways it leveled the playing field
246888 i wanted to do something like this for a really long time since i was a younger dude but i think that it was the perfect opportunity for me to do it just because nevermore had some off time and basically its something different its something that i never had the chance to do before and i think that theres going to be future records with me doing something like this just because im a fan of this kind of music instrumental music there will be more records like this one that ill put out in the future but now im just glad that i had the opportunity to show another side of myself rather than nevermore this time
246889 oh yeah that was definitely the hardest part you know i mean basically like you said before my guitar is replacing the vocalist so its hard to keep the listener excited really with instrumental music you have to keep ahead of yourself when it comes to stuff like that so i really tried to focus a lot on playing a lot more emotional than i really would have in nevermore a lot of the nevermore stuff i just play it with like fire and energy all the time you know what i mean fast playing all the time but in this record i really tried to focus more on playing an emotional side to try to capture elements of like vocal structures with the guitar i basically wrote all the music first then i came up with the lead composition and then i came up with the title
246890 i think that people have to realize too that nevermore has been together for quite some time you know and i think it was just good for us to get away from one another and maybe do something on our own warrel dane vocals always wanted to do a solo record too something totally different unlike nevermore its healthy for the band to maybe stay apart for a while and just do something on our own and then we get back together and make things crush again its just a healthy move i think it shouldnt be nevermore the whole time
246891 i dont know thats very hard to say because i only really have half of it written but i think that each of our records our songwriting gets better and better and i think that just happens because of the maturity of us getting better as musicians and better songwriters so i think that with the next record it is just gonna be a classic you know crushing nevermore record with lots of elements of thrash lots of elements of heavy metal just our style but with better songwriting i just can only guarantee you that its going to be our heaviest records weve ever put out i cant wait to get back into the studio to start recording we are probably going to be in the studio sometime in early fall
246892 i dont know yet to be honest with you i wish i could answer that question its just kind of too far for us to know at this point in time it could probably be andy sneap again it will depend on timing because he is like one of the most sought after producers right now you know all bands want to work with him so its really a matter of timing and if he has the time to do it now i dont know but i dont see i cant tell you with who we are going to work with yet i dont know
246893 we actually are going to be playing a few other shows one in seattle here next week as a four piece but we have to find another guitar player and we have to have luck in doing so the thing is that we have bud luck with that we are like cursed laugh i dont know how to deal with this man but we hopefully will find somebody soon and thats all i can really say we are not auditioning anybody at the moment we are probably going to record the next album as a four piece weve done some of our best albums like that like dead heart in a dead world 2000 and yeah lets see what happens we will find somebody eventually

246906 but there are others who intentionally adulterate their product to enhance potency or effectiveness of herbal remedies obviously from a public health perspective this is something people should be concerned about
246907 unfortunately this is a situation health canada has not been able to deal with up until now
246908 because of the tainted products that have been coming in from china dog food toothpaste toys and herbal products like this the government brought in bill c 51 the purpose is to give health canada some teeth
246909 stick to products that are made in north america and youre not going to have this problem
246910 im not suggesting that all chinese products are bad but the chances are increased
246911 it claimed to be all natural this being herbal they claimed no addictions or anything like that

246931 i estimate about 12 15 miles round trip if we do the whole belle isle loop we will probably go down john r to the ball park could detour to campus martius then south on woodward to lafayette then up gratiot to antiem then over to east lafayette and across e grand blvd to the island on the way back we can either do a loop downtown or come back by the coleman a young community center and towards st aubin through to the eastern market via wilkins or one of the other through streets if it is too far for some folks we dont have to go all the way around belle isle there is a road that goes through the middle that would cut out about 2 miles and we could avoid little scenic detours also if people are interested we could go through the elmwood cemetary on the way back which is woodsy and green but adds a mile time wise this could take about 1 5 to 2 hours depending ping i sometimes do the ride in 45 minutes to an hour there is a drinking fountain on the island by the casino berts marketplace usually has some interesting live music outside on market day i hope it isnt rainy or steamy

246934 this is a huge win for medical marijuana patients not only in california but across the country
246935 this ruling makes clear the ability of states to pass medical marijuana laws with an expectation that those laws will be upheld by local and state if not federal officials

246938 with two appellate court decisions clearly stating that federal law should not be an excuse to avoid enforcing state law it is now time for full implementation in california

247365 among many other serious problems 56 million americans lack adequate access to basic medical care dental care and low cost prescription drugs
247366 the access for all america act would expand the highly successful and cost effective federally qualified health center model to every corner of this country the result would make certain that every man woman and child in this country has access to comprehensive primary care services
247367 access to primary care is an essential part of ensuring that all americans receive the care they need and this legislation is an important part of improving this access community health centers have succeeded in bringing primary care to millions of americans and we should build on this progress

247404 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator

247448 we must first prove to americans that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states
247449 but we must not make the mistake of thinking that our responsibility to meet this challenge will end with that accomplishment
247450 we need immigration reform that will secure our borders and punish employers who exploit immigrant labor reform that finally brings the 12 million people who are here illegally out of the shadows by requiring them to take steps to become legal citizens
247451 we must assert our values and reconcile our principles as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws

247468 i appreciate waiting can be hard and patience is invariably in short supply
247469 but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season
247470 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
247471 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
247472 we have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to kirkby or the sale of current players
247473 indeed any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
247474 david and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign

247491 when you look deeper though you can see that this trade isnt quite that special for the yankees although the price was right and it wasnt that bad for the tigers who wont miss rodriguez and who desperately needed bullpen help consider that rodriguez and molina are very similar players in type excellent defensive catchers with little speed middling power and a tendency to swing at everything molina hasnt hit lefties very well this year but he has a fair track record of doing so 268 311 405 career and over 300 with good power since 2004 it is a skill he possesses and in a platoon role would be acceptable pudge has produced nine runs above replacement this season in 328 pas molina five runs below in 218 over the last two months the offensive upgrade for the yankees wont be worth more than that 14 run gap and with the defense a wash this trade is a one win upgrade not nearly enough to get excited about rodriguez makes the no 8 spot in the lineup a little better especially against righties but the idea that adding him is a coup is misguided largely because he has a reputation and molina doesnt the skill sets are similar the yankees didnt really need a guy like pudge
247492 gonzalez is a spare part that doesnt project to be a big league regular maybe nunez will be just a middle reliever and maybe he wont reach the big leagues at all but he certainly has a higher ceiling than gonzalez

247592 dada la importancia de la lectura en el desarrollo del individuo y por tanto de la sociedad la adquisici n del h bito lector debe ser un objetivo prioritario y una responsabilidad educativa social y familiar que no debe dejarse en manos s lo del sistema educativo

247609 developments will take place within the current context of decentralisation decarbonisation and globalisation
247610 whether companies are developing solar wind advanced biofuels or any of a number of emerging clean energy technologies the combination of global economics investor interest and a forthcoming pro green turn by uncle sam makes it hard to argue a long run bear case against green stocks of course that sort of superoptimism is itself a prerequisite for a bubble
247611 rather than one megabubble a more likely scenario is that a bunch of minibubbles in various subsectors would constantly percolate bubble and pop thats certainly been the pattern so far
247612 obsolete accounting methods used by traders asset managers and security analysts keep their minds hypnotized by the indicators of the dying fossil fueled industrial era
247613 wind power which added 35 of newly installed electricity in the us in 2007 solar growing at 35 per year geothermal which is gearing up to power millions of homes in the us are overlooked and have been largely ignored by mainstream financial media
247614 eventually of course all the hype and investor enthusiasm will bid shares to crazy levels and there will be a nasty shakeout but were not there yet not even close
247615 were still in the very very early stages of the game is there a bubble there isnt if valuations in some publicly traded sectors are out of whack i think its a function of the fact there are too few opportunities for investors and theres too much demand and appetite for exposure to these technologies
247616 advanced biofuels are starting to recover solar is on its way down the companies are still trading at 100 to 200 times earnings per share

247647 an educated highly trained workforce is necessary in this competitive global economy this legislation will help put college within the reach of more americans by addressing rising tuition costs and investing in student programs many of which are vital to the continued success of women students
247648 we are particularly pleased that the legislation includes the mink program because women are still underrepresented among full time tenure track faculty

247738 uitgangspunt is dat rechercheurs alles wat mogelijk is moeten doen om jouw leven te beschermen daarin gaan ze echt heel ver
247739 ook een jaar in een hotel in een mooie grote stad is eigenlijk niet leuk zeker niet als je je realiseert dat je niet zomaar terugkunt als er bijvoorbeeld iets met je geliefden is gebeurd
247740 regelmatig telefonisch contact of e mailverkeer met familie en vrienden is traceerbaar en dus verboden rechercheurs van getuigenbescherming hebben het recht je computer te bekijken of je telefoon na te trekken in het uiterste geval kunnen ze je uit het programma gooien als je je niet aan de afspraken houdt
247741 de deal was al gemaakt maar verder was nergens over nagedacht er was niet eens een beschermingsprogramma het was improviseren met de prittstift en de plaksnor
247742 de tijd dat elke officier van justitie kon doen wat hij uitdacht is voorbij
247743 burgers een nieuwe identiteit bezorgen is een nogal moeizaam proces gebleken dat de nederlandse justitie zich met zeer veel moeite eigen heeft gemaakt van haagse kees moeten de autoriteiten voetstoots hebben aangenomen dat de man daadwerkelijk in levensgevaar verkeerde ik denk dat ze blind hebben getekend uit vrees in opspraak te raken voor het geval de man iets overkwam een officieel getuigenbeschermingsprogramma bestond toen nog niet van een professionele dreigingsanalyse was evenmin sprake die werkwijze wreekte zich pas toen het verhaal van haagse kees niet waar bleek te zijn
247744 die toezegging van justitie was zwaar in strijd met de wet
247745 dat heeft justitie gegarandeerd afgekaart met hirsch ballin de politiek verantwoordelijke minister de tijd dat elke officier van justitie kon doen wat hij uitdacht is voorgoed voorbij
247746 niet alleen omdat identiteitsveranderingen door de uitgebreide protocollen steeds beter voorbereid en begeleid worden ook omdat justitie ze niet meer lukraak aanbiedt als extra surveilleren rond de woning van een getuige of het weglaten van zijn adres in het proces verbaal toereikend zijn zal justitie daarmee volstaan
247747 die al vijf jaar geen schonegrondverklaring kunnen krijgen en dientengevolge hun huizen moeilijk of niet kunnen verkopen
247748 na een reeks nachtdiensten heb ik een paar dagen nodig om weer in mn ritme te komen
247749 bij ruw weer gaan we langzamer alleen bij extreme storm varen we niet we blijven wel eens buiten de haven liggen tot de wind wat afneemt
247750 acht dagen werken dan zes dagen vrij wie heeft dat het hele jaar door vijf uur slaap aantal uren werken dan weer twee uur slaap uurtje gymmen halfuur sauna uurtje op ons eigen zonnedek daarna weer aan het werk een prachtig leven
247751 heerlijk werken als er mensen tekort zijn lopen ze allemaal wat harder in plaats van mensen van andere schepen weg te plukken
247752 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all
247753 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
247754 this bill will provide an important alternative to the way doctors currently get their information about drugs from the drug companies themselves this practice seems to be fraught with conflicts of interest
247755 by providing physicians with thorough independent research on all the drugs available to them we believe we can improve the quality of health care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs in america
247756 many doctors learn about new drugs from drug company salespersons who may not be objective
247757 studies confirm that when unbiased health professionals armed with educational materials provide guidance to doctors they are more likely to purchase the best drug for the patient instead of the best deal for the pharmaceutical company
247758 this legislation a cost effective common sense and practical solution to a serious problem it is exactly the kind of support the federal government should be providing the states
247759 im proud to note that pennsylvania has one of the best and most innovative academic detailing programs in the country with documented and measurable cost savings
247760 for far too long most of the information physicians receive to make prescribing decisions has come from the drug companies marketing reps not independent experts this important legislation will go a long way toward giving doctors another less biased perspective
247761 providing doctors with objective information about prescription drugs allows them to prescribe the most effective treatment to their patients
247762 through this legislation medical professionals will have the option of hearing independent and scientific opinions on a wider range of drugs devices and medical interventions which also has a proven record of lowering health care costs
247763 we need a program like this to counter the pharmaceutical industrys marketing free for all
247764 academic detailing programs already exist in other countries and in several states and theyve been shown to improve care and generate savings
247765 as long time proponents of comparative effectiveness research the blue cross and blue shield association supports this legislation and its goal of making sure doctors have access to objective information about the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs
247766 providing doctors with information based on independent clinical research will help patients get the best treatment and improve safety and affordability of healthcare for everyone
247767 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
247768 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
247769 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
247770 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
247771 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
247772 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
247773 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging that the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
247774 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
247775 most americans probably assume their sunscreen protects them from the harmful rays that cause skin cancer
247776 this isnt about definitions this about action on the ground to help these workers
247777 we are fully on track to be complete with the cost reduction

247844 what is right is a clear sound policy and mandatory training
247845 by far the most dangerous thing we do in law enforcement is the things we do inside the vehicle

247849 our special election wins in il 14 la 06 and ms 01 cost us more than 5 million and they were worth every penny to expand our majority and show that democrats that reflect the values of their districts and run aggressive races could win in red districts
247850 however its important to keep in mind that this november many of our top races are in the most expensive media markets in the country including chicago detroit miami new york city philadelphia and seattle

247853 it is quite amazing and an important step that should allow the development of experimental and therapeutic interventions for this disease

247863 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
247864 just to say how special it is in the whole universe we might be among the few beings that have the chance of seeing something like that
247865 the fact that we have a moon and that the moon passes in front of our sun and that the apparent size of our moon is approximately equal to the apparent size of the sun all these factors combine to create the solar eclipse phenomenon
247866 nature is calling and we have been invited back to the forest to become teachers for a whole new generation of spokecritters

247879 as with any project its great to see the iraqi people taking charge and putting personal effort into the repair and development of their own infrastructure and community
247880 for me the best part of our coalition efforts is being able to work with local people and government to help rebuild iraq while developing lifelong friendships

247891 well be looking at how many people download to phones versus read them in print which idw should find interesting as well as which book gets downloaded the most
247892 this is a great opportunity to show people that there are comics on the phone
247893 i was really trying to go out of my way to be extra sensitive to the fact that i didnt want anything like that bias to come across
247894 people that i have miraculously and anachronistically failed to alienate
247895 with active exploit code available in a common attack tool it is imperative that apple fix this vulnerability

247905 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates but that i think that what people are really concerned about what theyre looking for is fundamental change on the economy things that are going to help their families live out the american dream there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phoney allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families

247927 a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have
247928 i appreciate waiting can be hard and patience is invariably in short supply
247929 but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new premier league season
247930 whilst i can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players i feel it is important to make a few points
247931 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
247932 we have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to kirkby or the sale of current players
247933 indeed any proceeds from outgoing transfers will you can rest assured be added to the existing budget to strengthen our managers hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market
247934 david and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign
247935 i cannot answer that question at the moment i want to analyse the situation after the season
247936 you want to be the best captain and give good advice to your players but sometimes you can make mistakes as well
247937 this season i know what im going to do and i know i am ready to change my way of speaking to the players
247938 we have to win something because the trophies are more important at the end of the season
247939 his eyes have been lit up like a christmas tree with the announcement his father will be joining the organization

247941 eleven stanley cups its amazing its a very elite class
247942 the v foundation supports a cause that is important to the espn family and we are proud to partner with the staples center foundation for a second year
247943 there is no better way to kick off x games 14 than with this great cause and we truly appreciate the participation and support from the action sports community
247944 and they won the championship since then we really wanted to beat them
247945 early in the summer we hadnt been in the gym enough i knew that once we got some practice in wed be ready
247946 we won every game here by 20 points or more prior to the title game every game we got better and better
247947 besides the practice that is open to the fans there are meetings lifting and treatments
247948 sounds boring i know the important thing is that we are here as a team to become better football players and build some chemistry with each other
247949 its 6 00 a m took me three alarms going off and six snooze buttons before i finally woke up
247950 i wanted to get something new for the blog last night but had nothing on my mind
247951 before practice i think im gonna spend about 15 minutes in the ice tub much better than the coffee for the mornings
247952 after practice i put together an event with the redskins charitable foundation i convinced the rest of the tight end group to join me we invited 25 kids from the childrens hospital that could make it out to redskins park we will get a chance to hang out with all the kids for a while hopefully we can at least give them a fun morning before they leave i put together a bunch of duffel bags containing psps games hats autographs and some other cool stuff for them to take back to their rooms i stole the idea from drew brees but i thought it was way cool by the way for all the people buying jerseys shirts and stuff this is where the money is going everyone thought i was lying and taking in some extra cash but dont worry im putting it to good use so thanks for shopping at our store
247953 we are very happy to have him here he is one the of the top batters in major league baseball and he very well could go down as one of the top 10 batters in the history of the game
247954 he is the type of player that gives us the extra power in the lineup that we feel will propel us into the post season
247955 we have a tremendous nucleus of players and with manny in the middle of our lineup we feel we will be playing baseball in october
247956 on days when the pool is really cold the mornings are really dark the practice is really long and it seems like you can do nothing right one thing that really helps is a little perspective
247957 the struggles ive been through seem pretty small in comparison to what this olympian has overcome i am both honored and inspired to be representing the same country as this incredible individual

248085 but now its like a battle of who can build the best sport centre or the best running track or the best football field or whatever

248108 i have an ongoing concern that human sexuality is a euphemism for focusing on male homosexuality without discussing sexuality issues that affect the reality of womens lives for instance the sex trafficking of women and girls female genital mutilation the taking of child brides and the terrible problems for girls who bear children
248109 conversation cannot stop on monday the day after august 3 the conferences last day its got to continue
248110 we widened the spectrum of the debate in his discussion group not limiting ourselves to focus only on homosexuality but also touch on the problem of polygamy one church in my own country is seeing in its area intense sexual activity among our young adults so the whole scope of discussing human sexuality has got to be enlarged
248111 in a hierarchy so male dominated we are still invisible as a woman of color i have to look at elitism classism racism and all the other isms
248112 the ushers primarily young people reported that when it came to begin the bible study discussion about 100 men left the hall while almost no women left the second and more shocking learning when one western woman asked why we had to be segregated by sex to discuss the story the facilitator said the reason was simple there were people among us for whom this room was not a safe place to discuss the abuse of women and children
248113 there were catcalls when we got up to speak someone said mama bishop should be having her babies this time its not an issue that we are here

248133 it was one game last season that we all felt we could have played a little better
248134 you have to keep working at it when every team plays us their best game comes out everyone is either trying to raid our players or coaches or disrupt us any way they can to try and knock us down

248168 this was extremes highest quarterly revenue in over three years
248169 we are raising our estimates based on this higher revenue although we would point out that the june quarter benefited from business pushed out from the march quarter as well as from some deferred revenue conversion
248170 extreme reported surprisingly strong fourth quarter results but we continue to have concerns about the spending environment and the sustainability of growth
248171 we think the results included some slipped deals and some recognition of deferred revenue the company should be commended for its execution but we have concerns that this quarters results may not be sustainable

248219 there are too many unknowns too many variables and given its a black market an understandable lack of evidence to even generalize towards an answer

248230 had done as much as it could to reduce expenses but that it
248231 we depend on businesses like retail and real estate that are going through tough times and so were going through some tough times so were certainly evaluating things
248232 theres no question that the challenging macroeconomic environment in the u s has made it difficult to grow the top line
248233 the delays in purchases reflect economic anxieties far more than they do competitive positioning
248234 they have a client base largely comprised of telecom government and financial services customers and those segments have really slowed buying
248235 macroeconomic issues are the biggest issues a slowing economy and all the banks going out of business
248236 they have high exposure to legacy unix products that enterprises are moving away from
248237 we now enter yet another year where sun is hoping to grow slightly and expand its margins
248238 its been trying to do that the last three or four years so theres less and less investor confidence in the company
248239 most people buy on price they want to buy from the biggest vendors because they will give them the best deal in a down economy its an even harder sell for sun
248240 they have an expectation that their customers want to put it together and figure out how it works
248241 part of the problem is that they they havent done enough to reach out to the right partners to build an out of the box ecosystem of products they think too much about technology and need to think more about how all those pieces will work together
248242 i am prepared to stay here as long as we can
248243 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
248244 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling

248246 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates

248250 desde que partimos de lima el mnibus se desplazaba a excesiva velocidad varios pasajeros optamos por no llamarle la atenci n al chofer confiados en la aparente seguridad que brinda la empresa al parecer este estaba cansado y termin por provocar el terrible choque
248251 seg n el peritaje policial el conductor del mnibus de civa invadi a gran velocidad el otro carril por el que circulaba el mnibus de la empresa huamanga que se dirig a a lima procedente del cusco
248252 el choque se produjo en un tramo sin presencia de obst culos que hayan dificultado la visibilidad del conductor
248253 hay una sensaci n de impotencia y dolor frente a estos accidentes yo no creo que el plan tolerancia cero no haya funcionado sino que no es suficiente se ha mejorado pero aparecen nuevos vicios y taras
248254 se va a sancionar a las empresas que tienen menos choferes que los indicados ya que es muy importante que el conductor descanse
248255 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
248256 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
248257 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
248258 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
248259 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
248260 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
248261 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
248262 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
248263 there has been a lot of people talking on behalf of adebayor but i have never said i would leave the club

248269 we play the first game away we know we are a wanted target and we want to go to the first game with a top level concentration
248270 its the players on the pitch who play the biggest part
248271 steve mcclaren will get his team well organised and make it difficult for us but i still feel the biggest part will be how well we will play and how we will go into the game
248272 it is a tragedy filipinos come over here to work for their families and they are good workers
248273 they must have been sleeping that is the only explanation as to why they couldnt get off the boat i think most of the filipinos stay on the boats
248274 obviously my thoughts go out to the friends and family of those who have died
248275 i am sure the police the fire and rescue service and the appropriate authorities will look very closely at the circumstances surrounding this and i hope we have a speedy understanding of what caused this tragedy

248465 on the basis of the evidence assembled here it seems beyond dispute that grover norquist has formed alliances with prominent islamic radicals who have ties to the saudis and to libya and to palestine islamic jihad and who are now under indictment by u s authorities equally troubling is that the arrests of these individuals and their exposure as agents of terrorism have not resulted in noticeable second thoughts on grovers part or any meaningful effort to dissociate himself from his unsavory friends

248478 we thought it would be fun for both of them

248519 but to allow them to marry to have children that is not right
248520 i dont see how ones private sexual practices affect their ability to be good parents
248521 they can be gay all they want but they shouldnt be allowed to have children
248522 are you afraid that their children will automatically turn out gay if the parents sexuality affects the children then why do most gays have straight parents
248523 why not if they are caring and loving and supportive of the children if they help with the homework and set boundaries etc how is that not being good parents if they are in a loving committed relationship what is wrong with that what about a single mother who brings home a different man every night is she some how a better mother
248524 what about parents who beat their children are addicted to drugs are they somehow better parents because theyre heterosexual
248525 its important i didnt know better until you explained it to me

248542 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
248543 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
248544 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
248545 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
248546 your rise to the governors seat is if anything an illustration of the fallibility of our public officials what lessons do you draw about the imperfection of politicians
248547 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players

248549 in the competition between pcs and macs we outsell apple 30 to 1 but there is no doubt that apple is thriving why because they are good at providing an experience that is narrow but complete while our commitment to choice often comes with some compromises to the end to end experience
248550 today were changing the way we work with hardware vendors to ensure that we can provide complete experiences with absolutely no compromises

248563 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
248564 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
248565 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
248566 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
248567 over the past three decades congress has passed several anti discrimination laws to protect institutional and individual health care providers participating in federal programs hhs has an obligation to enforce these laws and is exploring a number of options

248571 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
248572 at a time when access to health care is at an all time low the idea that the bush administration would be creating more barriers is frankly incredible
248573 you could imagine a group of people with less than honorable intentions seeking to get hired at a family planning clinic with the specific objective of obstructing access under this regulation there is little you could do about it
248574 as soon as you have a definition in one part of federal law it can become the inspiration for the reinterpretation of other statutes
248575 this would essentially simply require people to comply with laws that they have been required to comply with for decades
248576 that does not mean any organization or state cant keep doing exactly what its been doing it means they have to make room for people who have sincere moral or ethical concerns about doing something
248577 health care professionals should not be forced to engage in an action that they see is the taking of a human life federal funds shouldnt be used for that kind of pressure
248578 religious freedom is an important part of the history of this country people who have a religious or moral belief should not be forced to participate in an act they find abhorrent

248586 to take the positive view the vaccines effectiveness in preventing flu could be a lot higher
248587 nobody suggests we stop vaccinating elderly people against the flu
248588 this study doesnt contravene any recommendations for annual vaccination for people in this age group
248589 if we are going to move forward flu vaccine efficacy studies will need to have lab confirmed flu as an outcome

248626 the first time i got to second base with a girl i was listening to
248627 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic
248628 standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players
248629 while you might think gamers purchase fewer movie discs that others we didnt see any significant evidence of that in our results
248630 obviously hes a part of the this is really something thats been out there all along

248636 he was not fit to plan or execute but he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
248637 it is not logical that anyone who knew ubl or visited him or associated with al qaeda had to be a terrorist trained to kill people as your bad media put it
248638 i dont know that id characterize it as a success and i wouldnt call it a trial
248639 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
248640 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids

248644 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
248645 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
248646 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
248647 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
248648 its either made right on this side of the grave or the other
248649 nobody gets by with anything but we do just have to wait on the lord
248650 the suicide is pretty convincing evidence that it was him
248651 but this is good enough for government work its better government work than i had expected at this point
248652 i often wondered what was going and why there were no answers
248653 i just hope they find the real answers and settle this once and for all
248654 i dont think it ever really left the scene here not completely
248655 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
248656 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
248657 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
248658 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
248659 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
248660 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
248661 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
248662 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it

248670 we wanted to bring video games back to the old days when we used to go to the arcades and played with each others games
248671 we wanted to bring that friendly competition back in a social setting

248681 its such a good version and it really deserves better sales i know its getting pirated to hell and back it was up on torrents literally the day it shipped
248682 i certainly have pushed for digital distribution on the title but capcom japan so far has not allowed it
248683 for the record all capcom entertainment developed titles will be distributed extremely widely via digital channels not just steam or direct2drive but more than a dozen partners across more than 100 sites portals for everything we do
248684 ive spent the last year building up that channel and im continuing to add partners even in advance of age of booty motogp neopets dark void and flock shipping

248710 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
248711 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit

248724 digital camera manufacturers are constantly adding new features in efforts to differentiate themselves from their competitors
248725 however in adding new features ease of use becomes critical in maintaining satisfaction as average satisfaction scores are 235 points lower among customers who say their features were difficult to use compared with those customers who say the features were easy to use designing features with the consumer in mind and providing clear and concise instructions can help maintain high satisfaction levels with new features and functions
248726 customers who purchased an extended warranty report significantly higher overall satisfaction scores 768 on average with their cameras compared with owners who did not purchase a warranty 732 on average
248727 the study finds that among features that owners want in their next camera weatherproofing is mentioned most frequently by owners in both the point and shoot 67 and premium point and shoot 68 segments while ultra slim owners desire 4 gb internal memory capacity and dslr owners desire waterproofing 63

248742 f r die ezb versch rft sich ihr dilemma weiter
248743 unsere erste priorit t ist die inflation im zaum zu halten
248744 man kann berlegen ob eine sich abschw chende wirtschaft die inflation herunterzieht aber der punkt ist dass wir verhindern m ssen dass sich die inflationserwartungen ver ndern
248745 wenn sich der lpreis stabilisiert wird die inflation sehr schnell sehr stark zur ckgehen

248755 we are on the verge of seeing some of those results
248756 ultimately we think mobile will be the leading starting point on the web
248757 we have a very good operating model for this business this is a scale business we have that scale and we will take advantage of that scale were focused on execution we have to continue improving our execution execution will continue to be a primary focus of the management team

248780 it really depends on the wholesale market whether rates start to shrink
248781 its still quite volatile and spreads are quite wide funding is still quite constrained there are no clear signs its improving
248782 governments could back themselves into a corner if they create political pressure to cut variable rates
248783 if funding costs have not declined the rational response from a bank would be to cut back on lending which would mean a further contractionary effect for the economy
248784 now that we have a candidate it has definitely helped in our efforts
248785 before you had a lot of people on the sidelines saying let me see who the nominee is and then well talk
248786 there is a greater concern when members of congress are raising the money and of course sen obama is a sitting senator
248787 this being the case its definitely valid to question what the motives are behind these donations and whether such candidates would feel beholden to these companies
248788 we are working together and confident that we will raise the funds necessary to have a successful convention in denver
248789 we are going to continue not raising money from lobbyists even if raising for the host committee
248790 do we have some big donors absolutely but thats not what drives our campaign
248791 thats not to say that we have not received help from a lot of the people in the obama campaign
248792 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 is an indicator of what it takes and obviously what weve brought in the past hasnt been enough so we are conscious of that
248793 these guys will be up for this theyve got a challenge its very clear how significant that challenge is its obvious for all to see but they are excited
248794 they are standing at the foot of the hill and they are waiting to climb theyre just waiting for the whistle
248795 when you lose a couple it puts extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious since the involvement of this group of coaches we have only lost two in a row once in 2004 to the springboks and wallabies
248796 so that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine so it is a very important test
248797 ive got no idea youd have to put that question to him he loves the job and thats part of the territory
248798 you dont enter this industry without anticipating that stuff you go in with your eyes wide open wed much rather be here and feeling that than not

248814 if achtemeiers book reaches that large body of christians looking for a nonfundamentalistic doctrine of scripture it could play a major role in creating a framework for them he comes across as possessing a deep love and respect for the bible and for the lord and eager for people to place their minds and lives beneath its authority he offers us in the end of the doctrine of a covenental scripture given by god to his people for their edification and renewal a dynamic document which can perform this service two thousand years after its completion confronting us with gods word for our situation through the power of the spirit i am highly grateful for this book and recommend it highly to others
248815 the governor did an end run around the labor process and the government code
248816 its not simply flipping a switch and all of the salaries of identified employees go to 1 100 a month
248817 i dont know how were supposed to survive on 6 55 an hour
248818 we have bills to pay rent to pay and survive for our families its not fair
248819 i dont think its any coincidence that a high proportion of paying customers tend to be from the upper reaches of society often with highly powered jobs the dominatrix helps them to fill a vacuum and find a balance in life
248820 it cant be just the boyfriend who wants to do these things can it no it takes two to tango and my hunch is that girls can be just as naughty when theyre shown enough trust and respect
248821 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
248822 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
248823 this is my best friend he had been here for 10 months but he was going back home to the philippines in september his wife is always waiting and is very excited he has five children he is a very good person this man it is very sad
248824 it is a tragedy filipinos come over here to work for their families and they are good workers they must have been sleeping that is the only explanation as to why they couldnt get off the boat
248825 i think most of the filipinos stay on the boats which is dangerous if there is a fire and they are sleeping
248826 it was extremely hot and humid and we used thermal cameras to assist in the search and rescue operation the boat is of steel construction and approximately 90ft in length
248827 there was thick smoke and it was very cramped the breathing apparatus teams were basically being cooked in an oven
248828 just to throw our arms around them and tell them we are here for you
248829 they must be wondering as we all are what has happened it is terrible when a fisherman is lost no matter where or when and fishermen around the whole coast will be feeling for us as we suffer today we are all fishermen and we are a family
248830 there will obviously be an inquiry and there may be lessons to be learned from that

248834 for more than a year we have been privileged to represent dr bruce ivins during the investigation of the anthrax deaths of september and october of 2001
248835 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
248836 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death we ask that the media respect the privacy of his family and allow them to grieve
248837 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
248838 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level

248841 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
248842 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
248843 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
248844 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
248845 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

248850 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
248851 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

248863 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
248864 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
248865 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
248866 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
248867 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
248868 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
248869 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
248870 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

248872 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
248873 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
248874 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
248875 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
248876 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
248877 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
248878 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
248879 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

248881 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

248883 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority

248886 fact that a great many jewish neoconservatives people like independent democrat sen joe lieberman and the crowd at commentary plumped for this war in iraq and now for an even more foolish assault on iran raised the question of divided loyalties
248887 age old anti semitic canards about a jewish conspiracy to control and manipulate government
248888 a man who cannot control his anger and even hatred
248889 when commentary writer jennifer rubin or abe foxman calls me anti semitic theyre wrong
248890 the neocons want americans not to follow the trail of war mongering that leads not to jews but to them

248918 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
248919 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
248920 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
248921 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
248922 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money

248983 governor jeb bush has asked the department of environmental protection to respond to your letter to his office concerning the use of fluoride in drinking water and impurities in hydrofluorosilicic acid which is used to add fluoride to drinking water
248984 our agency has the responsibility to regulate water treatment chemicals such as hydrofluorosilicic acid we require that all water treatment chemicals be certified to be in conformance with astm nsf standard 60 and awwa standard b703 chemicals that meet these standards are deemed safe to be added to treat drinking water within specified limits when fluoride is added to drinking water it is not a toxic or hazardous waste it must meet strict standards it exceeds the food grade standards of the fda
248985 in your letter you mentioned that hydrofluorosilicic acid contains arsenic mercury and lead your probable question is how could this agency approve the use of a product with some impurities and still protect public health we would answer that every material has some very small residue of trace elements often considered impurities and that our mission is to require that the public be protected from levels of impurities that could cause some harm the levels of impurities found in hydrofluorosilicic acid are very low and present no health risk to any consumers who may drink water properly treated with this chemical
248986 specifically we have evaluated the concentrations of six reported impurities found in hydrofluorosilicic acid lead mercury and selenium are normally not present at all iron and iodine are typically reported below levels considered useful as a dietary supplement the amount of phosphorous found is usually insignificant to that amount already added by your water system to your drinking water to combat corrosion silver is typically reported at 0 0004 percent or 4 parts per billion as an impurity the amount in drinking water would be less than 4 parts per septillion so small an amount that no lab could measure it at the usual dosage rate of fluoride treatment for drinking water the same is true for the other chemicals you asked about think of the comparison of one penny to the total national debt to visualize the amount of impurities that may be in drinking water as a result of fluoride treatment
248987 please be assured that we consider our mission to protect drinking water our highest priority we regularly review the additives that drinking water systems use to ensure that only safe chemicals are used
248988 hydrofluorosilicic acid is produced by treating fluorosilicic acid with sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate or sodium chloride alkalinity is adjusted to avoid the release of the fluoride fluorosilicic acid is mainly produced as a byproduct of the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers
248989 a toxic waste added to municipal water is very economical for the phosphate industry they get rid of this waste you drinking it and get paid for it absolutely brilliant
248990 fluoridation is against all principles of modern pharmacology its really obsolete
248991 the nrc report dramatically changed scientific understanding of fluorides health risks
248992 government officials who continue to promote fluoridation must testify under oath as to why they are ignoring the powerful evidence of harm in the nrc report
248993 it is time for the us to recognize that fluoridation has serious risks that far outweigh any minor benefits and unlike many other environmental issues its as easy to end as turning off a valve at the water plant

249035 i hit some great wedge shots today just the basic little chip shots that i expect to get close i spent last week on short game exclusively and i feel like its starting to come around

249038 weve help set this conference up to address the need for continued education in the health industry of al anbar
249039 we met with the physicians and i was struck first by their hospitality and heartened to see that they have very good fundamental training
249040 every physician needs continued education i go to lectures on a regular basis to for my own learning experience
249041 the al anbar medical conference was assembled to gather physicians from within the province and bring their skills and knowledge together to improve health care within the province and all of iraq
249042 this will expose physicians to new trends in medicine and new procedures that they can later get additional training for through the ministry of health
249043 first is infant mortality that is a difficult problem to solve because we lack nurses to provide prenatal care the second is having the medical care to support the population this is particularly true in the western regions
249044 part of the future for the health care of all iraq is an increase in the number of female nurses within the profession
249045 this need is important in obstetrics and gynecology and it is an honorable calling to serve others
249046 i would like to see this continue with even more cooperation with american and european hospitals

249053 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
249054 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
249055 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
249056 in time to launch ranexa in europe in the first part of next year
249057 anybody gone into a whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
249058 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
249059 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
249060 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
249061 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
249062 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
249063 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
249064 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
249065 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
249066 i think theyre making the right move other guys in here need to play and im taking up a spot
249067 this might be a funny place to start but what are your thoughts on the recent trend of american players like josh childress signing with teams overseas for more money when they still have offers to play in the nba
249068 i like that i like that situation i like what those guys are doing theyre taking their destinies into their own hands and saying hey i want to play at a high level of basketball and i want to be compensated in a way that i feel is fair for me so if another team is going to pay me that then i need to move to greece or italy which are beautiful places to do it then i have to do it i like that it sends a message
249069 some nba fans might be a little worried that if the league continues to lose players to europe then the quality might dip a little bit
249070 id rather have the best product we can have but wed have to take away guaranteed contracts and do a whole bunch of stuff to have that happen

249083 desde que comecei a praticar n o consigo deixar me surpreender pela infelicidade dos pacientes e francamente pela forma como s o maltratados
249084 eu disse por que voc est aqui e ele respondeu n o fa o id ia apenas me transferiram
249085 todos est o apressados demais n o acho que os m dicos sejam pessoas m s eles apenas trabalham em um sistema quebrado
249086 os m dicos costumavam ser a nica fonte de informa o sobre problemas de sa de e sobre o que fazer mas agora nosso conhecimento est desmistificado
249087 quando os pacientes chegam com id ias pr concebidas sobre o que devemos fazer eles realmente ficam perturbados quando n o damos ouvidos eu me esfor o para explicar por que fa o o que fa o mas algumas pessoas n o se satisfazem at que fa amos o que elas querem

249092 o modelo de neg cio consiste numa adapta o das usinas de etanol aqui por um custo muito baixo e em vez de produzirem etanol poderiam fazer isobutanol que pode ser vendido com um pr mio em rela o gasolina
249093 descobrimos uma maneira de exportar a car do brasil num formato diferente porque independente de ser etanol ou butanol ele pode ir para a europa e os estados unidos e competir em condi es iguais com o etanol local
249094 em vez de fazer um investimento em uma empresa de etanol esta tecnologia pode beneficiar muitas delas a virgin pode se transformar em uma fornecedora de tecnologia para todos os players do brasil e n o s a operadora de uma usina

249122 its based on this idea that you know exactly what you want to do hit the eject button put the disc in go to multiplayer and start playing your halo match thats the way its always worked that worked super well for the cognoscenti of the console world but the truth is that theres an amazing amount of content that for a lot of people is hard to find
249123 the idea is to move toward this channel metaphor so you can see at a glance the types of things that i can do on my box to make these things much more relevant about me

249129 i think kay hagan is running a great campaign and with 94 days to go shes within striking distance of elizabeth dole
249130 it must have become obvious that kay hagans liberal agenda is failing to catch on with north carolina voters so her washington handlers have hit the panic button and are trying to change the subject with a barrage of negative ads
249131 i dont want to use the phrase but its a publicity stunt to get some excitement around kay hagan
249132 its a very strategic move for the democrats to do this now hagan needs to overcome doles natural fundraising advantage

249243 its time for all government agencies to stop sending people to planned parenthood and recommending planned parenthood
249244 it is time that the american taxpayer spoke up and told their members of congress that planned parenthood does not deserve to be recognized by the government or anybody else
249245 here we have once again the government promoting planned parenthood to that agencys primary audience and that is minority women and children
249246 planned parenthood has been in the news recently for their racist tactics and the fact that they would accept donations specifically to kill black babies through abortion yet here is a government web site sending these same poor black and hispanic women to planned parenthood the nations number one abortion chain

249258 there was never a conversation in which we didnt discuss shareholder value
249259 there was never any doubt about the position of this board at no point did we ever resist microsofts proposal in fact we proactively engaged with them
249260 to this day i cannot understand why they did that
249261 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
249262 id like to see timesheets posted on the internet for the work of the directors as well as the executives of the company
249263 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
249264 we agreed last year that 2008 would be an investment year an we had to improve our financial position considerably in 2009 i want to be very clear the board controlled the process of the microsoft bid we led from the front the 1 priority was to maximize shareholder value that was all we talked about in the 30 odd board meetings we had during that period there was never any doubt to our openness to doing a deal with microsoft nasdaqgs news we never resisted microsofts proposal despite rumors on the contrary during this period we encouraged from microsoft to be even more engaged the result was that they reduced their engagement level and even thought of lowering the bid in an offhand comment to one of our board members they said that there may be a few more dollars on the table it was never communicated formally to the board or came to us in writing and i tell you folks it was hell of a burden to deal with all these offers we were within our targets in first quarter of 208 we were on target in the second quarter of 2008 their performance was astounding
249265 we are not standing still we are investing in mobile in international markets and thats where the growth is there is no other company on the internet that has these assets and leadership in display advertising we are a major player in search second only to google
249266 we have also been rewiring the company in the last 12 months we invested in performance advertising business with right media and blue lithium the fact that we invested in those businesses is helping us in this economy
249267 because as i do you see heavy and dangerous storm of muslim christian tensions menacing the world in which we live
249268 what bounds christians and muslims together is their common belief in the oneness of god and the commitment to love god and to love neighbor
249269 sensed a danger of global proportions if the peace between muslim and christians did not win over
249270 trick christians or force muslim theology on them or even to convert them to islam
249271 to reduce both our religions to an artificial union based on the two commandments
249272 clearly define the christian understanding of god as the trinity
249273 very thankful that the muslim effort to reach a conquest of europe was unsuccessful
249274 a clear statement about what christianity really is and how we can come together to talk with muslims from our unique distinctive biblical standpoint
249275 the centrality of love in christian revelation stems directly from the startling fact that the revelation of god is in christ
249276 so the telling similarity cum difference of islam and christianity can be displayed in the parallel formulae christians believe that jesus is the word of god made human while muslims believe the quran to be the word of god made book
249277 god is the source god is the word god is the breath
249278 god is the father god is the son and god is the holy spirit
249279 that is important for us as christians because when we say that god is love god can be love self giving love only if god is internally self differentiated because otherwise god would end up being the one who loves simply himself

249284 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
249285 now we take it to the court that deals with the law
249286 what i am surprised about is that the decision came down today the last day to file documents in the case
249287 i thought he would at least wait a week to rule
249288 there was a lot of law to look at that the appellate court will not look at
249289 our attorneys were telling us that the other sides filings were not very good
249290 they didnt do a very good job of filing their case and we were pretty sure we would win the case on summary judgment the first time out
249291 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur

249293 dozens of bullas from the period already have been found some of which turned out to be fakes
249294 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
249295 the mechanism to solve the election dispute during or after the election should be separate from the election organizer
249296 otherwise it can be wrong for the principle of justice
249297 the more they work the more they serve the ruling party for example parliamentarians are working to speak for the people in parliament but the parliamentarians are speaking to protect their own party they dont think so much about the people they forget about the peoples concern they work for only their partys benefit

249305 paul merklinger preyed on the goodwill of investors by telling them that they were making an investment that would be good for the environment unfortunately as alleged in our complaint the only environment mr merklinger was improving was his own when he used investor funds to buy luxury automobiles purchase posh offices and decorate his home
249306 we can all be encouraged that were making progress in reducing chronic street homelessness in america and with more resources and better reporting we can continue this trend but we must also recognize that we have a long way to go to find a more lasting solution for those struggling with homelessness every day

249308 people are like stained glass windows they sparkle and shine when the sun is out but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within
249309 our lives are not determined by what happens to us but by how we react to what happens not by what life brings to us but by the attitude we bring to life a positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts events and outcomes it is a catalyst a spark that creates extraordinary results

249311 washington a bipartisan group of 10 senators offered an energy plan friday aimed at producing more domestic oil via offshore drilling reducing energy prices and aiding the troubled economy
249312 senators said the bill also would promote more renewable energy sources and nuclear energy as well as carbon capture techniques to reduce greenhouse gas production through tax and other incentives
249313 the plan will not however include a proposal pushed by senate majority leader harry reid specifically targeting the commodities futures trading commission and oil speculation sen saxby chambliss r ga said it was too controversial and unlikely to pass
249314 the plan is estimated to cost 85 billion but would be offset with
249315 this plan is good for the country good for the economy because you will be saving money
249316 the plan is not expected to be acted on before congress takes is august break scheduled to begin next weekend

249321 im right at the six floor right at the back tip of the building over looking all this
249322 whenever we have people come over to the building for meetings we usually bring them up there so theres a constant stream of traffic to the window
249323 while they were trucking the big concrete pieces from the yard down to the river they had to close off the road about six or seven times a day for about 10 to 15 minutes each time
249324 so there would be times if you were trying to leave the building just at the wrong time you couldnt get out until the concrete thing got past and they re opened the road
249325 traffic sucks noisy otherwise other than that its no big deal
249326 a lot of the workers they take all the parking
249327 well these are university students and they have to basically put up with a parking problem quite a bit
249328 and most of them are here because its walking distance to the university
249329 driving across the 10th ave bridge i saw the view
249330 es una labor muy complicada la que tendremos el domingo cuando nos enfrentemos a bol var sabemos que ellos intentar n desde el primer minuto marcar a su favor pero si nosotros nos mantenemos concentrados durante los noventa minutos no tendremos problemas para salir con un resultado positivo porque no nos olvidemos que la intenci n nuestra es debutar con pie derecho
249331 en mi poca de juvenil en el equipo siempre jugu en ese lugar de manera que si el entrenador as lo define para mi ser a un orgullo ser parte del equipo titular al margen de que no le defraud cuando me toc jugar algunos partidos como titular
249332 the problem is that its often our smartest people leading us into the disasters look at long term capital management
249333 maybe the smart people are just able to work themselves up into positions of power so that if damage gets caused the responsibility will often lie with someone smart
249334 it takes more intelligence to debug code than to write it therefore if you write the most difficult code you can create you are not smart enough to debug it
249335 they were not really smart not as smart as me
249336 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
249337 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows
249338 its always risky to call turns in history but my guess is that this consensus toward free markets is unraveling
249339 just as the gilded age gave way to the progressive era and the new deal gave way to the post war era of big government big business and big labor the current era of free market capitalism seems to be giving way to something else
249340 lets be clear it is not the protectionists of the afl cio or cnn who are primarily to blame for the erosion of public support for trade in the united states as bone headed as they may be
249341 the blame lies squarely with a business community that continues to support republican politicians who refuse to raise the taxes and spend the money necessary to provide the economic safety net for american workers that a free market economy has not and will not provide
249342 but what americans have also come to realize is that the same model is less adept at providing other things that we value highly things like safety fairness economic security and environmental sustainability and more often than not these are goods that can be had only by giving up some of that output and some of that efficiency
249343 phil gramm had a point based on yesterdays report of a modest second quarter growth bounce the former john mccain adviser was right when he said last month that we arent in a recession
249344 this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
249345 provide additional guidance and greater certainty on how companies can use their web sites to provide information to investors in compliance with the federal securities laws particularly with respect to the securities exchange act of 1934
249346 such arrangements typically appeal to people harboring strong doubts about the stability of the international monetary system and who believe they are insulating their wealth from a global collapse by tying it to the value of gold

249357 he added that the recommendation for the creation of a pastoral forum would mean that the diocese would have to choose between its current inclusive
249358 in an interview with the anglican journal bishop matthews who is a former bishop of the diocese of edmonton said the same retrospective moratorium applies
249359 what i said in the hearing was will you please accord to the province of canada the same courtesy that was extended to them at
249360 a bishop in gods holy church is called to be one with the apostles
249361 i think people have realised that there are not going to be any resolutions and some feel frustrated and wanted some kind of definitive statements to take home with them from the are you sure youve actually read the bible category eugene taylor sutton bishop of maryland to be a christian is to follow a living christ who continues to lead us to places where we do not want to go and calling us to love and embrace those whom we would rather be more like us in every way the traditions of the church ground us but we cannot become slaves to tradition if they have caused us to limit the scope of the reach of christ in our day such has been the unfortunate history of the church whenever it has found itself on the wrong side of scientific revelations and on the wrong side of using biblical and theological interpretations that have resulted in the subjugation of people who cry out for justice have we not been here before when the church used holy scripture to justify human slavery of keeping women in their place of persecuting left handed people i m not kidding here this was very common how many times must our children s children have to apologize for the mistakes and oppressions their leaders in the faith have committed in the name of christ
249362 the amount of time left versus the amount of action needed is coming to a predictable impasse i see fatigue in the faces of many bishops i almost wish we could be roman catholics when the popes dies for a couple of days and they would put us in canterbury cathedral and brick up the doors since we dont seem to have that polity heathrow and gatwick will be open for business on sunday
249363 i dont want to say government is sometimes inefficient or doesnt work right but what if someone gets mad at somebody
249364 but that doesnt mean we fold up our shop and say we cant do this kind of work
249365 if it turns out that he was the guy then that is a discussion that people are going to have thats a legitimate question you cant deny that that is a concern

249368 for nearly two years magnus jones has been gathering resources in order to complete his plans of remotely hijacking the minds of every sentient machine in the world
249369 the attack was vicious and cruel not only was she stabbed twice in the neck she was indeed decapitated whilst alive
249370 the brutality and savagery shown by xing xings killers is something i have not come across before and beggars belief
249371 think in terms of the kinds of clearance sales that department stores have
249372 as part of our annual august model year clearance we are leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer our customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting
249373 we have re packaged our incentive spending typically spent on leasing into retail purchase packages to lower monthly payments on select vehicles from the dodge caliber and dodge charger to the chrysler town amp country and jeep liberty with the model year ending on 2008 vehicles the time to buy has never been better
249374 we estimate there are four five or six children under the rubble

249376 has certainly once again dented investor appetite for venezuelan debt
249377 investors remain quite concerned that these nationalizations are a big cash drain on government liquidity
249378 finally and probably the most important reason why investors are worried are private property rights
249379 it considered the sale of banco de venezuela to a venezuelan private investor group with whom certain undertakings were entered into but the sale was not however agreed
249380 thereafter become aware of the interest of the government of venezuela in banco de venezuela and is now in discussions in that connection
249381 several recent political developments in venezuela present an increased risk that the venezuelan government could nationalize or otherwise seek to intervene in the operations of our venezuelan subsidiary which could negatively affect our operations in venezuela
249382 the move really wont impact its santanders bottom line much
249383 no wonder fdi foreign direct investment has basically dried up in recent years
249384 the government is looking to strengthen state owned banks as a way to stimulate slowing credit growth offer more heavily subsidized services to consumers and facilitate payments to social programs and infrastructure projects in the run up to novembers local and regional elections
249385 while grupo santander had long been looking for a buyer for its venezuelan banking unit and an exit strategy there are high doubts over whether they will be adequately compensated

249387 in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized
249388 it just seems to me that anytime anyone questions obama that this person is accused of being a racist as i recall this is how camp obama swiftboated hillary
249389 between obama and the eclipse of the sun in china its all merging into one theme for the morning
249390 series of ads the mccain people have put out have been clumsy filled with errors and looking as old fashioned as their candidate
249391 you simply have a third graders view of race where its all or nothing
249392 88th anniversary of the ratification of the amendment giving the women the right to vote
249393 i think mr d thinks were all racists because he is
249394 but i think youre much more comfortable wallowing in your ignorance about the subject
249395 not deserving arrogant presumptive who does he think he is americans are not used to african americans who make no apologies for competing on traditionally 100 percent white turf and beating you and whatever the field theres always blowback remember when tiger started winning and fuzzy zoeller decided to go over a menu of fried chicken and collard greens
249396 i have met one of the photogs listed on that link jamie provided
249397 read the comments for what is said only way to learn something
249398 jamie you say that about tiger now but the same arguments used against tiger who does he think he is too young arrogant without having won yet overrated where said about him when he first got on the tour you have the gift of hindsight to know that tiger fulfilled his potential
249399 once upon a time they called him inexperienced and arrogant
249400 henry diltz did the photo of crosby stills and nash
249401 if a died in the wool oilman and arch concerservative like tboone can make the argument that drilling is not the answer to energy independence
249402 are you saying that he was picked to speak only because the color of his skin and not for his beliefs or his ability to communicate and inspire
249403 obama was not referring to the mccain campaign but to the inevitable attacks that will be launched by the republican 527s that would have made the basic point that republicans are racist and it stops mccain from getting on national tv and playing the indignation role
249404 i may be wrong but i think there is a winning argument in the drilling issue couched in the unused leases and lack of development of alternatives
249405 ok lets do that we need all options on the table
249406 john kerry picked edwards as his running mate because he was white
249407 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
249408 once tiger won the masters he was subjected to the zoeller vitriol
249409 at first i was shocked to hear that fuzzy zoeller made those unfortunate remarks his attempt at humor was out of bounds and i was disappointed by it but having played golf with fuzzy i know he is a jokester and i have concluded that no personal animosity toward me was intended i know he feels badly about the remarks we all make mistakes and its time to move on
249410 even with her charitable international and senatorial experience you could make a case that being a woman benefitted sen clinton
249411 john kerry picked edwards as his running mate because he was white
249412 no i think he picked him because he needed an attractive southerner to balance the ticket
249413 but far be it for you to recognize anything but the most negative morsel you can find
249414 the development deals a blow to reputation just as the company has started seeing its image improve and criticism diminish as it works to improve benefits and push through its
249415 dr jerome corsi told sean hannity today that he has tapes of barack obama campaigning for his cousin raila odinga in kenya back in 2006 odingas trying to overthrow the us backed government of democratically elected president mwai kibaki so he can institute sharia law fundamentalist merging of religion and state in kenya obama campaigned for odinga as a sitting united states senator where he spoke in front of crowds with his cousin odinga theres a natural train of logic here that could be very damaging for obama in the general election if obamas audience wanted to hear anti american remarks and odinga always obliged these people then obama with odinga at a campaign rally like this as a sitting us senator well
249416 would you put your 68 year old grandfather in charge of your affairs for the next four years
249417 during his speech obama was interrupted by three men who stood up with a banner asking
249418 oh patsi people like you dont need an excuse or rational to hate who you kidding
249419 your kind jamie the ones who explain how tolerant they are but also find a
249420 some democratic 527 should run a series of ads showing how mccain treats the people he supposedly likes
249421 mr democrat just exactly what is it youd like us to do or say in order for you to forgive us
249422 so john mccain is being bashed for his mendacious ad about obama not visiting the troops because he could not bring cameras whoop dee doo the problem is for three days that ad got run on free media dirty politics works and mccain has now shown who will go as far down in the gutter as it takes
249423 that the nothing getting done in the senate is a result of the repugs single minded decision to stall or block any legislation unless and until the offshore legislation is repealed
249424 a mccain campaign ad says that gas prices are high right now because
249425 para isso temas como a quest o nuclear s o pretextos a raz o principal da hostilidade contra o ir por parte dos inimigos nos ltimos 30 anos que querem nos fazer retroceder para depois dizer que nos obrigaram a ceder
249426 mas o povo iraniano vai opor uma forte resist ncia aos inimigos
249427 and just as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
249428 years before when i had ventured even slightly to find out what on earth had happened to dad id always been told youll never know
249429 i have a fifty fifty chance of getting bumped off
249430 he had so much background on what had happened in the middle east he knew about good american values and bad american policies he knew that the us government doesnt always understand the places where it throws its weight around and there he was suddenly on the world stage he didnt necessarily want all that attention but he wanted very much to be at aub
249431 dads appointment as aub president marked the fulfilment of his inherited values and came at a time when the map of the middle east was not only still transforming but crying out in full protest at its constant redrawing over centuries from the input of outsiders with outsiders interests
249432 you see different styles some love to attack some search for common ground
249433 we knew from the beginning it was only going to end up with symbolic gestures
249434 after quietly putting years into fact finding he could get on with his life
249435 i had a migraine the whole time i was writing the anti terrorism act chapter
249436 i had a blanket over my head as i wrote
249437 the war in iraq had started i could see the direct chain of events what was happening in the world and what had happened to my father
249438 some were written one day after the next i knew my father could tell this part of the story better himself
249439 so many aspects of the story are too difficult to talk about
249440 its always good to know that there is more people looking for caylee i mean thats our whole focus to find caylee
249441 ive been saying over and over again pieces are starting to come together
249442 what we want to say to her and to rest of the family is please share the information with us anybody
249443 i know i dont know where caylee is i just met with the detectives this afternoon and they didnt say anything about her having any information that right now would help us locate caylee any quicker
249444 we still feel that the key lies with casey and if she would just open up and just tell us where caylee is this could very well end quickly
249445 casey has given them as much information as she feels comfortable that she can say without jeopardizing the safety of caylee and her family
249446 i dont believe she has hurt her child or been a part of that
249447 she feels like all theyve done is focus on casey casey casey she feels like its been tunnel vision
249448 when i spoke to her today she was so excited about the fbi and speaking with them
249449 well when i get a chance to write a little bit more i should be able to do that within the next little bit because i have some quote rec time
249450 for a variety of competitors including yahoo until of march of 2009
249451 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain had a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
249452 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
249453 i think they is everyone out there who wants to make sure barack obama doesnt become president
249454 i think when barack was using that phraseology he was talking about the larger issue of the challenges he has in this election
249455 you know it is harder to get elected president of the united states if you are black
249456 he was talking about a campaign that thinks they can win the presidency by putting down barack obama the bottom line is the only person that is obsessed with barack obama appears to be john mccain
249457 he is humble he is devoutly christian he loves his family more than anything else in the world he reveres our men and women in uniform and he is as red white and blue as you can possible get
249458 he reveres our men and women in uniform and he is as red white and blue as you can possible get
249459 they are going to try to scare you because i am black
249460 he is humble he is devoutly christian he loves his family more than anything else in the world he reveres our men and women in uniform and he is as red white and blue as you can possible get
249461 i think they is everyone out there who wants to make sure barack obama doesnt become president
249462 i think when barack was using that phraseology he was talking about the larger issue of the challenges he has in this election
249463 you know it is harder to get elected president of the united states if you are black
249464 it is harder to get elected president of the united states if you are black
249465 i dont think he was suggesting that john mccain was racist
249466 doesnt look like the other presidents on the dollar bills
249467 the difference between obama and osama is just a little b

249469 irs informant rules permit a cpa who actually plans and initiates the tax return mistakes to still collect the tax informant reward which in this case could go as high as 10 000 000
249470 if the case goes criminal the tax rat gets even more outraged american taxpayers should demand an immediate end to this irs gone wild program
249471 a finding of fraud in a tax case carries some significant additional implications for penalties fines and jail time in the context of whistleblower claims it also has statute of limitations implications that can make a big difference for the whistleblower
249472 irs informant rules permit a cpa who actually plans and initiates the tax return mistakes to still collect the tax rat reward which can be as high as 10 000 000

249486 it reserves the right to seize for an indefinite period of time laptops taken across the border

249489 you are the christ the son of the living god
249490 oh my dear katie i miss you so much and especially your beer
249491 it is as if most of the rivulets of various ancient religions converged here
249492 when jesus came into the district of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples who do people say that the son of man is
249493 they said some say john the baptist others say elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
249494 simon peter replied you are the christ the son of the living god
249495 these things are written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
249496 blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
249497 i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church
249498 the rock is not just peter but peter in his confessional capacity the point is this jesus had found in peter a real believer and on that foundation he could build his church
249499 well okay since after all you are peter and i have just said that your interpretation of my word is going to have to be authoritative
249500 get behind me satan you are a hindrance to me
249501 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
249502 i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
249503 christianity will be no more my single hand shall destroy the edifice it took twelve apostles to rear
249504 i am abandoned by god and man i will give you half of what i am worth if you will give me six months life then i shall go to hell and you will go with me o christ o jesus christ
249505 i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
249506 from that time jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised
249507 let these words sink into your ears the son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men
249508 i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings becoming like him in his death and so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead
249509 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
249510 jews demand signs and greeks seek wisdom but we preach christ and him crucified
249511 far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
249512 i deny that and i affirm that faith only saveth we may not say that works profit to our salvation for when we have done all we are unprofitable servants and faith only in christs blood saves us

249514 no i ground my faith upon gods word and not upon the church for if the church be a good church the faith of the church must be tried by gods word and not gods word by the church and i say that it is an evil church and not the spouse of christ but the spouse of the devil that alters the lords supper shall i believe this church god forbid

249519 but we trust the name of the lord our god
249520 and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings become like him in his death and so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead
249521 i deny that and i affirm that faith only saveth we may not say that works profit to our salvation for when we have done all we are unprofitable servants and faith only in christs blood saves us

249561 nei confronti della vita c una responsabilit cos enorme che nessuno pu permettersi di giudicare valutare e decidere nel caso del medico chiaro che tutto ci che alimentazione e sostentamento di base del paziente va garantito se si passa allaccanimento erapeutico quello un altro discorso
249562 il caso di eluana non doveva diventare una questione di propaganda politica
249563 eluana per noi morta il 18 gennaio 1992 racconta il padre exit italia in unintervista del 2007 da quel giorno noi non abbiamo pi potuto percepirla da quel giorno eluana non esiste pi come persona esiste solo come vita biologica imposta dai protocolli rianimativi e adesso anche dallordinamento giuridico
249564 in considerazione del lunghissimo intervallo trascorso dallevento traumatico si pu formulare una prognosi negativa quanto a un recupero della vita cognitiva
249565 il parlamento arrivi in questa legislatura ad approvare una legge sul testamento biologico e giunto il momento che il legislatore faccia la sua parte su questo tema cos delicato
249566 lo stesso rispetto e amore per la vita che proclamiamo a gran voce dovrebbe essere uguale nelle diverse situazioni che ci toccano da vicino
249567 scienza e coscienza non possono agire in maniera disgiunta anzi dovrebbero essere parte delletica professionale di ciascuno e sopra tutto di opera nel settore biomedico per mettere la persona umana sempre al centro
249568 c un putiferio intorno a questo caso fabrizia setta neurologa delluniversit di roma la sapienza phd in neurofisiopatologia a bruxelles attualmente lavora proprio a bruxelles dove collabora con un ospedale ed ha uno studio specialistico ma insomma non mi sembra ci sia accanimento terapeutico c soltanto un sondino da alimentazione quindi non ci sono grandi valutazioni scientifiche aggiuntive
249569 in belgio sono molto cauti risponde setta ma in casi molto gravi estremic tutta una tutta una procedura assai lunga che permette leutanasia personalmente non sono favorevole e lo dico chiaramente sono un medico cattolico anche se purtroppo ci sono casi di sofferenza estrema da parte dei parenti e il paziente in molti di questi casi in coma e non sappiamo in quale stato di coscienza
249570 e estremamente difficile il problema che qualunqua sia la valutazione che noi possiamo fare la posizione del cattolico quella del non assumere la posizione di decidere riguardo alla vita umana
249571 s c una coscienza ma forse ancora pi sofferenza per replica la neurologa sia da parte del bambino ad esempio che dei genitori al suo fianco quindi come possiamo permetterci di fare delle valutazioni sono sempre valutazioni parziali incomplete
249572 nei confronti della vita c una responsabilit cos enorme che nessuno pu permettersi di giudicare valutare e decidere nel caso del medico chiaro che tutto ci che
249573 scatta spiega fabrizia setta quando ci sono dei trattamenti farmaceutici in questi casi che vanno al di l dellalimentazione
249574 questa non una valutazione medica comprendo perfettamente lo stato di dolore e di perdita ma questo non cambia la valutazione fino ad ora fatta
249575 il caso di eluana non doveva diventare una questione di propaganda politica
249576 oggi andare a parlare di tutti questi elementi mo to tecnici e sui quali necessario andare a fare un confronto anche con specialisti e dal punto di vista etico non per corretto non questa la strada
249577 la strada quella di affrontare la tematica in commissione e legiferare in tempi rapidi
249578 naturalmente attraverso approfondimenti reali poi secondo me questo un tema cui va risposto secondo coscienza e non dividendosi tra forze politiche
249579 esatto e sbagliato il percorso i percorsi delle leggi etiche sono purtroppo seempre sbagliati perch sono dettati dallemozione e ai singoli casi bisogna arrivare ad un maggiore diverso equilibrio
249580 non si deve arrivare a risposte a queste teematiche tramite sentenza commenta la senatrice perch ogni giudice ed ogni corte ha delle diversit e sensibilit e si verificherebbe una non omogeneit la strada giusta quella di legiferare il parlamento si deve muovere in questo senso
249581 gi nel 1998 quando il governo prodi ha sottoscritto questo accordo si sapeva che era impossibile raggiungere gli obiettivi previsti

249605 we wish to convey our deep concern about the urgent humanitarian crisis at huay nam khao refugee camp in petchabun thailand
249606 we are worried that the thai government will continue to forcibly return hmong refugees back to laos where they face a real and severe threat of being persecuted by the government
249607 we welcome this important u s congressional letter spearheaded by representative dennis cardoza to secretary of state condoleezza rice on the human rights crisis and forced repatriation facing the lao hmong refugees in thailand and laos
249608 hundreds of these hmong refugees face persecution torture and death in laos those returned in recent weeks have been summarily executed jailed have disappeared or have been sent to reeducation camps as political prisoners
249609 the congressional letter is especially timely and important given the horrific forced repatriation of over 1300 hmong political refugees in recent weeks by thai third army soldiers back to the military regime in laos that they fled and that continues to brutally starve kill and persecute them
249610 this congressional letter is an important follow up effort by key members of congress led by representative dennis cardoza who along with rep patrick kennedy and others have recently introduced historic new legislation h res 1273 to seek to stop the repatriation of laotian and hmong refugees from thailand back to the stalinist regime in laos that the hmong people have fled
249611 this congressional letter to secretary rice is right on point forced repatriation of hmong refugees from thailand back to laos must be stopped immediately
249612 there is no excuse for secretary rice and the bush administration to allow this humanitarian tragedy to continue
249613 tragic mountains the hmong the americans and the secret wars for laos
249614 we applaud the letter by congressman cardoza and the twenty members of congress sent today that appeals for increased assistance from the united states and thailand to immediately stop the forced repatriation of hmong refugees from thailand to laos many of the hmong refugees in the camp in ban huay nam khao and nong khai detention center in thailand have relative in the united states their relatives in america and the hmong american community in wisconsin and across the united states is deeply horrified at the recent forced repatriation of over one thousand hmong refugees from thailand back to laos hundreds of the hmong refugees have disappeared or have been tortured and killed in laos others have been sent to reeducation camps that the lao military and secret police administer and where they live in inhumane and brutal conditions often suffering and dying a slow death
249615 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
249616 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
249617 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
249618 everyone is entitled to a fair judge not the judge they want
249619 it mystifies me why the district attorney would fight this

249675 his closing his eyes to the agony that lay behind melvilles decision to record his rage against his reviewers and his fears about the death of his career as a writer
249676 plato and spinoza and goethe and many more belong to this guild of self impostors with a preposterous rabble of muggletonian scots and yankees whose vile brogue still the more bestreaks the stripedness of their greek or german neoplatonical originals
249677 a deep down unutterable mournfulness is in me away ye chattering apes of a sophomorean spinoza and plato who once didst all but delude me that the night was day and pain only a tickle explain this darkness exorcise this devil ye can not tell me not thou inconceivable coxcomb of a goethe that the universe can not spare thee and thy immortality so long as like a hired waiter thou makest thyself generally useful already the universe gets on without thee and could still spare a million more of the same identical kidney corporations have no souls and thy pantheism what was that
249678 has told us quite convincingly why melville should have taken such evidently personal offence at something about goethe and singled him out for such rancorous personal attack from among those philosophers he names
249679 melville was wise not to let a foolish consistency keep him from exploring the subjects and methods he does in these chapters they are among the most interesting in pierre
249680 i stand for the heart to the dogs with the head

249684 parker is also convinced that melville prepared a volume of poems in 1860 that failed to be published if this is so a stretch that had seemed empty of literary strivings was instead a time of new effort and new failure a black hole parker alone has the instruments to detect

249770 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
249771 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
249772 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
249773 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
249774 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
249775 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life

249782 it already has to some extent i go to a church where i can practise the sort of catholicism i believe was intended by vatican ii
249783 it welcomes gays and many of us would see a case for abortion for instance if it involved a young girl who had been raped i see no problem in that
249784 catholicism has always been a moveable feast things come and go and nobody minds were used to change years ago mary sometimes seemed more adored than jesus but these days you hardly hear of her possibly the women priest issue had something to do with that
249785 we raised our kids catholic but they went their own way they dont go to church but do think themselves catholic

249795 i decided to go the indy route to have total control of everything related to my project
249796 the reason for closing the tramway line was the low popularity of the line and the worn out wagons the rehabilitation cost was too high and the tramway and trolleybuses were not beneficial
249797 i rode the tramway since early childhood and i fell in love with it
249798 the tramway is a very comfortable and economic mode of transport
249799 the tramway line in avchala district was always overcrowded so its really absurd to talk about the low popularity of the route
249800 tram lines exist in almost every european capital including paris prague and london i dont know why our officials decided to get rid of it in tbilisi
249801 but i dont really think that they will care about it
249802 by the end of the 90s the tramway transport fell into a deep crisis
249803 four years later both of them were closed the government explained it as a reduction in state subsidized services and partially thats true as the cost of a tram trip was only 10 tetri
249804 apart from the fact that tramway is cheap effective and environmentally clean it also makes city more beautiful the structure of the rails perfectly fits the image of the city

249809 that woman just hates georgia and georgians because 90 percent of her writing is plain lies and spitefully written
249810 i think the article is written under orders i think she writes shes from crimea originally
249811 this is not english psychology an english person would not write like this
249812 england is infested with people from russia who have taken citizenship and made comfortable lives for themselves
249813 i dont thing its that bad she went to a gel 15 hotel and what did she expect you cannot go to a bathroom for that money in england excuse me is it like the english dont have alcoholics and maniacs or fish and chips
249814 maybe the article is a bit tendentious but to tell the truth i could not find blatant lies there the fact that theres a total khachapuromania here that a large part of the population is in poor shape walks around with a frown on their face etc is probably true
249815 theres nothing bad written there its all exotica now well see a huge inflow of tourists
249816 its a pessimist and optimist thing she saw the bad wasnt interested in the good
249817 now ned is on the right track of the racist redneck america i love so much

249823 many web sites also feature a network effect one example is web marketplaces and exchanges in that the value of the marketplace to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market for example ebay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not competitive however as the number of users grows on ebay auctions grow more competitive pushing up the prices of bids on items this makes it more worthwhile to sell on ebay and brings more sellers onto ebay which drives prices down again as this increases supply while bringing more people onto ebay because there are more things being sold that people want essentially as the number of users of ebay grows prices fall and supply increases and more and more people find the site to be useful
249824 ebay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not competitive
249825 with humanity and let them have no reason to complain of us copying the brutal manner of the british army while we are contending for our own liberty we should be very cautious of violating the rights of conscience in others ever considering that god alone is the judge of the hearts of men and to him only in this case are they answerable

249835 well you can blame that on kenny hatfield hes the one that showed me
249836 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
249837 we worked on various set up options for the car i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
249838 we come here off the back of two rather difficult races and our target here has to be to extract the full potential of our package and then try to secure the best possible result fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
