7060007 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7060008 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7060009 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7060010 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7060011 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7060012 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7060013 the one thing the olympics has shown americans is that china has a very well developed and successful infrastructure and its easy to get around

7060047 yo quisiera seguir vinculada a la gimnasia pero no con las personas que en un momento dado han intentado frenar mi carrera deportiva desgraciadamente ahora siguen en activo y yo prefiero hacer cosas que me den m s satisfacciones que trabajar con toda mi alma para que mejore la gimnasia y no ver ning n resultado

7060061 mr rata tata should understand that bengal would not tolerate forcible acquisition of lands and a deathblow to its agriculture and the recent panchayat and municipal poll results in singur and nandigram reflects that
7060062 let industry and agriculture flourish together in singur and i believe that rs 1 500 crores already pumped in by the tatas for its plant here is not a big amount for a rich industrial house like the tatas so they can accommodate the vendors elsewhere
7060063 so the tatas should stick to only 650 acres of land
7060064 and if the tatas decide to do so the small car would roll out smoothly other technicalities can be resolved easily if the main issue is solved
7060065 but why such incentives are being given to only the tatas why not to the other automobile makers why shouldnt the state government have a uniform industrial policy
7060066 if mr ratan tata does not understand the harsh realities then we cannot be blamed

7060069 the sovereign royalty of mary is intimately connected to her sons jesus christ is king since total proper and absolute power belong to him as much in the natural order as in the supernatural the royalty of mary is entire as well it stems from her son the terms queen and lady with reference to the virgin are not metaphors by means of them we designate a true pre eminence and an authentic dignity and power in heaven and on earth as mother of the king mary is truly and properly queen she is the apex of creation and effectively the first entirely human person of the universe almighty god placed her far above all the angels and all the saints and so filled her with every heavenly grace taken from his own divine treasure that she was always free from all stain of sin all beautiful and perfect possessing such a fullness of innocence and holiness to be found nowhere outside of god and which no one but god can comprehend

7060073 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7060074 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7060075 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7060076 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7060077 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7060078 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do

7060080 gt b gt local dems give high marks to biden
7060081 im fired up about this joe biden is who i wanted all along
7060082 hes got the experience the professionalism the foreign policy experience he gives the ticket the balance it needs to succeed and this will unite the party
7060083 i met him when he came to campbell county a couple of years ago and found him warm engaging funny and he knew his stuff
7060084 he is blue collar catholic very pro woman and brings good name recognition
7060085 he has been voted best in congress for making a difference for working families by working mothers media he wrote the violence against women act in the 90s hes written bills to put more police officers on the street and more funding for firefighters all across america
7060086 the combination of these two talented men will certainly produce a winning ticket
7060087 sen biden certainly complements sen obama particularly in area of foreign relations
7060088 sen biden brings other strengths too as an experienced smart funny tenacious and articulate leader as a grassroots campaigner i think this ticket will resonate with voters in this area
7060089 it shows obama understands where he needs help and thats foreign policy
7060090 hell be an excellent campaigner and will provide great support for the ticket ive met and been around joe biden for years hes a smart guy but one downside is he tends to be a little long winded i think thats why hes always on the talk shows
7060091 from a personal standpoint he was my choice and i couldnt be happier
7060092 joe biden is going to relate very well across southern ohio in places like youngstown and the blue collar segments across the state of ohio hell complement the campaign very well im overjoyed
7060093 obamas choice of biden is surprising given the completely inappropriate racial remark made by biden in early 2008
7060094 in describing sen obama biden said that he was the first mainstream african american that is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7060095 i suppose being african american gives obama a free pass to pick someone who has these ridiculous views on race
7060096 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket
7060097 in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7060098 john mccains comprehensive energy reform plan is supported by a broad and bipartisan majority of americans who are tired of struggling with high gas prices and soaring utility bills
7060099 mccain is a real reformer and the only candidate in this race who is ready to lead
7060100 biden helps with swing voters in several key states and brings extraordinary foreign policy defense and economic policy experience
7060101 hell be a great asset in getting legislative initiatives through congress

7060123 its real and its common but it is also treatable
7060124 its time we got away from the mystique and stigma that surrounds mental illness because next month or next year it could be any one of us
7060125 we are trying to get people to think about mental health whether that is telling a family member friend or colleague that you are concerned about how they are feeling or checking in with yourself about your own mental health
7060126 the more we know and understand about mental health the better off we will be as a society
7060127 we have to address the issue and not live in fear and denial mental illness is a disease like any other disease but it still carries with it a certain stigma and that can be very harmful
7060128 when i was approached with the role the producers were unaware of our family history
7060129 however after i read the script i saw that the writers had undertaken extensive research they worked with sane australia to create a very realistic character that i could portray confident that i was reflecting the true nature of the illness
7060130 it was a wonderful opportunity to get the information out there
7060131 to be able to present it through the medium of tv means the public can relate to it in an immediate way so if they see a friend or a family member who is living undiagnosed with these sorts of symptoms or they identify with the character they can go and get help
7060132 there are many different symptoms but because of the fear and anxiety its easy to slip into a state of denial
7060133 people often deny the symptoms or put it down to something else until the condition has progressed beyond a deniable point which can be risky one of the messages we have been trying to convey is that being diagnosed with mental illness is not the end of the world any condition can be significantly improved with medication and the right social support
7060134 often people dont realise until much later on that they actually have a problem
7060135 as i watched britney fall apart i was dismayed at the media calling her trashy and telling her to grow up i recognised the total extremes
7060136 often we want to avoid even thinking about it so we put it down to other things
7060137 there is still an association with mental asylums from victorian days and those old fears come up but there are vastly improved treatments and more support available today than there ever has been
7060138 telling people to pull themselves together is useless because it only makes them feel worse use a phrase that actually starts a discussion rather than stops one such as ive noticed you have had a tough time lately or you dont seem to be enjoying life is there something wrong this actually gives the person the opportunity to talk you can identify how they are feeling and support them in getting the help they need
7060139 my idea of managing is giving the ball to tom seaver and sitting down and watching him work
7060140 maybe we should just hope the republicans win this thing

7060143 this is another big challenge for the team but im confident wesley and our three other players can hold their own even against the russians
7060144 wesley who has five wins and one draw is also right on target for his second straight individual gold medal on board one
7060145 in the first round of the world u 16 there were no upsets on the part of the top seeds except for draw against south africa a however some of the favorites lost board points which are determining the standings russia won turkey c with 3 5 0 5 india won against turkey b with 3 1 azerbaijan also started with a 3 1 victory philipines turkey a georgia armenia slovakia england switzerland a and greece were the sides to score 4 0 wins over their opponents local girl emel kaya had some chances of draw against gm wesley so the highest rated player in the event who moved on from world junior championship in gaziantep to mersin which would have been the greatest upset
7060146 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
7060147 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
7060148 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
7060149 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
7060150 assist persons and organizations who advance the interests of low and moderate income people
7060151 we are organized specifically not to make money but we make money there are no profits we have a staff of 60 people around the country and that eats up our entire profit were not a for profit corporation but we are not a group like a united way
7060152 acorn has a lot of different partner organizations we are a partner but we are separate
7060153 based on my examination of various records and documents i believe the donna edwards for congress committee has received substantial assistance by way of unreported in kind contributions from organizations who profess to have operated independently of the edwards campaign
7060154 responsible for administering and overseeing grants that are awarded and distributed
7060155 by way of example and not limitation the arca foundation contributed 100 000 00 in grants to the league of conservation voters lcv from 2004 2006
7060156 that after having been intimately involved in the award of an arca grant to the lcv donna edwards was appointed to the board of directors of the league of conservation voters
7060157 after receipt of grant money from ms edwards group and her appointment to the lcv board lcv endorsed donna edwards for congress in 2006 and 2008
7060158 lcv and its principals contributed over 15 000 00 to the edwards campaign through its board members employees and the lcv pac
7060159 wade rathke president of elysian fields corporation is also the chief organizer for seiu local 100 founder of acorn and a member of the board of directors of tides center and tides foundation
7060160 donna pharr is the custodian of record for communities voting together the assistant treasurer for acorn anddeputy treasurer for the american institute for social justice and voting foramerica inc both of these organizations received a combined total of 230 000 in grants from arca between 2003 and 2006
7060161 donna pharr is the custodian of record for communities voting together the assistant treasurer for acorn and deputy treasurer for the american institute for social justice and voting for america inc both of these organizations received a combined total of 230 000 in grants from arca between 2003 and 2006
7060162 i learned that citizens services inc qualified to do business in maryland as a foreign corporation and gave a registered agent address of 11 east chase st in baltimore
7060163 in checking to verify the address i learned that there is no record of citizen services inc actually having an office in baltimore
7060164 according to recent records from the maryland state department of taxation and assessments citizens services inc s ability to do business in maryland was forfeited less than 2 months after the 2006 primary

7060179 we all know this is a simple manipulation of the economy
7060180 mercosur is a strategic project but unfortunately brazil and argentina implement non consulted measures for mutual support that only damage mercosur
7060181 distorting measures have been tolerated in the argentine case which hamper and punish smaller economies an example of this is the export taxes
7060182 its a bad instrument of economic policy which only leads to an arbitrary structure of prices and is similar to establishing a set of different exchange rates for exports and imports

7060193 have pushed some americans to what we call the traveling tipping point it s clear that a small number of us may choose to stay home and
7060194 have nowhere to go but up and consumers and airlines in the united states are being dragged along for a very uncomfortable ride
7060195 staying at home for a vacation can be enormously restorative and transformative and fits much much better into a lot of people s schedules and logistics
7060196 back in 1996 it was going to be this brave new world where women were finally going to take control of their stories and to me it is often more a crushing sameness
7060197 stating that in seeking christ they found each other the 147 churches that sixty years ago came together in amsterdam netherlands committed themselves afresh to christ and covenanted with one another in constituting the world council of churches
7060198 it is significant that as we gather sixty years later at the same venue we note that the churches have been faithful to their commitment not only have they stayed together but they have deepened and broadened the fellowship
7060199 today the challenges of seeking visible unity appear to be even stronger but we nevertheless look to the next sixty years with hope and confidence as we are inspired by the spirit of our ecumenical ancestors who made amsterdam 1948 possible
7060200 issues of equality are the business of all christians this is about you and me as much as about others

7060204 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7060205 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7060206 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7060207 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7060208 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7060209 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7060210 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7060211 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7060212 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7060213 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
7060214 there is no way to peace peace is the way
7060215 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7060216 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7060217 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7060218 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7060219 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7060220 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7060221 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7060222 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7060223 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7060224 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7060225 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7060226 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7060227 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7060228 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7060229 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7060230 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7060231 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7060232 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7060233 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7060234 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7060235 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7060236 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7060237 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7060238 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7060239 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7060240 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7060241 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7060242 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7060243 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7060244 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7060245 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7060246 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7060247 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7060248 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7060249 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7060250 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7060251 who are open to doing something on the production side
7060252 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7060253 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7060254 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7060255 if the shock of the lightning sounds instant and compelling to you it s because it was written dead fast and recorded dead fast the shock of the lightning basically is the demo and it has retained its energy and there s a lot to be said for that i think the first time you record something is always the best

7060260 estamos trabajando en esta l nea hay mucho por hacer pero vamos a intentar apretar esta semana porque el club est insistiendo mucho en ello

7060265 no me importa lo que le pase a su rival ya que prefiero centrarme en mi plantilla
7060266 nee zeg dat komt later wel ik ging voor goud in deze wedstrijd dus nu overheerst nog even het gevoel van de teleurstelling
7060267 toch ben ik enorm trots op mijn spelers ze tonen al vele jaren een grote ambitie en toewijding we strijden niet voor niets de laatste jaren steeds mee om de hoofdprijzen bij de grote toernooien
7060268 de baas van de spaanse hockeybond gaat helaas weg dat is een oude wijze man daar kan ik het heel goed mee vinden ik moet maar afwachten wie hem opvolgt als het niet klikt ga ik misschien wel iets anders doe
7060269 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7060270 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7060271 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7060272 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7060273 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7060274 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7060275 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region

7060278 accordingly it will not be necessary for you to appear in court on this matter and we have so advised the court
7060279 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7060280 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7060281 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7060282 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7060283 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7060284 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7060285 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7060286 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7060287 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7060288 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7060289 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7060292 it is still necessary that as civil society we intervene to ensure that ghana gets the best deal in the process
7060293 the interim epa is fraudulent because it goes beyond what it claims to do instead of focusing on trade in goods the agreement actually captures the singapore issues such as procurement trade related issues and intellectual property rights
7060294 more importantly from the point of view of genuine development the lepas are also a framework for expansion into full and comprehensive epas which include commitments that have been rejected and thrown out of the wto such as universal liberalization and deregulation of services and investment rules
7060295 equally such clarification will facilitate linkages and mobilization of strategic constituencies and help sustain the upscaling of the stop epa campaign and its broad range of advocacy and campaign intervention outside and inside the official negotiations

7060299 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7060300 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7060301 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7060302 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7060303 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7060304 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7060305 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7060306 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7060307 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7060308 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7060309 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7060310 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7060311 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7060312 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7060313 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7060314 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7060315 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7060316 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7060317 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7060318 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7060329 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7060330 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7060331 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7060350 the selection of biden as vp seems to cast doubt on the entire premise of the obama campaign which is that experience so much for change thats unfair hes at least as fresh a face as madeleine albright

7060368 was a bipartisan immigration reform proposal that would provide an avenue for 500 000 undocumented farm workers to qualify for permanent residency status through an earned legalization program
7060369 wrong vote out of 15 measured was on an amendment in the comprehensive immigration reform bill that sought to strike a new program to admit 500 000 guest workers per year on h 2c visas in a variety of occupations
7060370 the new visa program lacked sufficient protections for existing wages and benefits the h 2c visa program would allow employers to petition for temporary workers without a requirement that the work be seasonal or truly temporary essentially granting employers the ability to turn long term skilled work into temporary jobs filled with an easily exploitable workforce resulting in lower pay and benefits for all
7060371 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7060372 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share

7060374 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7060375 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7060376 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7060377 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

7060379 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7060380 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7060381 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7060382 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7060383 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7060384 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7060385 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers robert gates warns of strained us russia relations for years after georgia conflict

7060403 n o houve um cr tico mais duro da falta de experi ncia de obama do que joe biden
7060404 biden denunciou a falta de crit rio de obama em pol tica externa e com suas pr prias palavras argumentou que os americanos agora v em que barack obama n o est preparado para ser presidente
7060405 penso que possa estar pronto mas agora neste momento n o acho que esteja a presid ncia n o algo que se pode aprender durante sua oucpa o
7060406 ele o primeiro afro americano capaz de se expressar bem brilhante e um homem preparado
7060407 ele parece um homem sa do de um livro de contos
7060408 apesar dos planos feitos por gambari durante sua visita de se reunir com aung san suu kyi em 20 de agosto ela se negou a encontr lo
7060409 recolher milhares de endere os de e mail e n meros de celular para a campanha de obama
7060410 as formas de entrar em contato com potenciais eleitores maiores s o as chances de maximizar o n mero de votos
7060411 diria que o senador obama chegou onde chegou pelo uso que fez de internet
7060412 if i had an opening i would have hired him on the spot
7060413 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7060414 a record of raising taxes on hard working families voting to fund abortions with tax dollars and voting in favor of strict gun control
7060415 barack obama claims to be the change candidate but after four decades in the u s senate his running mate joe biden personifies washingtons failed status quo
7060416 santa claus actually did exist until he accidentally skipped sharon padgetts house one christmas
7060417 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
7060418 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
7060419 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7060420 its cheaper to take the bus than to drive behind it
7060421 when i look back at where i was in 2001 i never expected to be still running but im happy i continued
7060422 i knew she jamal was very strong and expecting to win i just stayed behind them and then tried to push in the last 300
7060423 i think it gave us a new attitude to come out here and win
7060424 i knew i had to pull out a supreme effort to help our team win and im happy we were able to do that i came to the olympics to win a gold medal and when i saw it was going to happen i was really really excited
7060425 the police told me that some cases are particularly difficult
7060426 they want to identify their loved ones soon so they can go home people are anxious to begin the grieving process
7060427 we dont want more psychologists we want someone to tell us what happened
7060428 woke up trapped between two seats with her seat belt still on
7060429 all around me people were shouting for help with desperate voices but i couldnt move
7060430 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7060431 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7060432 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7060433 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7060434 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favor of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers
7060435 it was a fantastic day for me i was so happy to achieve this performance its not easy to achieve double gold in the olympics
7060436 we discussed the race beforehand but we did not do what we said we would
7060437 we talked about maybe after five laps going faster but we started earlier from the beginning after one lap we changed the plan during the race and im sorry the other ethiopians dont have a medal
7060438 this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7060439 there were many good competitors in todays race but especially bekele
7060440 there is a big gap between us but we think we will train harder and we can narrow the gap one day
7060441 the area is near a very busy part of south east london a large number of bus routes use walworth road and it contains many fast food outlets
7060442 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area around 2 30am to 2 45am or even before that time and may have seen or heard anything suspicious
7060443 im convinced that he will stay robinho has not told me he wont play against valencia he is an important player for us and weve made that clear
7060444 i expected him to make them before i dont think we should over dramatise it all there are more important things for us right now
7060445 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7060446 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7060447 new york is one of my favourite cities i think its a great atmosphere i love the tournament as well the atmosphere is different to all the other grand slams
7060448 there is always a little buzz even in the middle of the points thats the main difference between this tournament and others
7060449 i was strolling through londons red light district the other evening
7060450 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7060451 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7060452 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7060453 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7060454 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7060455 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7060456 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7060457 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7060458 ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top
7060459 because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can
7060460 the greatest breakthrough in civil rights for women in nearly two decades
7060461 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7060462 in arizona the only way to get around the state is by small private jet and i wound up
7060463 to discuss the possibility of naming a democrat or a pro choice republican to the ticket
7060464 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7060465 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7060466 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7060467 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7060468 you guys all got the wrong guy cause this guy is just gonna sit down at the keyboard and write about the state of the world and hey did you know that iran might be working on getting 2 6 kilograms of enriched uranium which id be happy to talk to the president about ive talked to him about many things would you all like to come inside and hear what i shared with him no so go fly to kansas or something
7060469 two of our volunteers were stuffing envelopes and passing the time by testing each other on movie trivia were not in kansas anymore is a line from the wizard of oz they were talking about judy garland tom cruise scarlett johansson it was all in good fun
7060470 while americas honor is at stake around the world the obama campaign and its celebrity candidate persist in gawking at celebrities at a time when brave men and women are dying we question whether americans would want to entrust its proud destiny to barack obama and scarlett johansson
7060471 i havent yet investigated the candidates as to their stand on issues maybe after the world series but i dont like what i am hearing about this obama and actresses is that what he might pick for a vice president or not
7060472 so i want to ask my panelists its gonna be jack reed huh do we like this guy what do you guys think does he put a tingle up your leg a chill down the spine a flutter in the heart a bubble in the blood what do you guys think huh or is he an ache in the head or what i gotta say for me does he quicken the pulse like a tough ward leader does in northeast philly what do you guys think roger ill start with you ok no time left thank you panel stay tuned for countdown
7060473 god having forgiven me for the mere sin of straying during cancer remission tells me that i am ready to begin kissing babies again
7060474 im pleased to see dick from the newspapers that youre better off than you were eight years ago
7060475 i can tell you joe that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it
7060476 i can see my wife and i think shes saying i think he should go out in the private sector
7060477 i would give the benefit of the doubt to ballots coming in from military personnel
7060478 frankly you have a record in the senate thats not very distinguished
7060479 rudy giuliani is probably the most underqualified man since george bush to seek the presidency i mean think about it theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else

7060487 if we give back 400 acres of land to farmers in singur the nano project will have to be scrapped
7060488 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7060489 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade but let me just speak more generally about the issue
7060490 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
7060491 the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground is how do we reduce the number of abortions because the fact is that although weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years abortions have not gone down
7060492 i am in favor for example of limits on late term abortions if there is an exception for the mothers health now from the perspective of those who you know are pro life i think they would consider that inadequate and i respect their views i mean one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue
7060493 in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade
7060494 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
7060495 evil does exist i mean we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil in parents have viciously abused their children and i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that you know we are not going to as individuals be able to erase evil from the world now the one thing that i think is very important for us is to have humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil but you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil and i think one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
7060496 my friends we are facing the transcendent challenge of the 21st century radical islamic extremists if that suicide bombing isnt evil you have to tell me what is and were going to defeat this evil and we face this threat throughout the world its not just in iraq its not just in afghanistan our intelligence people tell us that al qaeda continues to try to establish cells here in the united states of america we must face this challenge and we must totally defeat it
7060497 i love seth godin seth is brilliant seth is my marketing hero i ve got all his books i buy them as soon as i can without regard to the content or the title sorry i m a godin addict

7060515 i felt really good our goal was to come together as a team and for me to run the first leg get our team out there and pass the baton to allyson were happy were excited and were gold medalists i wasnt nervous at all because i knew sanya would run a really strong leg for us she passed the russian and she kept her composure
7060516 its an amazing feeling to win a gold medal it was really touch and go there for a while thankfully sanya ran a great anchor leg and brought us back to win the gold
7060517 allyson gave me a great lead and i was out there to hold it i held them off the best i could but unfortunately the russian girl went by me at the end it was great to see us be able to come back and pull out the win
7060518 we wanted it to end on a high note weve had our ups and downs we came out with a new attitude tonight men and women and it worked out we had confidence in sanya
7060519 i feel pretty good its been a long olympics and i ran a lot of races but we did well i came out and did my job in the relay i had three other great guys to run with and we have the olympic record i wasnt trying to relax at all because our goal was to win the gold and run the best we could thats exactly what we did
7060520 it feels great to win my second gold medal i couldnt be any happier it doesnt get any sweeter than this im overjoyed we definitely went out there to break the world record we still came away with the olympic record and the win so were real pleased with that
7060521 everyone ran a great leg lashawn gave me a comfortable lead and i just tried to open it up even more we have the best 400 runners in the world in the u s and we proved it again tonight its a great combination
7060522 we have four of the top quarter milers in the world we swept the 400 and we swept the 400m hurdles i told neville that all he had to do was run his race this was our first championship with him on a major level my first games with two gold medals a pr and an olympic record you couldnt ask for anything better than that
7060523 i wanted to run well for the u s and we ended it with an olympic record i came into the games with something i wanted to do i did what i came to do its the olympic games you have to show up if you dont show up all year this is the time to do it i showed up and i was victorious
7060524 this is great coming into the relay we all came together and wanted to run as a team we all ran our hardest and ended up getting an olympic record a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting we use that to build on
7060525 this was a great way to finish the olympics it could have been a world record with a close race but we all ran comfortable out there
7060526 i think that theres more to the olympics than just winning medals i think its about friendship working hard and doing your best thats what i came out here to do today
7060527 they ran a tough race today my body didnt respond i went there with one mindset i wanted to stay up with the leaders but i couldnt go i got slower and slower i developed a virus infection in my throat during the race my throat was burning like crazy
7060528 i just didnt have it tonight i have a lot of work to do and i know i need to get stronger i need to figure out how to stay relaxed and stay with the leaders in the most important part of the race
7060529 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
7060530 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
7060531 in that building existed little more than a bunch of
7060532 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7060533 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7060534 there was no significant loss of life in those towers

7060539 hicimos el esfuerzo pero lamentablemente nos falt ofensiva conectamos dos jonrones pero ambos fueron solitarios y al final yuliesky gourriel no pudo conectarle bien a la bola
7060540 as es el b isbol enfrentamos un buen pitcheo y eso determin el partido al final
7060541 esa jugada defini el partido ah fue que se decidi el juego en contra de nosotros
7060542 nosotros vinimos a buscar el oro pero jugamos con dignidad y con el coraz n aunque nos quedamos con la plata
7060543 pienso que demostramos que el b isbol pertenece en los juegos ol mpicos
7060544 espero que la gente que toma las decisiones rectifiquen porque es triste saber que este es el ltimo juego de b isbol ol mpico

7060552 when i joined up four or five weeks ago i thought it would be a breeze but im getting really nervous what have i got myself into
7060553 i woke up perhaps a half hour later with a painful lump on my head from that moment on i was no longer a liberal a believer in the self correcting character of democracy
7060554 i was a radical believing something was fundamentally wrong with this country
7060555 an example of convergent evolution the development of similiar traits in organisms with very different ancestries

7060573 the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
7060574 we had talks on many issues and also on the land issue the talks were cordial and most probably we will be able to arrive at some decision in one or two days
7060575 we have discussed and exchanged views in a cordial manner and we have decided to meet again
7060576 till now we have made a loss of about 5000 crore rupees today every businessman wants to cut down the losses and would like our brothers in the amarnath shrine board to sit with the government authorities to find a solution to it

7060608 facilities in southern california are down more than 10 percent with revenues down to a lesser degree given toll increases that were put into place before the crisis began
7060609 facilities in florida are also showing signs of stress with some facilities exhibiting traffic declines for the first time in more than 10 years facilities in texas appear to be a bright spot with year on year reductions of less than 5 percent which is half of what most other facilities in the northeast midwest southeast and the west are experiencing to date in addition the reductions appear to be impacting standalone facilities the most with june year on year reductions approaching nearly 9 percent while turnpikes expressway systems and bridge systems are showing declines of 7 percent 3 percent and 5 percent respectively
7060610 small but frequent toll increases will likely be necessary over the next several years to maintain credit quality if current conditions persist

7060616 i joined three critique groups at the same time each requiring writing assignments and critiques and each holding their own strength in writing
7060617 all three were brutal to some extent however one was absolutely bloodthirsty in devouring any mistake in grammar spelling or weak plots
7060618 in hindsight i spent roughly 20 to 30 hours a week working all three critique groups over the course of about three years and i have the bruises and scars to prove it yet each provided its own school of instruction and helped get my writing published in magazines anthology books and excerpts in newspapers
7060619 when i first saw a briefing on the predator three years ago i saw one of my mission sets disappear i miss the thrill of flying but hanging around for hours in a plane is a waste of manpower

7060623 uavs success is not due to a single breakthrough but a combination of innovations in several areas
7060624 you may not have the fear of death but all the other fears are still there the fear of the unknown and the fear of failure
7060625 paradoxically as a result of our success the target has become even more decentralized even more diffused and presents a more difficult target no question about that
7060626 its clear that the u s is prepared to use and deploy these weapons in a fairly wide theater
7060627 we have the plans in place to do them globally
7060628 in most cases we need the approval of the host country to do them however there are a few countries where the president has decided that we can whack someone without the approval or knowledge of the host government

7060644 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
7060645 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
7060646 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
7060647 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users
7060648 these companies may be compelled through a legal action to hand over this information to third parties or the government or the companies may lose the data and it can then be misused
7060649 i have been trying to go more natural with things or at least more homemade i am just not comfortable with all the artificial ingredients and preservatives going into my familys bodies i have also found that my grocery bills have gone down and i love cooking my question is this what are a few examples of what you serve for meals mostly lunch and dinner i generally have no idea what to serve for lunch and i know quite a few supper meals but my family gets tired of them being in rotation so often i would love any advice you could give we cant do oamc considering that we have an extremely small freezer

7060657 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7060658 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan

7060663 we are very excited to extend our league wide partnership with sher wood
7060664 our relationship has grown over the past several years and we know that we are continuing with a reliable partner with high quality equipment that keeps our players outfitted as well as any in professional sports more importantly they offer outstanding service to the league our member teams and our players we look forward to growing even more with sher wood into the future
7060665 during the past years the chl and sher wood have worked closely to attain a strong partnership
7060666 sher wood is very proud to be part of the fast moving action of the chl teams my appreciation on behalf of sher wood hockey and my best wishes to the players and team management for their continued success
7060667 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7060668 i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment
7060669 as far as my health goes i do two shows in a row then have a day off
7060670 sometimes after two shows i think well i could do one tomorrow but ill quit while im ahead
7060671 and he looks as if he has had a ski accident because he is all bandaged up with all his wounds but its a miracle he is alive and i do thank god for that
7060672 nobody knows how he managed to live for 11 days but he was saved in the nick of time
7060673 he was very unlucky that a storm blew in and washed out all the tracks
7060674 he couldnt find his way back because it got very dark he had to find a place to sleep in the dark hes had a terrible ordeal
7060675 music and dancing thats just alana thats what she loves
7060676 every track we tried to follow seemed to lead to a dead end
7060677 so i grabbed some bracken and made a bed for the night ruby kept me warm and i kept her warm its most likely she saved my life
7060678 i was shivering violently it was very very cold and it occurred to me that i might not make it but i put that thought out of my mind and told myself i am walking out of here and i am taking ruby with me
7060679 she headed off behind some thick undergrowth when we started walking in the morning
7060680 i kept calling out to her but she was gone
7060681 she saved my life so i wanted to return the favour and save her we just love her
7060682 its been pretty intense everythings worked out but it could have easily gone the other way
7060683 dom was more worried about ruby than himself he wanted to look for her instead of going to the hospital
7060684 if he didnt have the dog with him certainly the outcome could have been substantially more serious in fact who knows how serious the weather up there was well below zero

7060691 the boy was not quite 12 1 2 years old when he got involved in a flare up of gang violence in the area near century high on sept 11 2006 according to evidence presented at two earlier trials in orange county superior court the boy joined two members of the lil mini street gang when they sought revenge for the fatal stabbing earlier that day of oscar gonzalez 14 witnesses testified that five suspected members of an asian gang confronted gonzalez and accused him of crossing out their gang graffiti gonzalez even though he was outnumbered 5 to 1 did not back down he was stabbed to death in the ensuing fight several of his gang member friends including older brother sergio gonzalez 15 apparently saw oscar gonzalez being loaded into an ambulance according to court testimony they then quickly met and plotted revenge three hours after the stabbing incident sergio gonzalez antonio barboza 18 and the 12 year old boy walked together from their neighborhood into territory claimed by the asian gangs according to testimony the threesome came across and surrounded chea who was not involved in the earlier stabbing sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car after a brief exchange of gang taunts sergio gonzalez fired several shots at near point blank range killing chea instantly according to the testimony sergio gonzalez was tried as an adult convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 40 years to life in prison barboza ultimately was also convicted of second degree murder under the aiding and abetting theory and was also sentenced to 40 years to life in prison the 12 year old boy was prosecuted in juvenile court state law does not allow for defendants that young to be prosecuted as adults or face adult punishments such as life in prison
7060692 but the revelation that the attack was related to the case three people including at least one eastsider have been arrested for the attack with charges including attempted murder and witness intimidation has only brightened the spotlight on the potential for intimidation dozer admitted in court that tension was high on the streets as a result of the trial and tensions have been high inside the court as well
7060693 yes but not to attend the party theres a great difference
7060694 stay here katherine were going outside for a short talk okay
7060695 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
7060696 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
7060697 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
7060698 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7060699 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7060700 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7060701 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7060702 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
7060703 dari ibnu abbas sesungguhnya nabi saw shalat di bulan ramadlan dua puluh rakaat hadits riwayat ibnu abi syaibah abdu bin humaid thabrani di kitabnya kabir dan ausath baihaqi amp ibnu adi dan lain lain
7060704 dari yazid bin ruman ia berkata adalah manusia pada zaman umar bin khattab mereka shalat tarawih di bulan ramadlan dua puluh tiga rakaat
7060705 dari imam malik dari muhammad bin yusuf dari saib bin yazid ia berkata
7060706 i dont think its gonna be a two man chase honestly
7060707 well know with about three or four races to go thats the only time youre gonna know whos gonna be in this thing
7060708 he started out the year really strong he was good at california he was really good at vegas hes always been there we knew that we were going to have our work cut out with him
7060709 rivalries are good theyre fun but its still too far out we dont know exactly how this is all gonna go
7060710 me personally my rival every week is the person thats in front of me theres not enough time to focus on one guy because youve got to worry about everyone else so well see what happens
7060711 will edwards and busch make the chase a two horse race
7060712 i personally think he should be one of the 50 greatest drivers because of what hes done
7060713 hes just been solid he did a lot for the sport and hes a hard racer he races every lap in practice or qualifying he drives as hard as anybody ive ever watched drive thats what attracted me to him is watching how hard he drove a race car
7060714 the sport means a lot to him but if you ask him about himself he will downplay the role he has played in taking our sport to what it is
7060715 jeff is obviously a leader in our sport that has taken it to the level that it is from a safety standpoint from a spokesman from everything that comes with the sport i dont necessarily know that you can rank anybody in this sport i am sure everybody has their opinion but he is definitely a big part of our sport and why it is what it is today in his own way
7060716 we had a real competitive car and just kind of kept ourselves in position
7060717 the track is going to probably have less grip than it did when we were here then weve got to adapt to that but this has been one of our stronger race tracks really and hopefully we can continue to do that
7060718 weve been kind of playing catch up on that the whole time i dont think weve fallen further behind some days i think were caught up and other days i think we havent we just havent performed at that level where you can go out and win four or five races a year thats not to say that were not going to but we just havent done it to this point
7060719 if you watch the racing today versus the way it was 15 years ago theres no comparison
7060720 thats just how it is it doesnt surprise me that things are as close as they are because the teams are so competitive thats what one of the fears about multicar teams was they were going to take competition away from the sport its actually increased competition because jack roush has five really good teams joe gibbs has three really good teams rick hendrick has four really good teams that makes the racing more competitive and it shows up in the points
7060721 i think it creates excitement as in any playoff type system you can always say well that team won 20 games and they should have won whatever and they didnt because they lost in the first round of playoffs its about being right at the right time of year
7060722 five men and a juvenile are facing criminal charges in connection with an attack that sent both a guadalupe police officer and a 20 year old police explorer scout to the hospital earlier this month

7060725 adapun isapan istri terhadap kemaluan suaminya oral sex maka ini adalah haram tidak dibolehkan karena ia kemaluan suami dapat memencar kalau memencar maka akan keluar darinya air madzy yang dia najis menurut kesepakatan ulama apabila air madzy itu masuk ke dalam mulutnya lalu ke perutnya maka boleh jadi akan menyebabkan penyakit baginya dan syaikh ibnu baz rahimahullah telah berfatwa tentang haramnya hal tersebut sebagaimana yang saya dengarkan langsung dari beliau
7060726 apakah boleh seorang perempuan mencumbu batang kemaluan penis suaminya dengan mulutnya dan seorang lelaki sebaliknya
7060727 ini adalah perbuatan sebagian binatang seperti anjing dan kita punya dasar umum bahwa dalam banyak hadits ar rasul melarang untuk tasyabbuh menyerupai hewan hewan seperti larangan beliau turun sujud seperti turunnya onta dan menoleh seperti tolehan srigala dan mematuk seperti patukan burung gagak dan telah dimaklumi pula bahwa nabi shallallahu alahi wa sallam telah melarang untuk tasyabbuh dengan orang kafir maka diambil juga dari makna larangan tersebut pelarangan tasyabbuh dengan hewan hewan sebagai penguat yang telah lalu apalagi hewan yang telah dlketahui kejelekan tabiatnya maka seharusnya seorang muslim dan keadaannya seperti ini merasa tinggi untuk menyerupai hewan hewan
7060728 ini adalah haram karena ia termasuk tasyabbuh dengan hewan hewan namun banyak di kalangan kaum muslimin yang tertimpa oleh perkara perkara yang rendah lagi ganjil menurut syariat akal dan fitrah seperti ini hal tersebut karena ia menghabiskan waktunya untuk mengikuti rangkaian film film porno melalui video atau televisi yang rusak seorang lelaki muslim berkewajiban untuk menghormati istrinya dan jangan ia berhubungan dengannya kecuali sesuai dengan perintah allah kalau ia berhubungan dengannya selain dari tempat yang allah halalkan baginya maka tergolong melampaui batas dan bermaksiat kepada allah dan rasul nya shallallahu alahi wa sallam

7060738 aku melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menunjukkan kepadaku dengan kelingkingnya apa yang ada diantara jari jari kedua kakinya
7060739 sesungguhnya hadist ini adalah hasan aku mendengarnya hanya satu jam kemudian aku mendengarnya setelah itu ditanya lalu ia memerintahkan untuk menyelang nyelangi jari jari mukaddimah al jarhu wat tadil karya ibnu abi hatim hal 32 33

7060741 kaum muslimin telah sepakat bahwa barang siapa yang telah terang baginya sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka tidak halal baginya untuk meninggalkannya karena untuk mengikuti perkataan seseorang
7060742 apabila kamu mendapatkan di dalam kitabku apa yang bertentangan dengan sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka berkatalah dengan sunnah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam dan tinggalkanlah apa yang aku katakan

7060745 apabila kamu melihat aku mengatakan suatu perkataan sedangkan hadist nabi yang bertentangan dengannya shahih maka ketahuilah sesungguhnya akalku telah bermadzhab dengannya
7060746 janganlah engkau mengikuti aku dan jangan pula engkau mengikuti malik syafii auzai dan tsauri tapi ambillah dari mana mereka mengambil
7060747 pendapat auzai pendapat malik dan pendapat abu hanifah semuanya adalah pendapat dan ia bagiku adalah sama sedangkan alasan hanyalah terdapat di dalam atsar atsar
7060748 barang siapa yang menolak hadits rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam maka sesungguhnya ia telah berada di tepi kehancuran
7060749 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa dalam hati mereka sesuatu keberatan terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
7060750 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyalahi perintah nya takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa adzab yang pedih
7060751 adalah menjadi kewajiban bagi setiap orang yang telah sampai kepadanya perintah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam dan mengetahuinya untuk menerangkannya kepada umat menasehati mereka dan memerintahkan kepada mereka untuk mengikuti perintahnya dan apabila hal itu bertentangan dengan pendapat orang besar diantara umat maka sesungguhnya perintah rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam itu lebih berhak untuk disebarkan dan diikuti dibanding pendapat orang besar manapun yang telah bertentangan dengan perintahnya di dalam sebagian perkara secara salah dan dari sini para sahabat dan orang orang setelah mereka telah menolak setiap orang yang menentang sunnah yang sahih dan barangkali mereka telah berlaku keras dalam penolakan ini namun demikian mereka tidak membencinya bahkan dia dicintai dan diagungkan di dalam hati mereka akan tetapi rasulullah salallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah lebih dicintai oleh mereka dan perintahnya melebihi setiap makhluk lainnya oleh karena itu apabila perintah rasul itu bertentangan dengan perintah selainnya maka perintah rasul adalah lebih utama untuk didahulukan dan diikuti hal ini tidak dihalang halangi oleh pengagungan terhadap orang yang bertentangan dengan perintahnya walaupun orang itu mendapat ampunan orang yang bertentangan itu tidak membenci apabila perintahnya itu diingkari apabila memang ternyata perintah rasulullah itu bertentangan dengannya bagaimana mungkin mereka akan membenci hal itu sedangkan mereka telah memerintahkan kepada para pengikutnya dan mereka telah mewajibkan mereka untuk meninggalkan perkataan perkataan yang bertentangan dengan sunnah

7060921 we have lost him for quite some time now and he has not had a great deal of football recently either which is a concern for us
7060922 you do hope that while they are away that they will get good game time under his belt
7060923 he has been in competitive games but going in for 10 15 minutes a time is not the ideal preparation for premier league games so it might take a little bit of time to get up to speed

7060933 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well
7060934 it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7060935 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7060936 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race

7060945 you fellows would call the end of the world a good evening look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river i tell you that if that were literally human blood spilt and shining you would still be standing here as solid as ever looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on you policemen are cruel to the poor but i could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm
7060946 the soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle
7060947 the composure of an army is the anger of a nation
7060948 i never had any of those advantages the board schools came after my time what education i had was very rough and old fashioned i am afraid
7060949 for much the same reason that you abused the police
7060950 i found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable though excessive outbreaks of the human will i trust i make myself clear
7060951 i suppose you do but as for making yourself clear it is the last thing you do how comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the thames embankment
7060952 you have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system
7060953 i am not surprised at it we are keeping it rather dark from the educated class because that class contains most of our enemies but you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind i think you might almost join us
7060954 this is the situation the head of one of our departments one of the most celebrated detectives in europe has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation he is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the family and the state he has therefore formed a special corps of policemen policemen who are also philosophers it is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense i am a democrat myself and i am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue but it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt
7060955 is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective the ordinary detective goes to pot houses to arrest thieves we go to artistic tea parties to detect pessimists the ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed we discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed we have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime we were only just in time to prevent the assassination at hartle pool and that was entirely due to the fact that our mr wilks a smart young fellow thoroughly understood a triolet
7060956 that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that
7060957 but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business i tell you i am sometimes sick of my trade when i see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate but this new movement of ours is a very different affair we deny the snobbish english assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals we remember the roman emperors we remember the great poisoning princes of the renaissance we say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal we say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher compared to him burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men my heart goes out to them they accept the essential ideal of man they merely seek it wrongly thieves respect property they merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it but philosophers dislike property as property they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession bigamists respect marriage or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy but philosophers despise marriage as marriage murderers respect human life they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives but philosophers hate life itself their own as much as other peoples
7060958 i have felt it from my boyhood but never could state the verbal antithesis the common criminal is a bad man but at least he is as it were a conditional good man he says that if only a certain obstacle be removed say a wealthy uncle he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise god he is a reformer but not an anarchist he wishes to cleanse the edifice but not to destroy it but the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things but to annihilate them yes the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious the harrying of the poor the spying upon the unfortunate it has given up its more dignified work the punishment of powerful traitors the in the state and powerful heresiarchs in the church the moderns say we must not punish heretics my only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else
7060959 but it is intolerable i dont know what youre doing but youre wasting your life you must you shall join our special army against anarchy their armies are on our frontiers their bolt is ready to fall a moment more and you may lose the glory of working with us perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world
7060960 but still i do not quite understand i know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements but beastly as they are they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other how can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt what is this anarchy
7060961 with those chance dynamite outbreaks from russia or from ireland which are really the outbreaks of oppressed if mistaken men this is a vast philosophic movement consisting of an outer and an inner ring you might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood i prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section the inner ring the supremely guilty section the outer ring the main mass of their supporters are merely anarchists that is men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness they believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime they do not believe that the crime creates the punishment they believe that the punishment has created the crime they believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring they believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good these i call the innocent section
7060962 naturally therefore these people talk about a happy time coming the paradise of the future mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue and so on and so also the men of the inner circle speak the sacred priesthood they also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future and of mankind freed at last but in their mouths
7060963 in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning they are under no illusions they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle and they mean death when they say that mankind shall be free at last they mean that mankind shall commit suicide when they talk of a paradise without right or wrong they mean the grave they have but two objects to destroy first humanity and then themselves that is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols the innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king but the high priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody
7060964 i know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment
7060965 as i have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom i have spoken you should really come and see him or rather i should not say see him nobody ever sees him but you can talk to him if you like
7060966 he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch dark room he says it makes his thoughts brighter do come along
7060967 i dont know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test
7060968 the situation is very serious i can tell you i have commitments to export 30 million rupees 392 000 of rice this month to uae
7060969 i just cant do it because no truck is available to carry the rice from the warehouse to the port
7060970 we will continue our strike until the demands are met it is difficult to bear the expenses its impossible
7060971 we have asked them tata motors that if you are facing problems over there in singur we are ready to give you red carpet welcome moreover we have right to say this as they are from this place we have told them earlier as well to come here to set up their plant
7060972 we will see if they approach us as you have seen our state government always welcomes industry which will bring revenues to our state and jobs for our young people we always welcome industry and good investment in our state
7060973 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7060974 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7060975 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7060976 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7060977 the second quarter gdp data will be revised higher because of the trade numbers but the market will be looking more closely at some of the more forward looking data to see what will happen next what is the extent of the economic slowdown going forward

7060988 i am deeply saddened by this pathetic inability to accept that art is inextricably linked to change unfortunately one of italys problems is that power in politics music and otherwise is always firmly in the hands of old people who ignore everything that has been accomplished by younger talents i find this gross lack of generosity and humanity simply pitiful these artists have received everything from music but i want to reassure them well go ahead following our path knowing very well that after us new people will come with ideas thatwill innovate even more
7060989 im appalled their ideas arent even conservative theyre reactionary and provincial
7060990 maestro maazel says hes escaping from salzburg he hasnt been invited to conduct here since 2001
7060991 apparently zeffirelli and maazel are confused the fact that they dont like certain things doesnt change the fact that the resume of the directors they dont like is unimpeachable its not wise to innovate at all cost for the sake of innovation but the theater to survive needs to be open to new ideas and experimentation and freedom it cant become a cult

7060996 i spent a lifetime in salzburg my debut there was in 1963 and i conducted there 109 times in all between operas and concerts now ive had enough enough with weirdly provocative stagings of arrogant directors who think innovation means boring the audience using public funds
7060997 i feel like speaking up for the people who buy tickets and go to the opera and are subjected to the wrongheaded reinterpretations of great operas thats what i told gerard mortier when he ran the festival
7060998 often those directors are simply uneducated like that guy i dont even remember his name who was directing
7060999 i get things done the way i want them because i have a name and a history other conductors simply adapt themselves until one day i blew up disgusted nothing in salzburg was about the music anymore but we should always respect the great composers

7061002 operas are first of all about music but often being based on works of literaure they also do carry a social message
7061003 what mr ramsey writes is contradictory there is no neutrality or absence of ethics in society otherwise there would be no humanity at all there is no life without a message and there is no man without leaving a trace behind him perhaps he should study the words of socrates who always reached to a conclusion of what promotes the good among people so yes there is always a message to reach or else you are completely lost in sentences that end only in question marks

7061061 i am the way and the truth and the life
7061062 but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus

7061078 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas

7061130 a couple of years ago i was thinking beijing is going to be good that if i make the team i will be stoked
7061131 now i am a gold and bronze medallist i am ecstatic i cant wait until i get to london a bit bigger a bit stronger a bit faster hopefully
7061132 i was last at halfway i was first at the 500
7061133 i watched his first race and he had this big mexican sombrero on
7061134 he came down and had to stop four or five times because the sombrero kept falling over his face it was a comedy of errors
7061135 i thought this guy is going to give me grey hairs for sure but im going to love having them we have had a lot of fun a lot of fun
7061136 at my next race i turned up in a business suit telling jimmy im ready for business
7061137 i am not quite sure jimmy knew what he was getting himself into eight years ago
7061138 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7061139 senator biden is a tremendous leader and a great complement to senator obama and his candidacy
7061140 he has worked as a committed public servant has a proven track record and understands the complex challenges facing our nation
7061141 he was too untested on foreign policy issues and too inexperienced and green to fight the terrorism battle and to be hard nosed enough on national security
7061142 we have had a president for nearly eight years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes every day all day
7061143 the corporate media typically forgive bush for this and dont even often bring it up why is it that it is an issue for biden but not for bush
7061144 joe biden is vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom
7061145 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7061146 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7061147 biden brings experience feistiness and boatloads of foreign policy seasoning that obama sorely lacks and biden knows more about sensible foreign policy than mccain tom ridge tim pawlenty or mitt romney will ever know themselves
7061148 picking biden also sends a stark signal that the obama campaign is worried that the presidential nominee is in danger of flunking the commander in chief test
7061149 it is not looking as good it was for obama
7061150 at this point we still expect him to win but it could be a much tighter race

7061158 i get asked a lot about the relationship between old media and new media on the editorial and publishing side and my usual line is that i think the relationship is much more symbiotic and convergent then people often realize but when folks ask what scrappy little outfits like tpm would do if the big papers with their cadres of reporters went under i have wonder what would big papers like the washington post do if tpm went under and they didnt have our exclusives to steal and run as their own stories on a2 on the following day
7061159 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7061160 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again

7061170 it was a bit like watching your children graduate from college
7061171 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7061172 ive looked at every other possible candidate no one brings to a ticket what hillary brings 18 million people committed to where shes going
7061173 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
7061174 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
7061175 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
7061176 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
7061177 cyber cafes have become very cheap but if you have laptop if we sit at home at night it is easy to work
7061178 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree of certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
7061179 our natural environment is the best in the country but while our elite athletes are the envy of the world the rest of us are falling behind
7061180 unlike the biggest loser television show this competition is not just about losing weight it is about encouraging queensland communities to become healthier across the board
7061181 thats why this 1 million government grant will be up for grabs every year for the town that is most successful in turning on a healthy revolution in its community
7061182 for instance diabetes is expected to become the single biggest cause of illness and early death in 15 years leaving thousands of queenslanders with poorer quality of life
7061183 this initiative is about empowering communities to lead by example and tackle chronic disease head on in their own back yard

7061186 we played our best hockey today and this has to be our biggest success ever
7061187 i am so proud of the team the great team spirit we have is what carried us through it cant get better than this
7061188 i am sad because we made the same mistakes again
7061189 when they are leading all they do is defend we tried everything to get a goal but just could not beat their defence
7061190 it took some time coming to grips with the semi final defeat
7061191 we grieved for some time dealt with our emotions and started to refocus
7061192 this is a team with comradeship togetherness and unity and is well placed going into 2010 and beyond
7061193 we may be gone but we need to find players who will be hungry to reach for the top

7061217 the deficiencies we identified were very serious some potentially life threatening

7061276 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7061277 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7061278 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7061279 the best policy for our country on the question of abortion is a policy of government neutrality put another way i do not believe that the government should be involved in making judgments on whether a woman can or should have an abortion or if she chooses to do so in paying for that abortion

7061284 everyone agrees school breakfast increases school attendance student attentiveness and achievement and lowers the risk for childhood obesity
7061285 when i learned that children who eat school breakfast consume more fruits drink more milk and eat less saturated fat than those who dont eat breakfast or eat at home i agreed to introduce a resolution in the city county for a universal school breakfast program in cps the time has come for chicago to move from last to first place in providing breakfast to our kids
7061286 the chicago city council voted unanimously to direct the chicago board of education to provide breakfast to all cps students this study illustrates precisely why we need breakfast for all children in the chicago public schools
7061287 its risky in that its new and has an untested track record
7061288 its logical in that the other choice is to keep on doing whats been tried before and we know what the results of that will be what you try to do if youre chicago is to minimize the risk and maximize the possibility of a good outcome
7061289 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
7061290 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
7061291 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
7061292 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
7061293 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
7061294 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
7061295 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7061296 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
7061297 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
7061298 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
7061299 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
7061300 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
7061301 hmph you were lucky but this time i guess not
7061302 sensei why dont you become a karate master instead of a teacher
7061303 how dare you on your first day to fall asleep in class and even talked back to me i guess you have some guts yoshizawa no one in this school is dare enough to confront me except you
7061304 phew lucky its lunch time even though my karate is beyond a black belt but i wouldnt want to face her wrath dang her glare really scared the shit out of me
7061305 who is this girl ive never seen her before maybe shes a transferred student but shes really handsome and she has pants too
7061306 out of the way cant you see rika sama is here idiot
7061307 erika we have to teach these idiots a lesson not to get in way
7061308 even though you have a pretty face but deep down inside is rotten who do you think you are making everyone to get out of your way
7061309 who am i is none of your business even my father wouldnt dare to lecture me that
7061310 then ill teach you in place of your father i dont give a damn about your father spoiled you but if you bully people then ill stick my nose in it
7061311 really next time you should stand up against them bullies are coward once you fight against them
7061312 its ok im used to it she has a strong father behind no one dares to slap her like that
7061313 thats why you didnt know about rikas strong background avoid her next time when you see her im going back to my classroom thank you for saving me and im sorry for putting you in danger she might not leave you alone
7061314 dont worry about that and remember to treat your injuries
7061315 wow when did everyone leave so fast just then i saw a crowd and now theres no single soul here well except my soul
7061316 i gave everything to hockey and hockey gave me everything this sport is not just about a stick and a ball its also about human values

7061320 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7061321 we have our team but we also have our work cut out for us barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs
7061322 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7061323 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7061324 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7061325 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7061326 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7061327 i am gotrek son on gurni and if you cross me in this matter i will be your death
7061328 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7061329 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7061330 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right
7061331 well i hate you i hate you my lifes alright without you
7061332 everybodys down every soul in every town everybodys got me going oooh ahhh ooh ahh ooh ahh ooh
7061333 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7061334 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7061335 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7061336 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7061337 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7061338 the key tonight was that i had a huge desire to win
7061339 i wanted to pay a debt i owed him we are pretty equal but today i was better
7061340 i had won by one point in chicago he won here by two he was lucky this time
7061341 i didnt target the eye because then it becomes violence not boxing
7061342 it was a fantastic day for me i was so happy to achieve this performance its not easy to achieve double gold in the olympics
7061343 we discussed the race beforehand but we did not do what we said we would
7061344 we talked about maybe after five laps going faster but we started earlier from the beginning after one lap we changed the plan during the race and im sorry the other ethiopians dont have a medal
7061345 this is a silver maybe in 2012 it will be a gold slowly slowly
7061346 there were many good competitors in todays race but especially bekele
7061347 there is a big gap between us but we think we will train harder and we can narrow the gap one day
7061348 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7061349 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7061350 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches

7061353 marks going to be back full speed in the next couple days
7061354 hes going to enter back in the mix by monday if he does all right and handles it hes positioning himself to be the starter its likely itll be that way
7061355 mark has shown he has the ability to be a really big time quarterback in our system
7061356 he has the strongest arm weve had since carson palmer he is a resourceful quarterback able to take off and move and make some plays with his legs and our players really respond to him
7061357 once he was named the starter he came out more energetic more demonstrative and took on more of a leadership role which is what we expected
7061358 its like a heavyweight fighter you win the title and thats it you dont want to look back and you dont want to change thats the way i feel and im working to keep the job
7061359 i have worked with steve on numerous projects over the years he has always been a tremendous resource not only through his advice and experiences but through his ability to help identify the best resources to help get the job done
7061360 i get a tremendous amount of value out of the impactiviti newsletter and blog and my personal interactions with steve woodruff have always been thought provoking and helpful he maintains an extensive network that spans and goes well beyond the pharma sales training community if youre not calling on impactiviti when you have training needs you should
7061361 there comes a point in some peoples lives where they stand back take a gaze at the world around them and say
7061362 the biggest weak point is the lack of purchasable hi def content
7061363 if you sell a box that holds a lot of 1080p movies people want to collect them they dont want to collect them in 480p

7061366 this has been a much requested feature its not even available on dvd players
7061367 no other dvd player can do it it is not even an option with dvd players
7061368 we know exactly what was purchased and how much was spent
7061369 jestem konstytucyjnie najwy szym przedstawicielem rzeczypospolitej i chcia bym tak by traktowany tak e w kancelarii premiera
7061370 to kwestia szacunku dla w asnego pa stwa troszeczk przy tej bardzo liberalnej koncepcji brakuje tego szacunku co jest wielkim zagro eniem dla polski
7061371 to na pewno nie sprzyja polskiej demokracji a przede wszystkim si a napi cia politycznego nie sprzyja polskiej demokracji

7061373 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7061374 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7061375 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7061376 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7061377 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7061378 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7061379 i worked all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7061380 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7061381 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7061382 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7061383 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7061384 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7061385 i think i share the same excitement with the team theres the right kind of energy
7061386 the guys are proud of themselves for the effort put forth in spring and summer
7061387 i think they believe they are capable of a great deal this year and im looking forward to get started
7061388 they bring a great deal of experience and theyre going to create good teachers for the kids
7061389 we hope he calms down gets comfortable after having a nice summer throwing the ball

7061412 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
7061413 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
7061414 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
7061415 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
7061416 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
7061417 i use the bet sheets so i dont have to spend a lot of time here
7061418 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7061433 if you really want a winning ticket this is it
7061434 ive looked at every other possible candidate no one brings to a ticket what hillary brings 18 million people committed to where shes going
7061435 i think she has the qualifications to be president and i think she would be very strong as a campaigner so youre doing the two things that need to be done to be qualified
7061436 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
7061437 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
7061438 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
7061439 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
7061440 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
7061441 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties

7061465 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7061466 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7061467 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7061468 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7061469 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7061470 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful

7061501 for every complex problem there is an answer that is short simple and wrong
7061502 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7061503 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7061504 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7061505 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7061506 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7061507 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7061508 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7061509 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7061510 there will be no contact between the navy and the boats

7061513 when they arrive they will send a messsage to israel and to the rest of the world to pay attention to gaza and to lift the siege
7061514 we hope they will be able to arrive we are optimistic
7061515 the boats will never arrive the israelis will capture them before they get anywhere close to gaza

7061529 artinya beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadhan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang hak dan yang bathil karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya pada hari hari yang lain allah menghendaki kemudahan bagimu dan tidak menghendaki kesukaran bagimu dan hendaklah kamu mencukupkan bilangannya dan hendaklah kamu mengagungkan allah atas petunjuk nya yang diberikan kepadamu supaya kamu bersyukur
7061530 artinya diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa
7061531 artinya jika datang bulan ramadhan maka dibukalah pintu pintu surga dalam riwayat muslim dibukalah pintu pintu rahmat
7061532 artinya jika telah datang awal malam bulan ramadhan diikatlah para syetan dan jin jin yang jahat ditutup pintu pintu neraka tidak ada satu pintu pintu yang dibuka dan dibukalah pintu pintu surga tidak ada satu pintu pun yang tertutup berseru seorang penyeru

7061535 war is among the options it is part of the struggle the milf is determined to continue that struggle
7061536 stop hostilities we will bring the issue to the peace process
7061537 they cannot use peace negotiations as a shield for their criminal acts
7061538 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7061539 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7061540 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7061541 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7061542 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7061543 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7061544 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7061545 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7061546 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7061547 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7061548 i take it that all of you knew this character gordon
7061549 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion

7061555 if you do what i did youll see works every time
7061556 ideas which genuinely push you challenge you nurture you into becoming a leader
7061557 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7061558 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7061559 the security agreement with the us says iraq will not be used as a launch pad for attacks against other countries
7061560 and what do we see in iraq right now what is happening in iraq with people water condition drinking water electricity the devastation that that country is going through it is scary to feel that my country my family is gonna to go through the same or a lot worse
7061561 i think you can see the links quite clearly between iraq and iran before there was an attack on iraq there were sanctions for years and years and years against the country comments and threats against it
7061562 there was the media as well saying that iraq was developing nuclear energy nuclear power nuclear weapons and use that to actually invade and attack the country and they are doing the same with iran now
7061563 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7061564 we gonna fight we gon fight fight for our rights
7061565 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

7061568 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7061569 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7061570 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7061571 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7061572 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7061573 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7061574 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7061575 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nose bleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7061576 as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7061577 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7061578 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7061579 no id like to go on strike right now and end the season and start the playoffs right now
7061580 were just going to keep playing theres a long ways to go here it would be nice to get where the angels are and get a big lead but all we can control is our games and do the best we can
7061581 you get over 100 pitches and weve been there before its not worth risking an injury
7061582 so i understood that ill get a chance at some point but if i go eight and dont give up any runs every time thats not too shabby

7061592 by selecting joe biden for vice president barack obama has shown voters that not even governor tim kaine can hide the fact that he is out of touch with the core values held by the hard working families of virginia virginians deserve a president and a vice president who understand that we need a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis lower taxes for virginias families and who have a record on strong national security what virginia doesnt want is an inexperienced presidential ticket that will raise taxes on families and industries that are most important to virginias economy john mccain believes in lower taxes energy solutions and a stronger national security voters in virginia will support john mccain for president because they always know where he stands
7061593 barack obama has sent virginia voters the message by choosing senator joe biden as his running mate that he just wasnt seeing the momentum in virginia that he had hoped barack obama spent two full days campaigning in virginia and his message is not resonating there is no question in the minds of voters that he will raise taxes on virginia families ignore the energy crisis and continue to support retreat and surrender in iraq voters in virginia will support john mccain because he is a proven leader and ready to be commander in chief on day one he believes in lower taxes for virginia families and has an all of the above plan to solve our energy crisis i am proud to help john mccain to victory in virginia in november
7061594 congratulations to my friend and colleague in the u s senate joe biden for being selected as barack obamas running mate however i am confident as virginians continue to get to know barack obamas record and counterproductive proposals they will see he is out of touch with the core values and issues most important to our families barack obamas plan for our economic competiveness includes raising taxes on individuals retirees and small business owners and creating more carter era taxes and restrictions on our american energy solutions john mccain in comparison has a proven record of character and putting our country first senator mccain will provide the credible leadership america needs for our economic competitiveness national security and energy independence
7061595 at long last the speculation about who senator barack obama would choose as his running mate is over i congratulate senator biden on being selected to run with senator obama in november however it is obvious that senator biden will do nothing to help senator obamas chances of winning in virginia i remain convinced that virginia will vote for john mccain he is the only candidate who has the background knowledge and experience to lead our country at a critical time in our history and he is the only candidate who has put forth positive solutions on important issues such as national security economic security and energy security i look forward to campaigning with senator mccain to victory here in virginia this november
7061596 virginia voters will not support an obama biden ticket this is a ticket that believes in higher taxes more government inaction in the face of rising energy prices and that fundamentally fails to understand the true nature of the enemies we face abroad the contrast between an obama biden ticket and the candidacy of john mccain could not be more stark or more important john mccain believes that lowering taxes is the best way to strengthen the economy and create jobs in virginia while barack obama already voted for higher taxes on virginia families john mccain believes that our energy security is dependent on offshore exploration and nuclear power while barack obamas energy plan is for virginians to merely inflate their tires john mccain believes that we should leave iraq a secure nation while barack obama advocates timetables and surrender there is a clear choice in this campaign and virginians will choos e john mccain this november
7061597 an obama biden ticket lacks the crucial military experience that voters are looking for
7061598 john mccain has put country first above self interest and politics barack obamas foreign policy is based on political calculations our progress in iraq would be lost if barack obama had his way and began to withdraw our forces without concern for ground conditions or the advice of military commanders the course barack obama advocates would weaken our security put peace further out of reach and americans back in harms way

7061710 the disciples came and said to him why do you speak to
7061711 to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given for to him who has will more be given and he will have abundance but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away this is why i speak to them in parables because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear nor do they understand with them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says you shall indeed hear but never understand and you shall indeed see but never perceive for this peoples heart has grown dull and their ears are heavy of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest they should perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear truly i say to you many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see and did not see it and to hear what you hear and did not hear it
7061712 do you not understand this parable how then will you understand all the parables

7061715 n o temos tempo para ficar lamentando entramos um pouco desligados no primeiro tempo contra o flamengo melhoramos no segundo mas eles deram sorte e marcaram no fim agora buscar pontos contra o n utico
7061716 o resultado n o foi bom mas a gente tem que aprender que futebol assim mesmo ainda somos l deres
7061717 o nosso time tem que jogar sempre com a corda esticada n o podemos relaxar nunca porque o campeonato est muito equilibrado e esses cinco pontos de vantagem s o apenas uma gordurinha alertou tcheco

7061726 o campeonato italiano desta temporada deve ser muito disputado pois os clubes se refor aram muito a roma precisar manter a regularidade durante a temporada para lutar pelo t tulo a inter de mil o sempre dif cil de ser superada pois tem uma grande equipe e venceu os ltimos tr s italianos al m disso outras equipes como milan e juventus tamb m apostaram em contrata es e v o brigar pelas primeiras posi es
7061727 eu n o treino nem nunca treinei robinho mas eu gosto dele por seu estilo ser diferente se ele sempre tenta executar dribles por v rias vezes tem um jeito diferenciado de jogar
7061728 temos um time que pode jogar em um sistema e para mudar isso preciso jogadores diferenciados agora temos o deco que se enquadra neste estilo
7061729 eu n o sei de nada pois ontem sexta feira o shevchenko n o treinou pensei que ele estava em mil o mas hoje ele treinou normalmente e n o o questionei sobre o milan n o perguntei sobre nada porque ele est aqui no chelsea treinando conosco
7061730 ouvimos que ele esteve em negocia o mas n o quero saber o que aconteceu isto n o assunto meu minha fun o treinar a equipe
7061731 ele realmente est aberto a isso shinawatra est constrangido pela indigna o trazida ao clube e premier league ele me disse se for necess ria minha sa da da dire o do clube em acordo com premier league tudo bem pois isso n o muda outras coisas
7061732 ele robinho tem de me dizer pessoalmente que quer ficar de fora e n o o fez como est em condi es de jogar minha obriga o coloc lo sem d vida
7061733 were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham north carolina who has had a difficult life
7061734 a nica coisa diferente poder encontrar um amigo ele tem um grande car ter e fico contente por ele estar bem assim porque eu o incentivei ele era meu auxiliar e queria voltar para a parte administrativa no figueirense mas eu dizia que o lugar dele era no campo e que ele tinha condi es de trabalhar
7061735 ser treinador o que ele est fazendo melhor e est mostrando trabalho porque conhece de futebol
7061736 os times est o todos iguais n o tem um diferente jogando acima da m dia os times est o aprendendo a ter plantel s ter uma equipe n o ganha campeonato e isso interessante observar
7061737 o gr mio contratou jogadores recentemente que v o permanecer at o fim do campeonato por isso o gr mio tem uma vantagem n o tem craques mas tem muito bons jogadores e leva vantagem sobre todo mundo porque vai permanecer com o time
7061738 n o tem uma equipe excepcional neste campeonato o gr mio consegue manter a regularidade mas n o diferente das demais tanto que perdeu para o flamengo que vinha de uma seq ncia ruim mesmo dentro de casa n o d para apontar favoritismo hoje em dia o inter por exemplo est se refor ando at nesta reta final do campeonato
7061739 estamos conscientes do que devemos fazer e da nossa responsabilidade ser dif cil mas temos plenas condi es de vencer
7061740 sabia que estava preparado para quando surgisse a oportunidade de viver esse ambiente de grupo estou me sentindo muito bem e se o wanderley precisar de mim estarei disposi o
7061741 a les o foi uma fatalidade e j passado n o quero nem ficar lembrando pois a pior parte ficar tanto tempo parado
7061742 as equipes estar o certamente melhor preparadas de um modo geral e tamb m mais pressionadas por motivos diferentes n o podemos descuidar de nada pois os jogos ter o um grau de dificuldade maior
7061743 eu n o planejo a diferen a para os advers rios temos que fazer a nossa parte vamos iniciar o segundo turno no pr ximo final de semana e n o temos que ficar pensando em ampliar a diferen a ou em quando vamos chegar primeira divis o temos que procurar fazer o melhor a cada rodada pois foi assim que viemos liderando desde o in cio do campeonato
7061744 precisamos continuar firmes na competi o somar pontos e estar sempre entre os quatro nosso racioc nio somar pontos jogar bem e continuar bem n o podemos relaxar em momento algum
7061745 o crb est na zona de rebaixamento o lanterna mas merece todo o nosso respeito temos que encarar o jogo com seriedade para tentar acumular uma gordura de novo sabemos das dificuldades mas temos tudo para dar uma nova arrancada
7061746 o que acontece que o figueirense n o est sendo regular deu uma melhorada muito grande com a chegada do pc s que agora n s estamos caindo no mesmo erro do primeiro turno n o podemos deixar isso acontecer de forma nenhuma
7061747 o grupo conhece as suas limita es e todos precisam se cobrar precisamos jogar no limite
7061748 acho que os desfalques n o pesaram nos outros jogos tamb m tivemos v rios isso n o pode servir de desculpa infelizmente a bola n o entrou criamos oportunidades mas n o aproveitamos um empate em casa n o bom resultado e agora temos que buscas pontos fora

7061758 we heard from an edhat subscriber at 7 14am this morning another email arrived at 11 14am
7061759 this represents a huge increase over previous days when we received no emails at all about this matter
7061760 ed is very flattered by the rumors but they are absolutely not true and if truth be told ed would rather work at the santa barbara news press than become involved in a national political campaign
7061761 we are pleased that this public hearing will be held to consider among other things alternatives to the project that could avoid or reduce potentially significant adverse impacts while meeting the basic objectives of the project we are certainly sensitive to the importance of suicide prevention but it is important that approaches to suicide prevention be carefully and comprehensively planned not expedited to assure that public resources are not unnecessarily degraded or destroyed
7061762 the cold spring bridge is not only one of the great bridges of santa barbara but of our golden state we must protect and preserve it intact for future generations the proposed suicide barriers for the bridge are absolutely unacceptable it is imperative to make this clear to caltrans and local elected officials and the public hearing in october provides an important opportunity for local residents to do so
7061763 sbcags long overdue decision to hold a public hearing on the controversial caltrans barriers proposal finally recognizes the citizens right to have their voices heard the plan from the outset used false data and slanted analysis to justify the need for a barrier this hearing will provide the much needed official forum for the presentation of the pertinent facts and unbiased analysis that counter the unsupported caltrans claims
7061764 i always had faith that id find something like this
7061765 las cosas que empezaron con relativo buen ritmo se han hecho m s lentas no solo por causa del ministerio p blico y del poder judicial sino tambi n porque las pruebas que podr an llevar al inicio de un procedimiento penal y que han sido pedidas en procesos previos de investigaci n al mindef no han sido entregadas argumentando que ya se quemaron los expedientes esas cosas de alg n modo significan ponerles candado a las investigaciones
7061766 deber an ser las primeras interesadas en depurar de sus filas a los miembros que no se han comportado dignamente
7061767 creo que se piensa que si se reconoce que ha habido cr menes por parte de las ff aa inmediatamente se le est dando la raz n a sendero luminoso en la cvr no negamos el valor que han tenido las fuerzas armadas y policiales en la defensa del pa s pero eso no significa que no hubiera responsabilidad de las mismas en determinado momento y en determinados lugares

7061796 set aside for a least a little while the wealth of talent possessed by this amazing u s olympic basketball team you can see dunks and blind passes any time on sportscenter focus not on what this team has accomplished but how dont compare this team to the dream team boors of 1992 who swaggered and taunted their way to the gold medal dont compare these guys to 2004 gang which sleepwalked to the bronze this group which tomorrow will defeat spain for the gold medal is different they smile they respect their opponents they sign autographs they pat little kids on the heads they call their mothers every day when they leave the olympic village its a good bet that they wont trash their rooms the way nhl players did in nagano a decade ago
7061797 yes its easy to make nice when youre winning and these guys have hardly been challenged but through these olympic games maybe just maybe they have both learned and taught a valuable lesson that getting respect from the world is a lot easier when you reciprocate maybe just maybe the rest of the nba is taking notes in 1966 texas western now texas el paso changed college basketball forever by winning the national championship with the first ever all black starting lineup it may be too much to expect that this olympic team will have a similar transformative effect on an nba culture that defines its by its tattoos vulgar language and too frequent police involvement but at least its a start
7061798 as has been amply demonstrated in empirical studies the nature of market outcomes are massively influenced by public policies in education and literacy epidemiology land reform microcredit facilities appropriate legal protection etc and in each of these fields there are things to be done through public action that can radically alter the outcome of local and global economic relations it is this class of interdependences that have to be understood and utilized to alter the inequalities and asymmetries that characterize the world economy

7061814 siamo molto contenti per il primo posto di felipe che ha fatto davvero una bellissima prestazione
7061815 peccato per kimi che avrebbe potuto essere un po piu avanti anche se la quarta posizione non rappresenta comunque un cattivo risultato tutto sommato un bella giornata per la squadra anche se sappiamo bene che quello che conta e la gara domani ci aspetta un pomeriggio in cui ci sara da sudare e non soltanto per il caldo i fattori decisivi saranno quelli di sempre affidabilita in primis strategia prestazione lavoro della squadra e dei piloti ma in piu ci sara lincognita legata ad un tracciato dove non si e mai corso da parte nostra ce la metteremo tutta per cercare di conquistare il miglior risultato possibile in ottica campionato
7061816 e bello essere in pole position particolarmente dopo la grande delusione di budapest ma so bene che la gara e domani e che ce quindi ancora tanta strada da fare il mio primo tentativo in q3 e stato molto buono e nel secondo ho fatto un bel miglioramento nel primo settore la pole e arrivata proprio da li la pista oggi era ancora molto scivolosa anche a causa della pioggia caduta ieri sera dopo le libere di stamani pensavo che le gomme piu dure sarebbero state le piu competitive in qualifica ma allinizio delle qualifiche non mi ci trovavo piu cosi bene e allora abbiamo usato la mescola piu morbida la squadra ha fatto un ottimo lavoro nella preparazione di questo appuntamento e la voglio ringraziare per avermi messo a disposizione una macchina cosi forte speriamo di fare una bella corsa domani
7061817 il quarto posto non e quello che volevo ottenere ma non e certo la fine del mondo avrei potuto essere piu avanti in griglia ma nel mio ultimo tentativo in q3 ho bloccato le ruote in un paio di punti e ho perso del tempo prezioso niente di drammatico ma su questo circuito una piccola sbavatura ti costa tantissimo credo di poter dire ancora la mia nella lotta per la vittoria soprattutto se riusciro a fare una buona partenza abbiamo una buona macchina particolarmente competitiva in gara
7061818 una bella qualifica molto serrata e resa ancora piu incerta dalle condizioni meteorologiche un primo e un quarto posto rappresentano un buon bilancio anche se avrebbe potuto essere migliore felipe ha fatto due bellissimi giri in q3 mentre kimi per un soffio ha mancato la possibilita di partire dal lato piu pulito della pista proprio la partenza sara uno dei momenti decisivi della gara domani sara importante cercare di raccogliere il massimo possibile dei punti con entrambi i piloti sappiamo di aver a disposizione una macchina competitiva sulla distanza e cercheremo di sfruttarla nella maniera migliore dovremo fare molta attenzione nella gestione di tutti i possibili scenari che si presenteranno come in tutti i circuiti cittadini leventualita di una neutralizzazione della corsa sara sempre incombente
7061819 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7061820 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7061821 ahora la convicci n absoluta de mi vida descansa en la creencia de que la soledad
7061822 become garrulously 5 3 to solve the system error but it didnt work would you please give me some suggestion how to fix these problems
7061823 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7061824 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7061825 considering all the preparation involved for this new circuit its very disappointing not to have any of our cars in the final part of qualifying i am sure we had the potential to do so but potential is not an ultimate result however im sure it will be an interesting race tomorrow in the event here several weeks ago we saw that the safety car can play an important role and we will think hard about our strategy to try to make the most of our situation
7061826 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well
7061827 it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7061828 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7061829 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7061830 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7061831 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope well be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
7061832 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7061833 today we saw another very good afternoons work from both lewis and heikki characterised by strong lap times that reflect their respective race strategies all in all therefore were well prepared for the first grand prix to be held on this exciting new racetrack all the drivers did an exemplary job today in fact avoiding the walls in the tricky conditions we hope that tomorrows race will be equally incident free and that in time the valencia event will become a regular integral and much admired element of the formula 1 calendar i would like to offer our congratulations to all concerned and to the valencia authorities in particular with appropriate promotion this grand prix promises to become a fabulous adjunct to our sports existing harbourside spectacular namely monaco

7061886 sen joe biden and sen lugar were on cnn late edition this morning as usual both senators have it right on iraq sen biden has given some really good suggestions over the past 3 years to this administration he has proposed a regional conference of neighbors to iraq put together a comprehensive peace plan for iraq biden looks more and more presidential and instead of just complaining about what is wrong with the administration he offers some worthy while suggestions as to how to solve the problems in iraq he could have just remained silent but he hasnt he has nothing to gain politically if the bush administration took his ideas seriously and implemented them joe would then not have much to run on in the 2008 elections except to say they were his ideas but sen biden wants to see a victory for the usa as it is too important to lose as he has stated many times this is the kind of unselfish advice i wish more would offer this president from the republican side instead they seem to want to let the president and vp run this game without their two cents of advice included that way they can say it was a failure of the president and not theirs wheres the accountability we need more candidates like senator biden running for every available seat in congress and the senate notice i said candidates not democrats nor republicans this country needs true patriots and unselfish non politicians to help change this country back to where it once was respected across the world

7061888 senator joe biden was on meet the press again yesterday sunday nov 27th and he was well prepared for the questions thrown at him by tim russett moderator it is the truth that for the past few years sen biden has tried to help this administration win the war in iraq i have mentioned a number of times where sen biden s suggestions made good sense but they went unheeded by president bush and more importantly by sec of defense rumsfeld who i have lost a lot of admiration for over the past few years he seems to have become very stubborn and not listening to good ideas he too surrounds himself with idealogues so they all chant the same chorus now it seems that many americans are starting to come to the same conclusion i did back on my posting of august 5th when i said we were at a turning point and that the war in iraq felt more and more like vietnam when we all knew that we werent going to win that war either and it too was a turning point bush has 6 months maximum to turn this thing positive i doubt he has the skill or competency or desire to take a risk and make a course change which is required to win this thing i am afraid it was a bad idea to go in there and it was a bad idea not to have a plan to secure the peace everything promised there has gone bad we dont use the oil of the iraqis to pay for the war we have no real allies there any more and we are the only ones dying there besides the iraqis god help the people of that nation when we leave
7061889 bidens comments on meet the press were spot on the sentiment of regarding where the country is regarding iraq

7061929 es la primera vez en la historia del taekwondo ol mpico que un resultado es cambiado al principio los jueces decidieron que la competidora china era la ganadora pero luego de la revisi n era claro que la brit nica hab a sido la vencedora
7061930 de acuerdo a las reglas las autoridades chinas pod an apelar y no aceptar el cambio pero como saben aceptaron en nombre del esp ritu deportivo
7061931 para m todo estaba arreglado a m me ofrecieron dinero para que perdiera

7061934 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7061935 my fellow americans its now been over a decade since that goddamn deadbeat soviet union lay down on the job we just cant stage a respectable military industrial complex with a shirker like that in the cast so its time to promote the understudy
7061936 well if nothing is true then your statement that nothing is true is also false meaning that something must be true
7061937 mariano rivera is not as good as he used to
7061938 well that had to be the easiest save for rivera

7061945 michael phelps is great but you cant take swimming all that seriously
7061946 es ist gro artig auf der pole position zu stehen besonders nach der gro en entt uschung von budapest
7061947 ich bin mir jedoch absolut bewusst dass das rennen morgen ist wir haben also noch einen weiten weg vor uns mein erster versuch im dritten qualifying teil war sehr gut im zweiten konnte ich mich im ersten sektor gut verbessern und daher r hrt die pole position heute war die strecke immer noch sehr rutschig besonders nach dem regen der vergangenen nacht
7061948 nach dem freien training am morgen dachte ich dass der h rtere reifen im qualifying der konkurrenzf higste sein w rde aber zu beginn der einheit f hlte ich mich nicht mehr so wohl und wir kehrten aus diesem grund auf die weichere mischung zur ck das team leistete gro artige arbeit bei der vorbereitung auf diese veranstaltung ich m chte mich bei ihnen daf r bedanken dass sie mir ein solch starkes auto gegeben haben ich hoffe dass wir morgen ein gutes rennen haben k nnen
7061949 der vierte platz ist nicht das was ich mir erhofft hatte aber es ist definitiv kein weltuntergang
7061950 ich h tte in der startaufstellung weiter vorn stehen k nnen aber auf meinem letzten versuch blockierte ich im dritten qualifying teil die r der ein paar mal und verlor wertvolle zeit es war nichts dramatisches aber auf diesem kurs kostet ein kleiner fehler sehr viel ich denke immer noch dass ich um den sieg k mpfen kann besonders dann wenn ich es schaffe einen guten start hinzubekommen wir haben ein gutes auto das besonders im rennen konkurrenzf hig sein sollte
7061951 dies war eine gute qualifying einheit sehr eng und aufgrund des wetters war sie noch unvorhersehbarer
7061952 ein erster und ein vierter platz sind eine gute basis auch wenn wir noch besser h tten sein k nnen felipe fuhr im dritten qualifying teil zwei gro artige runden w hrend es kimi knapp verpasste in der lage zu sein von der sauberen seite der strecke zu starten fakt ist dass der start morgen im rennen einer der entscheidenden momente sein wird
7061953 morgen wird es wichtig sein zu versuchen mit beiden fahrern so viele punkte wie m glich zu holen wir haben ein auto das auf longruns konkurrenzf hig ist und wir werden versuchen dies so gut wie m glich zu nutzen wir m ssen allen m glichen szenarien aufmerksamkeit schenken die auftauchen k nnen wie auf allen stra en strecken h ngt das risiko einer safety car phase immer ber dem rennen

7061955 i want biffa the boys at the very top not to try to cover anything up or hide anything
7061956 come clean and then sort yourselves out and make sure this never happens again
7061957 es ist klar dass ich nach diesem qualifying entt uscht bin denn ich hatte ganz andere vorstellungen
7061958 jetzt steht uns morgen ein schwierigeres rennen bevor aber auf einem stra enkurs kann alles passieren wir m ssen weiter hart arbeiten und uns eine strategie berlegen mit der wir morgen auf alle eventualit ten vorbereitet sind eine oder mehrere safety car phasen sind nicht unwahrscheinlich
7061959 ich bin von meinem qualifying entt uscht denn ich h tte heute mehr erreichen k nnen
7061960 ich glaube nicht dass dieses ergebnis unsere wahre pace widerspiegelt denn sowohl fernando als auch ich hatten das potenzial in q3 einzuziehen ich werde mich mit meinen ingenieuren jetzt auf ein aggressives rennen vorbereiten um mich m glichst weit nach vorne zu arbeiten
7061961 angesichts der umfangreichen vorbereitung auf diese neue strecke ist es sehr entt uschend kein auto unter die top 10 gebracht zu haben
7061962 ich bin sicher dass wir das potenzial dazu hatten aber potenzial ist eben kein ergebnis trotzdem stehen wir vor einem interessanten rennen im er ffnungsrennen vor ein paar wochen sah man dass das safety car hier eine wichtige rolle spielen kann wir werden intensiv dar ber nachdenken mit welchen strategien wir das beste aus unserer situation machen k nnen
7061963 unsere positionen sind entt uschend vor allem da wir der meinung waren gestern eine gute vorbereitung hingelegt zu haben und ermutigende zeiten fuhren
7061964 aber noch ist nicht alles verloren wir werden nun eine starke strategie entwickeln mit der wir aus diesen startpl tzen das maximum herausholen
7061965 un nen em va preguntar on s el meu pare
7061966 vaig veure una bola de fum grand ssima i vaig pensar que en passava una de grossa
7061967 a lhotel no hi ha cap comentari sobre associar se aix s un tema que ha creat lopini p blica de fet ahir es va convocar una reuni sobre aix i no hi va anar ning ni els convocants perqu potser aquest no s el moment
7061968 les fam lies estan nervioses i un simple calla un moment pot fer que comencin les bufetades

7061974 it was an unbelievable finish from mitcham to get all those 10s that is probably the highest score i have ever seen in one dive
7061975 how to get your cold one in top shape using high elf babies 10 simple steps
7061976 as a preacher of the gospel and a pastor of this church i am admonished by gods word to
7061977 to admonish to convince to correct to tell a fault
7061978 guides i dont want to know how you get fastest out of each zone to rush to the level cap
7061979 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7061980 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7061981 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7061982 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7061983 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7061984 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7061985 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7061986 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7061987 this has been a big bonus going into 2012 as i now know what the olympics are like
7061988 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
7061989 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7061990 im a bum and i finched on a friend who was expecting and counting on me
7061991 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7061992 last thing i remember i was running for the door
7061993 freunde ich habe wichtige nachrichten die ich offiziell machen m chte ich habe joe biden zu meinem running mate bestimmt
7061994 es gibt keinen sch rferen kritiker an barack obamas fehlender erfahrung als joe biden
7061995 john mccain ist ein pers nlicher freund und es w re mir eine ehre mit ihm oder gegen ihn anzutreten
7061996 the arrival of these two boat is a very symbolic gesture for the palestinian cause to end the siege end the occupation
7061997 in fact those phrases are written across the peace boats which carry flags from more than 70 nationalities
7061998 they want provocation at sea but they wont get it
7061999 there has been no degradation in the capability to access manage and share terrorist information
7062000 its been seven years since 9 11 and we appear to be no better prepared no better able to connect the dots than we were seven years ago
7062001 its like having a dictionary without it being in alphabetical order
7062002 the information may be there you just cant find it
7062003 representative millers subcommittee has had no interaction with the nctc or the intelligence community on the railhead program
7062004 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence and work with the federation to 100 per cent clarify this situation and put this to rest
7062005 so far everything that has been received demonstrates we have no problem for the eligibility of the competitors
7062006 for the time being there is nothing i can add
7062007 this is a problem when you have an age limit that there is a temptation for manipulation
7062008 who cares if a 14 year old can take the gold medal
7062009 media reports in china have suggested that three of the gymnasts he yang and jiang yuyuan might be much younger than 16
7062010 i want a discussion with open mind and hope that the issue will be solved and nano will remain in west bengal
7062011 if the atmosphere do not improve soon we have to think about relocating the project
7062012 i request the opposition for a peaceful protests and also want to have another round of discussions with them
7062013 obama has chosen biden as his vice president i find it extremely boring
7062014 what a bad choice biden is like three hundred years old
7062015 we are taking something that works and creating confusion in the consumers mind when you create confusion in the consumers mind their confidence drops and thats dangerous
7062016 reduce the regulatory burden by eliminating the requirements for mandatory label registration
7062017 they prevent mislabelling and unsafe products from ending up on store shelves they catch things like illegal chemicals and misleading health claims what we want to do is prevent these products from reaching the marketplace to chase down these products in grocery stores doesnt seem like a good use of our inspectors
7062018 it doesnt make sense to do away with pre market review to save 87 000
7062019 thats disrespect i dont know where theyre going with that
7062020 he got me in a little hold and just bit my chest
7062021 he knows he bit me but its okay its cool
7062022 they love boxing theyre a boxing country they just love it so i understand if they want to boo it doesnt matter
7062023 im not happy with the way the judges scored the fight but thats it
7062024 with his selection of joe biden senator obama has made crystal clear his commitment to raising taxes
7062025 the thing about a campaign is when you start getting over two players its cool to have that but the narrative quality decreases exponentially with more players once you get a third or a fourth player in there then youre in the middle of fighting a bad guy and somebodys triggering a cutscene and people are flapping their gums and nobody knows whats going on with the story whereas if you keep it two players keep it focused grab a buddy and go through the blockbuster experience and then grab five players and fight against the locust thats how were doing it
7062026 we have been left with no choice than to evict this resident from the property following continued efforts on our part to provide him with the opportunity to improve his behaviour
7062027 i think we got the right decision ive a feeling it might not be upheld by the planning inspector unfortunately i think sometimes democracy costs money
7062028 i genuinely believe the traffic consultants have got it wrong they dont really understand the circumstances locally
7062029 were not always right and sometimes we get it wrong but im prepared to take that risk
7062030 this is a matter of public decency and every person in this town should be greatly indignant that it is on our streets it is disgraceful behaviour and very distasteful
7062031 this is beyond the pale and not what a lakeland tourist town is about
7062032 we need a licensing scheme to be set up as soon as possible so we can rid our streets of some unwanted performers people may think these acts are amusing but when they target a particular member of the audience i think this is intimidation

7062070 i was kept in a cell for two days they kept telling me i should quit working in the media
7062071 and ive got much more on obamas questionable role in funneling money to acorn in once this is commercially viable the vampires will have no need to continue to keep their existence secret suing the pope for property seized by the church
7062072 is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
7062073 honey did you remember to pack those ten year old files on the 1992 campaign and media bias
7062074 people of earth stop your bickering i am from harvard and im here to help
7062075 dont you conservatives understand democrats care about the little guy theyre on the side of the proletariat i mean workers and as obama has so eloquently put it if the workers would only stop clinging to their silly sky god and guns theyd understand that
7062076 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7062077 barack you are running for the top job in america so when you mention the u s or its history just dispense with the harvard qualifiers the howevers and buts the oppression studies talking points the morally equivalent cute examples the tangled legal nuances and professorial huffing and simply say nice things about your country and if you cant dont say anything at all about it the voters know that you believe america is not perfect but they dont know whether you believe it is good
7062078 in these times of high gasoline prices i believe the federal government should do all it can to ensure that federal agencies and departments are appropriately reducing gasoline consumption this goal can be accomplished with the adoption of personnel policies to limit unnecessary commuting
7062079 i hate chet edwards because he wears ties that i disapprove of
7062080 if you talk to warren buffet hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7062081 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7062082 isnt it reassuring to have a presidential candidate saying he sees some merit in taxing the heck out of something
7062083 to direct hundreds of would be volunteers from the university to the dozens of local causes that need help
7062084 help bridge the gap the real one and the perceived on that exists between the school and the hyde park community
7062085 honestly i thought it would be yesterday who wants to news drop on an august friday
7062086 if our workspace happens to be adjacent to the journals at either convention these two coming weeks we may have to have a pay for view showdown
7062087 a continuing uptick in consumer confidence and increase in perceived success in iraq could benefit mccain
7062088 do i think that the idea to promote regional cooperation in the region is a good one and that turkey has a role to play here
7062089 the answer is yes but this particular proposal is not the way to approach it in a general sense i would agree that turkey has a role to play and needs to be more active
7062090 he was vetted his trial balloon didnt raise a stink i think they talk about the ones theyre not going to pick as a head fake and theyre not talking about him
7062091 i didnt want to be an american priest in peru
7062092 i wanted to be a peruvian priest under the authority of a peruvian bishop
7062093 i thought thats where ill go what have i got to lose
7062094 we reject the pernicious belief commonly held at our most highly esteemed institutions that fighting our nations battles is someone elses job
7062095 i find attractive the arguments of scholars such as stephen macedo who defend an activist supreme court that would
7062096 that caught me off guard and i had no recollection of making so atypical a statement which shook me up even more
7062097 now it would seem to me what you were talking about
7062098 is you find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of property rights because you know that is what they write about
7062099 it has been quite some time since i have read professor macedo but i dont believe that in my writings i have indicated that we should have an activist supreme court or that we should have any form of activism on the supreme court
7062100 but the libertarian argument overlooks the place of the supreme court in a scheme of separation of powers one does not strengthen self government and the rule of law by having the non democratic branch of the government make policy
7062101 lets see weve got the big condo in phoenix the ranch in sedona arlington
7062102 john mccain never said he didnt know how many houses he and mrs mccain have
7062103 that is clear he referred the questioners to his staff because this is a question that has been debated at the staff level with some reporters who based on an inaccurate reading of senate disclosure forms have reported more homes than the mccains actually own and some press reports that have indicated fewer homes than they actually own so by trying to avoid a debate about the holdings of the hensley family trust he simply attempted to move on to the next question
7062104 the next 24 hours are not going to be rosy
7062105 we feel like it will sting in the course of the 24 hour news cycle but in the long run by obamas making a flimsy attack about houses we will get more bang for our buck by talking about tony rezko
7062106 despite all the hype over obamas religious outreach a new pew survey indicates obama actually has slightly less support from evangelicals than john kerry had at this point four years ago
7062107 i actually sent neil cavuto a thank you note once for pronouncing short lived correctly on the air
7062108 just as someone who has blue eyes is blue eyed

7062112 ive had enough enough with weirdly provocative stagings by arrogant directors who think that innovation means boring the audience using public funds often these directors are simply uneducated
7062113 john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion
7062114 we left corporate america which is a lot of what were asking young people to do dont go into corporate america
7062115 an amazing distillation of the inside the beltway mainstream media economic consensus
7062116 look im living the american dream i came home from war married a hot blond beer heiress what do you want from me
7062117 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time ayers reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
7062118 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats a hundred percent sure
7062119 no one will ever again tell poland what to do and what not to do
7062120 go ahead and move on with research and development but as far as putting holes in the ground in poland we are saying no
7062121 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
7062122 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
7062123 i heard that story in 1970 1971 back in that time frame anybody who says its not true is full of
7062124 daley wont say whether uic should release obama ayers records
7062125 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
7062126 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
7062127 how big a vulnerability is obamas born alive vote for obama
7062128 i just dont know how you square the philosophical differences
7062129 im a platform kind of guy and i would encourage the mccain camp to be cognizant of the pro life position for the base and especially for the people who are doing the get out the vote work for us
7062130 but its one of the fundamental foundations of the party i would encourage the mccain camp to be aware of who were going to have working in the vineyards i understand its probably sexy to look at other alternatives and see what they bring to the table but at the same time im a business guy and were talking about customers youve got to have volunteers and the vice presidential pick will be crucial
7062131 he would not have dared to act without outside support once he did russia could not afford inaction
7062132 tskhinvali was in smoking ruins and thosuands of people were fleeing before any russian troops arrived
7062133 which side do you think god will take when i stand before him in judgment that i protected the rights of a woman over her reproduction or the rights of the unborn to live
7062134 i think youve got it right but there are too many twists and turns to what youre discussing so itll never get on the radar

7062143 toda vez que la competencia disciplinaria de la comisi n de funcionamiento y reestructuraci n del sistema judicial se origina en una norma que emana de la asamblea constituyente y por tanto de rango superior al legal establecida en 1999 es decir con anterioridad a la causa iniciada contra los ex jueces ya que se le otorg competencia de forma general para conocer de todos los procesos disciplinarios contra los jueces de venezuela bajo un procedimiento com n y no existe una norma a nivel interno que expresamente haya asignado la competencia para conocer del caso en cuesti n a un rgano distinto a la comisi n por todo ello la corte decidi que no se configur una violaci n del derecho a ser juzgado por un tribunal competente consagrado en el art culo 8
7062144 en definitiva se trata de dos procesos diferenciados por ello la corte estima que no se viol la cl usula general de no discriminaci n contenida en el art culo 1 1 de la convenci n americana en relaci n con el derecho sustantivo a ser o do dentro de un plazo razonable consagrado en el art culo 8 1 de dicho tratado

7062151 we just cant tell them that if they do that they will not have urinary incontinence in the future
7062152 we were free of the woods and bushes and fairly upon the broad prairie at noon we stopped to rest not far from a little creek replete with frogs and young turtles the horses were turned to feed among the scattered bushes of a low oozy meadow a drowsy springlike sultriness pervaded the air and the voices of ten thousand young frogs and insects just awakened into life rose from the creek and meadows
7062153 ill agree to your terms if you answer a question
7062154 how will i know i hate performing below expectations jenna and after you took the time to look so absolutely

7062157 you didnt tell me where you wanted me to kiss you
7062158 now now its more fun when i have to figure things out on my own
7062159 personally i would love to place a kiss right here
7062160 but i dont think thats what you had in mind with your request
7062161 this looks like it has potential but i think you would prefer something closer to here
7062162 here is this the spot professor should i test my hypothesis
7062163 hmm i dont think that was quite right will you give me another chance
7062164 thank you i promise ill get it right this time now i think i was close last time i was close wasnt i

7062166 republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child
7062167 the holocaust was an obscene period in our nations history i mean in this centurys history but we all lived in this century i didnt live in this century
7062168 quite frankly teachers are the only profession that teach our children
7062169 it isnt pollution thats harming the environment its the impurities in our air and water that are doing it

7062171 if it was purely about money i would have signed with league straight away gregan writes in his autobiography halfback half forward
7062172 who hasnt watched sonny bill williams hes special very special gregan said
7062173 i think sonny bill will thrive under tana because tanas got that shared experience having played league as well
7062174 tanas very good in the subtleties of that position centre and he couldnt get a better mentor than tana umaga he was the premier outside centre from pretty much the moment he made the transition
7062175 a lot of those clubs are backed by very wealthy businessmen who love the game of rugby want to support a team and are happy to pay what it takes gregan said
7062176 i think its a threat for a lot of sports
7062177 it would have been good but my decisions not made on that
7062178 playing with victor matfield andrew mehrtens anton oliver that was special we will be mates for the rest of our lives
7062179 it got to the stage at last years world cup where if you were in your own half youd just kick a high ball see what happens wait for a penalty kick at goal it wasnt great rugby it was terrible to play gregan said
7062180 you started getting rewarded for playing a more conservative game by being positive you were actually doing yourself a disservice
7062181 playing that way its very easy to hide in test rugby you shouldnt be allowed to hide easily
7062182 the thing that encouraged me from the moment i played the game was actually using the ball and trying to create space
7062183 so many of those international players want to play super 14 they watch it and say i want to play that rugby gregan said
7062184 im not going to name any that would be wrong but yeah i know some who would love to do it

7062191 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7062192 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7062193 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7062194 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7062195 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7062196 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7062197 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7062198 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record
7062199 theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7062200 there is bipartisan support in congress for all three of these measures
7062201 so instead of spending the next month deadlocked on matters where republicans and democrats disagree members of congress should come together to pass legislation in these areas where there is agreement
7062202 the police told me that some cases are particularly difficult
7062203 they want to identify their loved ones soon so they can go home people are anxious to begin the grieving process
7062204 we dont want more psychologists we want someone to tell us what happened
7062205 woke up trapped between two seats with her seat belt still on
7062206 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7062207 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7062208 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7062209 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7062210 there will be no contact between the navy and the boats
7062211 we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board should an emergency develop
7062212 we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
7062213 when they arrive they will send a messsage to israel and to the rest of the world to pay attention to gaza and to lift the siege
7062214 we hope they will be able to arrive we are optimistic
7062215 the boats will never arrive the israelis will capture them before they get anywhere close to gaza
7062216 identification of company officials and functions physical addresses vehicle ownership employee identification and operational similarities
7062217 fmcsa takes its motor coach oversight and safety responsibilities seriously and will continue to investigate carriers with questionable relationships to ensure our orders and regulations are followed to the fullest extent possible
7062218 there is absolutely no tolerance for operators who attempt to game the system at the risk of endangering the traveling public
7062219 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction a security official said
7062220 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts said abdifatah ajos sanura a director at the shamo hotel where the pair stayed
7062221 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped sadia mohamed said
7062222 thats certainly an option and it would be a relatively easy fix
7062223 the important thing is that it did nothing to challenge the creation or existence of that district
7062224 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7062225 i came out here ready i came out here prepared i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7062226 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7062227 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7062228 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7062229 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7062230 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7062231 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7062232 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7062233 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7062234 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7062235 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7062236 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7062237 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7062238 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7062239 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7062240 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7062241 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7062242 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7062243 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7062244 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7062245 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7062246 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7062247 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7062248 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness
7062249 io non so amare ma se sapessi farlo ti amerei fidati
7062250 my father and my uncle had the chance to live a true bedouin life but i am being deprived of this and now so are my children the life of the bedouin the freedom of movement its finished
7062251 their lifestyle is definitely under threat from a number of issues
7062252 its about their need to get better access to water and grazing sources and at the end of the day that requires a political solution
7062253 i as an old man have one wish in life that the bedouin life will continue because it symbolizes so many things endurance patience truthfulness
7062254 they will keep their traditions they will keep their dialects even though they live in buildings they keep their guest rooms and hospitality
7062255 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7062256 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7062257 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7062258 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7062259 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7062260 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7062261 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7062262 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7062263 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7062264 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7062265 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7062266 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7062267 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7062268 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7062269 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7062270 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7062271 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7062272 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7062273 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7062274 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7062275 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7062276 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7062277 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7062278 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7062279 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7062280 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7062281 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7062282 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7062283 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7062284 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7062285 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7062286 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7062287 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7062288 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7062289 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7062290 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7062291 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7062292 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7062293 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7062294 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7062295 il mio cuore aveva mai amato occhi rinnegatelo perch non ha mai conosciuto la bellezza fino ad ora
7062296 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7062297 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7062298 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7062299 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7062300 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7062301 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7062302 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7062303 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7062304 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7062305 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7062306 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7062307 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7062308 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7062309 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7062310 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7062311 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7062312 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7062313 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7062314 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7062315 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7062316 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7062317 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster
7062318 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7062319 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7062320 as long as the earth endures seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night will never cease
7062321 dont pretend to be deaf marianne ive seen you tapping your fingers to the rhythm of the music while you waited for your christine
7062322 that doesnt mean you want a part time job for extra income i know that
7062323 its only natural christine is your friend youve arranged to meet here and instead of her you find me here
7062324 chrstinne yes im fine yes well no im not fine where the hell are you
7062325 what argentina but why what are you doing there alright ill shut up
7062326 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole
7062327 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed

7062333 metaphorically the criminal justice pipeline is like a slave ship transporting human cargo along interstate triangular trade routes from black and brown communities through the middle passage of police precincts holding pens detention centers and courtrooms to downstate jails or upstate prisons back to communities as unrehabilitated escapees and back to prison or jail in a vicious recidivist cycle
7062334 in a criminalized economy the risk of imprisonment is almost a form of business license tax
7062335 t he penal system can be viewed as a type of labor market institution that systematically influences mens employment and has a pervasive influence on the life chances of disadvantaged minorities
7062336 the lost potential earnings savings consumer demand and human and social capital cost black communities untold millions of dollars in potential economic development worsening an inner city political economy already crippled by decades of capital flight and de industrialization

7062346 the fourth r conflicts over religion in american public schools
7062347 the coin of religious freedom we must never forget has two sides
7062348 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
7062349 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
7062350 the next democrat whether its me or sen clinton or john kerry whomever the democratic nominee theyd better be able to ante up right in front of the american people two things security and faith
7062351 if we cant negotiate the faith issue forget it we wont win
7062352 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
7062353 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
7062354 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
7062355 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7062356 my idea of self of family of community of the wider world comes straight from my religion its not so much the bible the beatitudes the ten commandments the sacraments or the prayers i learned its the culture
7062357 i was raised at a time when the catholic church was fertile with new ideas and open discussion about some of the basic social teaching of the catholic church
7062358 a catholic teacher led me to see that if you cannot defend your faith to reason then you have a problem
7062359 i dont think i have the right to impose my view on something i accept as a matter of faith on the rest of society
7062360 joe biden is one of the most sincere catholics ive known in my 40 years as a priest
7062361 i just have to tell you the popes wrong on this im going with the president that was morality this is politics
7062362 if i were an ordained priest id be taking some issue with some of the more narrow interpretations of the gospel being taken now
7062363 but my church is more than 2 000 years old theres always been a tug of war among prelates and informed lay members
7062364 when he sat next to you in a catholic church or a fundamentalist church he respected your views
7062365 i can hardly wait for one of these guys on the other side tell me about family values i can hardly wait for them to tell me a guy whos commuted for 34 years to get home and put my kids to bed
7062366 i can hardly wait for them to tell me a guy whos been married for 30 years when theyve been divorced three times i can hardly wait
7062367 this is a nation founded on the idea of the separation of church and state after 200 years why the hell would you want to start messing with that
7062368 it was not written to prohibit the governments acknowledgement of god in my opinion the courts decision is dead wrong
7062369 this is a nation founded on the idea of the church and state after 200 years why the hell would you want to go messing with that
7062370 people are interested to know why i picked harriet miers they want to know harriet miers background they want to know as much as they possibly can before they form opinions part of harriet miers life is her religion
7062371 i call that groping it sounds like a man who is going down and decides to try to throw something to his supporters
7062372 the american people wanted to believe that their president was guided by moral values that were permanent and unshakable and fairly clear and of course these derive from religious faith and i dont think it has to be christianity
7062373 but i think thats a legitimate expectation on the part of the american
7062374 i have confidence that intelligent people joe biden senator bayh and ms clinton i think they are very carefully considering what happened in 2004 and how they can avoid the pitfalls of being branded as nonreligious and appealing to the moderate voters who were alienated before
7062375 i know if they are going to run for president they are obsessed with this subject
7062376 we havent seen this sort of push from the churches since the anti apartheid movement
7062377 i came together to raise and move this issue before the congress and administration particularly in a very difficult political environment
7062378 losers always whine about their best winners go home and fuck the prom queen

7062409 one of the two great crimes against humanity in the 20th century along with the holocaust
7062410 would not have a fair background to show its strength
7062411 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
7062412 his majesty is extremely anxious to terminate the war as soon as possible
7062413 should however the united states and great britain insist on unconditional surrender japan would be forced to fight to the bitter end
7062414 with the sincerity of our desire to end the war and have them understand that we are trying to end hostilities by asking for very reasonable terms in order to secure and maintain our national existence and honor
7062415 would result only in making the japanese desperate and thereby increase our casualty lists
7062416 because of the vast sums that had been spent on the project
7062417 there was never from about two weeks from the time i took charge of this project any illusion on my part but that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
7062418 communicated to us the anxiety of the united states government about the russian attitude
7062419 beginning to speak of communism as they once spoke of nazism and are invoking continental solidarity and hemispheric defense against it
7062420 here then was a speedy end to the second world war
7062421 the psychological effect on stalin of the bombs was twofold
7062422 the americans had not only used a doomsday machine they had used it when as
7062423 under the present circumstances i have concluded that our only alternative is to accept the potsdam proclamation and terminate the war

7062436 a piece of sushi sold as the luxury treat white tuna turned out to be mozambique tilapia a much cheaper fish that is often raised by farming roe supposedly from flying fish was actually from smelt seven of nine samples that were called red snapper were mislabeled and they turned out to be anything from atlantic cod to acadian redfish an endangered species
7062437 mao declared that the chinese should civilise their spirits and be brutal on their bodies
7062438 he may not have been right about everything but this is one gem of wisdom which seems to ring true judging by what can be seen in china and the contrast which can be found in

7062441 what if we took the shield and joan of arcadia and took out the god character and made the main character more conventionally good
7062442 my character has paid this character for the gas tanks my characters gang needs to transport the meth we sell in order to make our shit tons of money if i suspect he is a cop why dont i just shoot him i am not a 16 year old gang member but a grown ass man who has apparently the capacity to make wise business decisions why again am i forcing someone who doesnt want it and with whom i wont have dealings after this because i dont trust him to use my product for free isnt this the luckiest son of a bitch in this show he gets all my money for the gas tanks and he gets my drugs for free
7062443 i cant tell you where he is but i got a text message from him and i know where he is and hes safe
7062444 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life

7062449 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it
7062450 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians
7062451 we want people to see the palestinian problem as one of human rights not feeding them rice
7062452 paths to innovation are often filled with these realms of uncertainty
7062453 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
7062454 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
7062455 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
7062456 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
7062457 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7062458 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7062459 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7062460 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7062461 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7062462 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7062463 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
7062464 to avoid the media provocation in the high seas as they the organizers planned
7062465 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7062466 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7062467 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
7062468 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7062469 we were still very low very close to the ground
7062470 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7062471 i thought that if there was something wrong the right thing to do is switch planes i told my husband they should put us on another plane
7062472 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7062473 we were still very low very close to the ground
7062474 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7062475 i thought that if there was something wrong the right thing to do is switch planes i told my husband they should put us on another plane
7062476 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7062477 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7062478 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7062479 i am deeply saddened by the bologna familys terrible loss my heart goes out to the family during this difficult time
7062480 it was highly foreseeable that ramos upon his return to the streets of san francisco would murder men who appeared to be latinos or african americans
7062481 there are clearly many many restrictions on when and whether san francisco police officers can communicate with the federal government on an individuals immigration status and those restrictions played a role in a significant way to horrible events that unfolded on june 22
7062482 it was just a horrific tragedy because it was preventable
7062483 if the city had followed the law anthony matthew and michael bologna would most certainly be alive today
7062484 all of these official enactments orders mandates and endorsements of sanctuary policies were reinforced by an unwritten but enforced policy that discouraged police officers from reporting any illegal alien
7062485 the bayshore neighborhood can finally be revitalized and receive a grocery store bank post office and elementary school

7062489 i began to compromise my christian values partying and dating guys who werent christians
7062490 the turning point in my life the catalyst that propelled me further into an unhealthy lifestyle
7062491 i tied all the construction to classic craftsmanship i wanted it to feel old fashioned and classic but still luxurious and flexible to anyone who wants to live in and enjoy this wonderful neighborhood for what it is
7062492 joyce had a great vision and you never really know at first if a client actually has a plan or the ability to actually pull it off
7062493 obviously joyce pulled it off and then some it turned out to be an awesome project and really stunning results i smile every time i drive past her house

7062505 sir tele and i saddled up flashy and beonarges to go to the moors and visit the cavorite mines as i had not been before we roamed the dark interior marveling at its sights at one point he ate a small piece of cavorite why i do not know and i feared poisoning or something to that effect thoughts of having to call dr bloodwing crossed my mind but he was fine those highlanders are made of rather strong stuff indeed
7062506 as one of god knows how many places doing something for the harry potter mania last night we attended a couple of dances with a magical theme
7062507 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7062508 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7062509 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7062510 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7062511 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7062512 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7062513 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7062514 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7062515 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7062516 the police told me that some cases are particularly difficult
7062517 they want to identify their loved ones soon so they can go home people are anxious to begin the grieving process
7062518 we dont want more psychologists we want someone to tell us what happened

7062523 anonymous is too ill to do anything right now and we need help right away
7062524 its been quite a while since my last girls with guns post so i have some catching up to do since my last post on the subject ive been concentrating on collecting 19th century weapons for victorian era and wild west sims
7062525 another murder has happened in new babbage the body of giles canning was found earlier today along the canals by ms ordinal malaprops factory the bow street police are currently investigating the scene we have came across some disturbing letters and clues that lead us to believe this murder wont be the last citizens of new babbage and visitors please be on alert we will update our findings as we proceed with the investigations
7062526 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7062527 starting next month well be taking reservations for the underwater sim residential and the babbage port commercial
7062528 earlier i mentioned the new caledon regency map returning to guvnah shangs mansion the next day i noticed a few added property owners on the floor map and another new map on an adjacent wall
7062529 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7062530 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7062531 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7062532 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7062533 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7062534 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7062535 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7062536 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7062537 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7062538 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7062539 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

7062541 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7062542 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7062543 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7062544 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7062545 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7062546 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7062547 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7062548 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7062549 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7062550 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7062551 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7062552 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7062553 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7062554 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7062555 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7062556 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7062557 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7062558 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7062559 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7062560 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7062561 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7062562 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7062563 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7062566 im thrilled to be back in new york with such a hilarious play
7062567 when i first read it i laughed out loud for me this is one of those old fashioned comedy
7062568 im so happy to be a part of this warm and funny play
7062569 luigi has written three one act comedies with characters that we can all identify with theyve been kicking around for a while but they are still living life and learning how to love one another this is a show with a lot of laughs and a lot of heart
7062570 pirates came from all nationalities and background but during the golden age of piracy most were welsh there were many irish and english pirates few scots french and spanish pirateering was widespread there were also a lot of runaway black slaves know as cimarron spanish for maroon and there were several famous black pirates such as diego grillo and lauren de graff
7062571 he instilled disciplines in his ministers and because of this the country has taken a new direction in terms of development he tirelessly fought corruption and brought sanity in the running of government affairs
7062572 though he was not in good health from the time he became president he was dedicated to duty
7062573 it is bad that we have lost a leader who had a vision for the country said duncan silwimba a lusaka city gardener
7062574 as president of zambia president mwanawasa launched a sweeping anti corruption campaign and dedicated himself to improving the welfare of all zambians
7062575 a great loss to the african continent and for democracy
7062576 it is a great loss for democracy for which he was an ardent defender for all his life france salutes his memory vibrant with courage and freedom
7062577 for the deepening of regional economic integration intensification of regional infrastructure development as well as the restoration and strengthening of regional political unity and cohesion
7062578 it is true that there is political anxiety because investors do not know who will be the next leader and whether the current policies will continue
7062579 the key issue must be to ensure that there is stable management of the resources we currently have
7062580 because of the good economic fundamentals brought by the late president
7062581 it will be a mistake for any investors to consider pulling out
7062582 good policies put in place by this government have resulted in our economy being stable
7062583 i havent been very sociable over the past weekend but i really have a good reason really im a new land owner w00t with parcels in antiquity cove and caledon regency first and foremost a special thank you to caledon guvnah desmond shang for everything he does for his citizens in providing us with an incredible number of sims 19 now and growing
7062584 la bicyclette branch in antiquity township i was enjoying a stroll in antiquity township when i walked past antiquitys branch of la bicyclette i decided to locate the busy proprietress of la bicyclette miss virriginia tombola prior to the antiquity opening and she graciously agreed to a brief interview about her business establishment
7062585 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7062586 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7062587 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7062588 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7062589 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7062590 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7062591 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7062592 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7062593 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7062594 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7062595 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7062596 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7062597 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7062598 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7062599 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7062600 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7062601 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7062602 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7062603 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7062604 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7062605 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7062606 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7062607 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7062608 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7062609 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7062610 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7062611 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

7062613 and it has been a very good qualifying for myself and the team after some unlucky races
7062614 the pace of the car here in valencia is not as bad as it was before but we are missing a bit of time to ferrari and mclaren that is all
7062615 only in qualifying two there were some drops of rain after corner 10 in the last part of the back straight but it didnt have any effect on me and our driving
7062616 how does it feel to have all that weight on your shoulders
7062617 this is where ive always wanted to be so i was going to wait for as long as it took i knew that if it didnt happen this fall it would happen in the winter it was just a matter of finding out when
7062618 i was excited to find out there was a spot for me this fall
7062619 it felt like i was walking on a cloud i feel like so many people probably wish they were in my position all i can do is go out work hard and try to show why my coaches had faith in me
7062620 there is always pressure to be perfect to develop some good consistency but if i keep working hard ill be okay
7062621 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7062640 we spoke with his wife and i know he suffered several compound fractures to a leg and arm

7062712 fay will be near or over the gulf coast of the western florida panhandle today and tonight and near or over the gulf coast of mississippi and alabama on sunday
7062713 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across the western portion of the northern florida peninsula the florida panhandle southwestern georgia and the southern half of both mississippi and alabama with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible
7062714 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7062715 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7062716 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7062717 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7062718 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7062719 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7062720 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7062721 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7062722 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region
7062723 its not easy to achieve this for me after hard work after so much effort
7062724 this does show us that what advocacy groups dont like is enforcement of the law
7062725 i think we learned that the most effective means of restoring integrity to the nations immigration system and to make this country safe from vulnerabilities is enforcement of immigration laws
7062726 to call the effort halfhearted would give ice half a heart too much credit

7062812 nick im ersten teil hast du es mal wieder spannend gemacht im zweiten gab es dann applaus vom team wie hast du das wahrgenommen
7062813 das zweite qualifying ist gut gelaufen da war ich nur mit ein paar hundertsteln abstand dritter spannend war es aber wieder speziell im ersten qualifying ich kam mir vor wie im falschen film und dachte mir das kann ja wohl nicht sein dass das zweimal hintereinander passiert genau wie in budapest habe ich zweimal meine fliegende runde angefangen aber da waren autos im weg timo glock anm d red hat mich offensichtlich wieder nicht gesehen leider wie gestern ich dachte es ist aus aber mit den harten reifen hatte ich zum gl ck noch eine zweite runde
7062814 wirst du mit timo ber die situation sprechen als er dich aufgehalten hat oder hakst du das ab
7062815 beides nat rlich wird man sich das noch mal anschauen die stewards werden das auch tun trotzdem muss ich mich auf morgen konzentrieren ich verstehe nicht wie so etwas passieren kann ich will da jetzt nicht nur timo die schuld geben denn bei uns im team l uft es so wenn ich rausfahre bekomme ich direkt von einem ingenieur gesagt dass ich ein schnelles auto hinter mir habe auch den abstand anscheinend passiert das bei einigen teams nicht
7062816 du kannst aber wieder l cheln ist eine qualifikation wie heute gut f r das selbstbewusstsein
7062817 ja es ist wichtig f r einen selbst aber auch nach au en hin dass man zeigt dass der speed da ist es klappt mit sicherheit noch nicht oft genug denn ich habe immer noch ein bisschen probleme aber wenn es denn mal passt und ich die reifen halbwegs ausnutzen kann dann denke ich sieht man dass der speed da ist
7062818 inwiefern kann man das heutige qualifying als aufw rtstrend im vergleich zu ungarn sehen
7062819 ich glaube ungarn war gar nicht so schlecht es sah nat rlich bescheiden aus dass ich nicht ins zweite qualifying gekommen bin die pace ber das wochenende war aber in ordnung das ist meine meinung wenn jemand eine andere haben m chte sei es ihm geg nnt aber so war es f r mich de facto hier hatte ich das ganze wochenende mehr probleme als zuletzt habe es dann heute aber zum gl ck hinbekommen wir haben von gestern auf heute das auto recht stark umgebaut es klappt f r mich noch nicht immer auf den punkt genau das maximum herauszuholen aber wenn es wie in q2 klappt dann sieht man dass die pace da ist q3 war auch in ordnung der abstand nach vorne ist nat rlich gro aber ich denke dass ich eher zu den schwereren autos geh re
7062820 valencia ist eine neue strecke wie siehst du die berholm glichkeiten
7062821 berholm glichkeiten sind leider in der formel 1 immer beschr nkt im vergleich zu anderen stadtkursen ist es aber hier nicht schlecht der achte platz ist nicht perfekt aber ich denke mal f r die spritmenge die ich an bord habe ist es in ordnung ich habe jarno trulli anm d red vor mir stehen der das feld oft ein bisschen aufh lt auch wenn es nicht mehr so schlimm ist wie vor ein paar jahren der toyota ist auch st rker geworden aber ich denke ich bin in einer guten position noch den einen oder anderen platz gutzumachen
7062822 the damage and loss of life that weve already seen from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm can be devastating dangerous and deadly
7062823 a lot of us are certainly suffering from fay fatigue but weve got to stay focused this is a big storm and its causing a lot of damage all over the state
7062824 the situation is very serious i can tell you i have commitments to export 30 million rupees 392 000 of rice this month to uae
7062825 i just cant do it because no truck is available to carry the rice from the warehouse to the port
7062826 we will continue our strike until the demands are met it is difficult to bear the expenses its impossible

7062831 we have now had a week to kind of let all this settle in
7062832 what role if any did the drivers have in this
7062833 a threshold was cracked on monday when barack obama mentor state senate president emil jones announced his retirement and then said he wants his heretofore unheard of son emil jones iii to replace him
7062834 voted present a third of the time he was in the senate
7062835 maverick was against offshore oil drilling before he was for it
7062836 bring a wealth of experience judgment and leadership to the office of the vice president
7062837 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election
7062838 ours is different from video because their final product looks exactly the same
7062839 we want people to see these stories through as many distribution points as possible
7062840 were still quibbling about what the primary form of revenue will be
7062841 we dont want to do anything to hurt anybody in the short term
7062842 the goal is to make it complementary to dating sites
7062843 thats okay most of the time they dont see you
7062844 dry climate in many chinese cities coupled with bad air quality also lead to the build up of mucus in ones respiratory tract hence generating phlegm
7062845 a lot of it is just bad habit some people spit even when there is no phlegm and what they spit out is in fact saliva
7062846 but saliva is part of your normal secretion and aids digestion its just a wrong idea that people have
7062847 as an individual i cant care too much about the countrys affairs to be honest who cares
7062848 the japanese distributor of the new film babel is warning audiences that the movie may cause nausea or headaches
7062849 gaga communications has received 15 complaints since the film starring brad pitt and cate blanchett opened saturday across japan
7062850 ive never seen anything like this ive suspected it forever but ive never seen it
7062851 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7062852 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7062853 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7062854 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7062855 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7062856 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7062857 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7062858 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7062859 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7062860 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7062861 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7062862 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7062863 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7062864 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7062865 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7062866 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7062867 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7062868 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7062869 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7062870 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7062871 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7062872 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7062873 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7062874 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7062875 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7062876 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7062877 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7062878 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7062879 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7062880 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7062881 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7062882 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7062883 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7062884 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7062885 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7062886 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7062887 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7062888 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7062889 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7062890 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7062891 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7062892 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7062893 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7062894 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7062895 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7062896 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7062897 before i turn in actually you dont have to make funny faces whenever you take picture x

7062910 its easier to measuring things now than later when your business is much more complicated
7062911 since there was no value in collecting that data point we dont track it anymore
7062912 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7062913 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7062914 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7062915 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7062916 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7062917 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7062918 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7062919 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7062920 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7062921 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7062922 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7062923 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7062924 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7062925 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7062926 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7062927 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7062928 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7062929 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7062930 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7062931 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7062932 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7062933 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7062934 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7062935 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7062936 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7062937 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7062938 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7062939 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7062940 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7062941 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7062942 this is a planning took where all things are going
7062943 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7062944 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7062945 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7062946 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7062947 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7062948 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7062949 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7062950 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7062951 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7062952 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7062953 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7062954 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7062955 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7062956 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7062957 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7062958 mariah carey has reportedly called off her second wedding to new husband nick cannon
7062959 there was no information in relation to the investigation that would support the laying of any charges so the case is closed at this point but as with any investigation if any information is brought to our attention then well review it at that time

7062993 one of the funniest experiences i had when i began working in the art world is that people always assumed i worked for thelma golden not that i was thelma golden the kind of dismissal that comes from just peoples sense that they dont imagine you are who you are actually has been one of the most powerful and liberating things for me in my work
7062994 theres always going to kind of be an overreaction one way or the other regarding your presence be it good or bad
7062995 what you tend not to see are films on black people radiating in the pleasure of their success and telling their stories
7062996 you come to the point whenever you see a black person on television its either a comedy or some tragic issue being spoken to you wouldnt think that black people could get through a competently managed day let alone being successful at it
7062997 it cant be all over as long as we have young african american boys and girls who are not able to get the quality education they need
7062998 or are still being held back because people are looking down on them
7062999 almost all of the african american writers that i know were very much uninterested in one area of the world which is white men
7063000 that frees up a lot it frees up the imagination because you dont have that gaze you know and when i say white men i dont mean just the character but i mean the establishment the reviewers the publishers and the people who are in control so once you erase that from your canvas you can really play
7063001 i said once i am the most underestimated eight time grand slam champion ever
7063002 its a lot more than just hitting the ball as hard as you can
7063003 its all about strategy and moving your opponent and just really figuring them out like i never get credit for mental and i just its you know frustrating but at the end of the day i am very happy with me and im very happy with my results
7063004 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7063005 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7063006 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7063007 our student population here is about 52 percent hispanic and 48 percent anglo and by state law we pretty much have to keep it that way or risk losing state funding
7063008 what were doing right now seems to work really well for the kids why would we change that
7063009 we almost never get to strike two the parents come and get them and we never see them again
7063010 ponytails rat tails mohawks or corn rows are not permitted
7063011 no student may have geometric or unusual patterns shaved or cut in hair including eyebrows and hair color must be any natural hair color
7063012 tattoos of any kind including temporary tattoos are discouraged and must be covered at all times
7063013 we have no art or music programs no vocational training and no football athletic program
7063014 we are a rich school district but it doesnt mean we are rich in property taxes we are poor in numbers of kids
7063015 we see most of those applications for kids beginning the sixth grade or other middle school years
7063016 our graduation rate is 100 percent and our drop out rate is zero

7063022 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong

7063024 in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7063025 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7063026 poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7063027 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
7063028 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
7063029 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

7063040 its bad enough that employees who exercise their right to refrain from union membership are forced to pay fees to a union they do not want

7063113 paul zarembka is a professor of economics at the state university of new york at buffalo
7063114 i am writing to follow up on recent serious allegations regarding the creation of a false letter from tahir jalil habbush saddam husseins former chief of intelligence to saddam hussein
7063115 the letter which was allegedly backdated to july 1 2001 attempted to establish an operational link between al qaeda and saddam hussein in the period before the 9 11 attacks by specifically stating that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had received training in iraq
7063116 at the time of the alleged decision in 2003 to concoct the false letter the vice presidents office had been reportedly pressuring the cia to prove this connection as a justification to invade iraq
7063117 upon careful review of the allegations concerning this matter i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
7063118 the law specifically provides that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
7063119 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
7063120 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
7063121 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
7063122 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
7063123 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
7063124 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
7063125 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
7063126 my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
7063127 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
7063128 i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found
7063129 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr suskind in his book i do speak to discussions regarding using habbush which were frequent during that period but what i was talking about was the possibility of using him to tamp down the insurgency not to influence western public opinion
7063130 the fabrication of a letter as claimed by mr suskind would have been much more than a non event
7063131 an order such as the one outlined by mr suskind would have been a huge event and in my opinion illegal an order to fabricate such a document would have been rejected out of hand and it is improbable to believe anyone would write such a request
7063132 the suskind account states that two senior cia officers robert richer and john maguire supervised the preparation of the document under direct orders coming from director george tenet not so says my source
7063133 tenet is for once telling the truth when he states that he would not have undermined himself by preparing such a document while at the same time insisting publicly that there was no connection between saddam and al qaeda
7063134 richer and maguire have both denied that they were involved with the forgery and it should also be noted that preparation of such a document to mislead the media is illegal and they could have wound up in jail
7063135 who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
7063136 the pentagon has its own false documents center primarily used to produce fake papers for delta force and other special ops officers traveling under cover as businessmen
7063137 it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
7063138 was inappropriately performing intelligence activities of developing producing and disseminating that should be performed by the intelligence community
7063139 what sibel revealed to us and has been revealing little by little since january is that she has heard that there was a nuclear procurement ring operating inside the us to procure nuclear designs and parts for the aq khan network and it was done not through pakistani intelligence directly but through the turkish embassy
7063140 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

7063153 one of our other buildings is only half booked and weve had people ring and ask if there were going to be bikies in the building
7063154 ive told them yes and a few have said well make it next weekend

7063157 violence is an issue for all schools government catholic and independent the community as a whole and parents right across australia
7063158 many teachers are at the coalface of a number of community related issues where parents and carers are reacting to issues such as financial hardship mental health issues and drug related issues
7063159 sa schools do not tolerate bad behaviour and use suspension and exclusion measures where required
7063160 teachers are having to deal with a number of social issues and behavioural disorders without the support they need
7063161 when you have children who are prone to violence or have adhd or aspergers you have to have the support there at schools to manage that
7063162 ive had scissors thrown at my head by a student
7063163 were told to always remain where people can see us
7063164 we want to investigate these things to not only deal with the incident but to prevent reoccurrences
7063165 we also look at crime prevention through environmental design things like lighting more open space and not having long narrow corridors between buildings
7063166 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7063167 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7063168 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7063169 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7063170 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7063171 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7063172 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7063173 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7063174 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7063175 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7063176 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7063177 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7063178 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7063179 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7063180 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7063181 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7063182 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7063183 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7063184 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7063185 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7063186 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7063187 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7063188 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7063189 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7063190 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7063191 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7063192 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7063193 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7063194 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7063195 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
7063196 daar kan ik momenteel nog niet op antwoorden ik raad u aan om de website in het oog te houden

7063200 they are difficult because we are dealing with in some cases events that have occurred up to 50 years ago
7063201 witnesses memories are incomplete in some circumstances and the investigations are sometimes complicated by the fact records have often been destroyed or are difficult to locate
7063202 the ptf has a mandate to fully investigate these matters and provide victims with the appropriate levels of service
7063203 victims can be assured that their matters will be thoroughly investigated and where possible the matters will be put before the courts
7063204 most of the victims are aware these are difficult matters to prosecute and we keep in constant touch with them
7063205 while they are difficult we have had a number of significant convictions from these types of investigations
7063206 added to the publicity surrounding the mullighan inquiry and because of the convictions we have achieved there is a renewed confidence in the community victims can come forward with allegations of historical abuse

7063209 biden denunciou a falta de crit rio de obama em pol tica externa e com suas pr prias palavras argumentou que os americanos agora v em que barack obama n o est preparado para ser presidente
7063210 penso que possa estar pronto mas agora neste momento n o acho que esteja a presid ncia n o algo que se pode aprender durante sua oucpa o

7063220 it would be highly disappointed if the champions trophy is not held here because we have spent so much time money and energy in ensuring its successful hosting cricket fans in pakistan who were deprived of top quality action because of australias decision against visiting pakistan earlier this year for a full test and odi series will once again suffer if the champions trophy is taken away from here
7063221 we fear a negative call from the icc though efforts are still on to somehow convince all competing teams to play in pakistan

7063227 he is good in the slot running routes running hook routes and doing some good things
7063228 it just worked out that way there werent a whole lot of passes thrown to be honest with you the numbers might reflect it 15 out of 30 is not the most accurate percentage in the world and we need to get it spread around and get the ball in their hands
7063229 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7063230 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7063231 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right

7063245 starting from pole here for the first time is very nice
7063246 here it is not very easy the surface is very slippery so to make the perfect lap is difficult
7063247 i had a good lap and was able to secure the pole position i think i have a good car for the race tomorrow which will be very difficult but well try to do our best
7063248 i made the pole position in the first sector which was fantastic
7063249 i made some very small mistakes in sector two and i had a good sector three
7063250 we saw the lap times improving so quickly compared to the first

7063265 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7063266 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7063267 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7063268 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7063269 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favor of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers

7063279 wir wussten dass wir ein gutes auto haben und es gab im qualifying keine probleme
7063280 ich kam sehr gut zurecht und entschied mich f r die weicheren reifen option meine erste runde war nicht perfekt und ich verlor im vergleich zu meiner zweiten fast eine sekunde aber bei meinem letzten run lief es optimal
7063281 der zweite platz ist eine gute ausgangsbasis f r das rennen allerdings war felipe massa im ersten sektor deutlich schneller und ich hoffe dass wir uns hier noch steigern k nnen unser team arbeitete super und ich bin optimistisch f r morgen
7063282 ich war mit der balance meines autos zufrieden und ich wurde im verlauf des qualifyings immer schneller
7063283 ich machte keine fehler und fuhr absolut am limit deshalb bin ich ber den f nften platz etwas entt uscht auf der saubereren seite der strecke will ich morgen gut starten und so viele punkte wie m glich sammeln mit unserer strategie sollte ich im rennen ein paar pl tze gutmachen k nnen
7063284 lewis und heikki zeigten erneut eine gute leistung mit starken rundenzeiten die auf ihre unterschiedlichen strategien hinweisen
7063285 wir sind also f r den ersten grand prix auf dieser tollen neuen strecke gut vorbereitet alle fahrer agierten heute beispielhaft bei schwierigen bedingungen gab es keine mauerkontakte
7063286 wir hoffen dass es im rennen ebenfalls keine zwischenf lle geben wird und dass sich diese veranstaltung in valencia zu einem st ndigen und beliebten grand prix im formel 1 kalender entwickelt ich gratuliere allen beteiligten besonders den verantwortlichen in valencia mit entsprechender f rderung kann dieses rennen zu einem hnlichen spektakel werden wie monaco
7063287 ein sehr spannendes qualifying auf dieser vollkommen neuen und beeindruckenden rennstrecke
7063288 danke an alle beteiligten f r ihren tollen einsatz in so kurzer zeit ich denke wir sind gut f rs rennen ger stet mal sehen wer von den top fahrern morgen den l ngsten ersten turn f hrt lewis und heikki zeigten eine gute leistung auch wenn lewis im ersten sektor leider mehr zeit verlor als ihm jetzt auf die pole position fehlt ein klasse job von sebastian vettel und toro rosso kompliment

7063299 i remember i played at something like four in the afternoon it was great actually it was really good
7063300 i was so excited about it and i think that came across and people started to really enjoy the track
7063301 i think ive been to all 10 years of creamfields so its kind of a coming home and you can really feel the passion of the promoters for the festival
7063302 i think its quite groundbreaking in rock and roll terms for us to do this
7063303 itll be nice because people who might not neccesarily go to creamfields will come and see us and check out some other music that they might not normally check out
7063304 well i know tom and serge and they describe themselves as a classic rock and roll band but i listen to their music and i hear stuff i can dance to
7063305 tastes are changing all the time and they are a huge band
7063306 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me
7063307 after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and in q3
7063308 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7063309 on this new and demanding track robert had a great qualifying again and fought his way through to p3 on the grid nick improved in the second part of qualifying and made it into q3 with the third best time overall his last lap wasnt perfect as he lost some time in the second sector anyway eighth is good what these positions are worth we shall see tomorrow during the first pit stops we had no technical problems during qualifying

7063318 la diferencia fundamental entre los mcs de antes y los de ahora es que los de antes eramos hip hop al cien por cien no s lo porque prob bamos con todas las disciplinas sino porque cre amos en que era una obligaci n estar instruido dentro del movimiento nos aprend amos quien era qui n aunque no lo fu semos a escuchar nunca ahora se visten de raper compran tres discos y ya forman parte del rap les falta ese poso de cultura hip hop que nosotros s tenemos
7063319 un d cimo lbum se hace con mucho cari o y es que tengo m s ganas de las que tenia cuando empec ya que ahora es cuando me he dado cuenta del que el rap es como un amigo con el que puedo hablar todos los d as y de cosas distintas porque nunca se te acaban los temas no quiero dar un paso demasiado r pido ya que lo importante es que el disco salga lo m s perfecto posible
7063320 quiero que sea muy rap en el sentido de que est enfocado en el rap est ndar aunque tambi n quiero enriquecerlo luego con instrumentos quiero que suene muy musical pero centr ndome sobre todo en el bomo y caja cl sicos por lo que respecta a la tem tica del disco yo siempre intento darle a mi rap un toque positivo reconociendo por supuesto que el mundo es una mierda no me gusta quedarme en el des nimo sino que me gusta pensar que a trav s del trabajo y del esfuerzo se puede obtener lo que quieras todo por encima de los temas en particular

7063326 a vote for selina is a vote for moving coquitlam forward
7063327 biden brings to the table a wealth of washington experience and like obama he has the ability to reach across party lines he complements obamas agenda and leadership and biden offers a balance to the ticket
7063328 joe biden brings a great deal of experience to the ticket he is a well thought of person very knowledgeable one of the key points is hes not a yes man thats what all candidates need someone to counter balance them and give them critical advice and at times when they differ express that your regular citizens who get up and go to work everyday surely thats universal for him across the country hes a guy although hes a u s senator hes a guy the average working man can relate to that helps across the spectrum
7063329 i do not see what fit that pick makes it doesnt make a lot of sense to pick a person who only helps you with one thing i see biden helping obama with the whole national security piece but i dont see it beyond that i dont see him helping him with the place i see a real problem and im going to call them the hillary voters not necessarily whether they voted for hillary or not but that person who helps with the working class middle class crew i dont see biden bringing them in and thats my big worry
7063330 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to senator obama
7063331 great pick will help in georgia and throughout the country biden had great appeal to independents and when i was canvassing in iowa for obama there were many very interested in biden he also reflects change together with experience
7063332 i am thrilled it makes it even more exciting knowing that joe biden will be the vice president he has all the qualities that we need in a candidate knowledge experience and love of public service he seems to be a very straightforward and honest person what a delightful change from our current administration

7063340 with riverbend being a little further outside the city of eugene our ambulances are having to travel farther to get to the hospital
7063341 and now because thats the primary hospital were transporting to our units are not available to handle calls in eugene and response times are greater because we have to travel from springfield back into eugene
7063342 as time goes and crews work longer and longer hours it becomes more of a fatigue issue
7063343 we may have to shift our deployment of ambulances move them to a different location if were out of service that much longer
7063344 the patients who show up at university district will be taken care of by emergency physicians and get immediate care
7063345 if they need to go to riverbend theyll be transported
7063346 i think the medics have done an excellent job i also understand their need to do as few transfers as possible because they want to be in their community in eugene for the next 911 call
7063347 we appreciate the new construction and the fact that this project will create more housing and a generally higher level of activity in that area of downtown
7063348 westtown on 8th has been a real exciting project to work on
7063349 first the project helps meet the need for affordable housing downtown second the residents will make a contribution to downtown economic development particularly in the west broadway area
7063350 the need is so great for affordable housing in this community
7063351 its very safe and i dont have to worry about anything
7063352 they wanted this to be a well received building by the community even though its affordable housing and there were budget limitations
7063353 by doing the low scale building on the front it doesnt feel like a large mass of a building when you approach it
7063354 we concluded that it was better to keep the sound in rather than for us to deal with
7063355 it was a demonstration of their commitment to what were trying to do with affordable housing downtown

7063417 is this a choice that will bite obama in the butt
7063418 mr obamas selection ended a two month search that was conducted almost entirely in secret it reflected a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change
7063419 on foreign policy and national security an area where john mccain regularly assails obamas lack of experience democrats offer few more seasoned practitioners than biden
7063420 on the democratic side it was a collective phew as the days got nearer for the pick it was hard to find a democrat even savvy clintonites who werent hoping it would be biden only the most strident hillary supporters appear to be upset this morning on the gop side the sound you heard was disappointed silence of everyone on the short list the candidate many republicans least wanted to see obama pick was biden
7063421 balanced against all of those unmatched qualifications is one quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things over the next few days and likely weeks some of bidens ungreatest hits of gab will be recycled by the media and republicans aiming to take the luster off obamas choice of running mate
7063422 obama biden works on several fronts a longtime sentimental favorite among the democratic faithful delaware sen joe biden provides a comfort zone for labor leaders catholics he is one and national security voters although bidens poor fundraising skills doomed his presidential campaigns he performs extremely well in debates and demonstrated considerable skill at shifting from the arcane language of the senate chamber to the street language of the campaign trail
7063423 time will tell if barack obama made the right choice in picking joe biden but if you look at it on paper it makes a whole lot of sense
7063424 obama biden will be a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama

7063444 if we do not change course in iraq soon youre going to see two years from now helicopters hovering over our embassy in the green zone in baghdad with people hanging
7063445 my sense is that we have achieved tactical momentum and wrested the initiative from our enemies in a number areas of iraq we are in short a long way from the goal line but we do have the ball and we are driving down the field
7063446 general petraeus or general betray us cooking the books for the white house
7063447 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake

7063454 now that obama has chosen a well respected senator with impeccable foreign policy experience
7063455 speculation is that mccain will counter with an equally impressive choice which i believe will be the person dick cheney tells him to pick
7063456 its a misplaced emphasis to count on who the running mate will be to secure a win in november
7063457 you need to count on who is counting the votes in november to secure that victory

7063475 stewart i just stumbled upon this post while tracking a link to your website magazine article on 5 effective wiki uses this is a great series very informative and very helpful the examples provide some great ammunition for someone wishing to implement a wiki or for someone looking for the right tool and are discovering

7063494 i guess the main thing i want to say is what a pleasure its been to share this tradition with you for lo these many years and as for writing metaphors something i noticed this year theres a point in the process when regardless of past success im filled with doubts its that step when you put the berries in a pot with the sugar and corn starch and lemon juice you turn on the heat and the instructions say to cook until the liquid thickens and the berries soften but it just looks so dry for a few minutes there it is dry its impossible to imagine that its going to turn into something juicy and i kind of push the mess around with my wooden spoon wondering until without fail the magic occurs a complete transformation into something deep and blue and beautiful and bubbling i have my crust anxieties too of course whether it will hold together and so forth but that dry mix in the pot im telling you

7063506 there are not over a hundred people in the united states who hate the catholic church there are millions however who hate what they wrongly believe to be the catholic church which is of course quite a different thing
7063507 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
7063508 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
7063509 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law
7063510 support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
7063511 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
7063512 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
7063513 leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing
7063514 which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious
7063515 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
7063516 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather with the concern of the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
7063517 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
7063518 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities
7063519 ought not christ to have suffered these things and so to enter into his glory

7063524 i had finished reading atlas shrugged by ayn rand and i went out looking for a childrens book series that taught business my daughter was just an infant but i wanted something that would teach her less about being an employee and more about the different areas of business because i felt like she needed a different education about it than i had growing up which was that you strive to be an employee not a business owner
7063525 after searching in stores and on the internet and not being able to find what i was looking for i decided to write it myself

7063569 i got very scared and i wondered what causes this and how can this be stopped so i started looking in to it and i found out that mangroves are the best way to stop this from happening again
7063570 imagine what mangroves do for us when they are not cut they prevent soil erosion they are a barrier between the land and the sea and they prevent surge storms
7063571 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
7063572 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis
7063573 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
7063574 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
7063575 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
7063576 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource
7063577 when peoples access to clean drinking water is reliant on the profit interests of a handful of transnationals all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty

7063584 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7063585 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
7063586 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7063590 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
7063591 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
7063592 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7063593 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7063594 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7063595 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defence foreign affairs and oil revenues
7063596 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7063597 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7063598 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilisation against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centrepiece of their iraq strategy
7063599 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7063600 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints

7063753 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives
7063754 it is imperative that we exercise caution before jumping to any conclusions the issue of civilian casualties is so important that it is vital that we verify the facts of what has actually happened
7063755 it is a matter of great concern that we are seeing reports of large numbers of civilian casualties the first rule of any counter insurgency operation is to do no harm
7063756 it helped having ruby there not just for warmth but for moral support as well

7063781 i will ensure that any matters arising from the inquiry will be duly acted upon and will engage with state and territory governments in their areas of responsibility
7063782 if she wants to come back we will embrace her but if it is her desire to stay whereshe now is we will only wish her well
7063783 let us hope that the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped
7063784 but if they have then we will have a moral responsibility to do the right thing
7063785 and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
7063786 i dont think that we should have knee jerk responses that suggest that the commonwealth should automatically take it over
7063787 so lets just wait until we get the outcome of the inquiry before people start to say well if the commonwealth takes it over that will solve all the problems
7063788 by the full and proper recognition and protection of its indigenous cultures
7063789 for what it has acknowledged responsibility for the attempt to destroy us as a race of people by taking away our children

7063799 these allegations were all regarding changing a withdraw fail grade to a withdraw grade as a courtesy to students

7063835 i want biffa the boys at the very top not to try to cover anything up or hide anything
7063836 come clean and then sort yourselves out and make sure this never happens again
7063837 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7063838 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7063839 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7063840 a good qualifying session very close and made even more uncertain because of the weather a first and a fourth place is a good outcome even if it could have been better felipe did two great laps in q3 while kimi missed out by a whisker on being able to start from the clean side of the track in fact the start will be one of the decisive moments of the race tomorrow it will be important to try and pick up as many points as possible with both drivers we have a car that is competitive over a long run and we will try and exploit that as well as possible we must pay careful attention to managing all the possible scenarios that arise as on all street circuits the risk of a safety car period is always hanging over the race
7063841 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and in q3
7063842 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake apparently this isnt the case in every team i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7063843 on this new and demanding track robert had a great qualifying again and fought his way through to p3 on the grid nick improved in the second part of qualifying and made it into q3 with the third best time overall his last lap wasnt perfect as he lost some time in the second sector anyway eighth is good what these positions are worth we shall see tomorrow during the first pit stops we had no technical problems during qualifying
7063844 this was a very exciting qualifying in the first part there were some rain drops and in the second part the times were close its positive that we were able to get both cars into the top ten qualifying nick drove a very fast lap in q2 and was able to qualify easily for q3 robert also had a very strong performance starting from p3 he is in a very good position for the race and nick will also have his chances im pleased all the hard work we have done since the race in hungary has paid off
7063845 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7063846 i am disappointed with my qualifying and i could probably have set a better time this afternoon i dont think our result shows our true pace because fernando also failed to reach q3 when we both had the potential i will now work with my engineers and prepare for an aggressive race to move up through the field tomorrow
7063847 considering all the preparation involved for this new circuit its very disappointing not to have any of our cars in the final part of qualifying i am sure we had the potential to do so but potential is not an ultimate result however im sure it will be an interesting race tomorrow in the event here several weeks ago we saw that the safety car can play an important role and we will think hard about our strategy to try to make the most of our situation
7063848 our position at the end of qualifying is disappointing especially as we thought we had done some good work yesterday and seen some encouraging results but all is not lost and we will try and develop a strong strategy that will allow us to make the most of grid positions
7063849 its been a few races since we managed to get into the top ten so this is a good result for us wed obviously always want to do better but this shows weve made a step in the right direction and thats satisfying we had a better understanding of where we had to improve so weve made those changes which gave us a more competitive car today we have a good strategy for the race so anything is possible today has been positive which gives me hope for points tomorrow
7063850 it was a good qualifying for us as both cars are close in the midfield it was a shame to miss out on q3 but actually p11 is not a bad place to start the race from because we can select our fuel level ill also be on the clean side of the track tomorrow so all in all it was a positive qualifying session for us
7063851 its good to have at least one car in q3 which weve missed for quite some races both drivers did a good job unfortunately kazuki just missed out on his first q3 by the smallest of margins the important thing now is to prepare for the race and make sure were happy with our strategy were looking forward to tomorrow
7063852 weve struggled for speed for most of the weekend its a new venue here which brings variety to the positions but we dont seem to have the pace we had a few races ago which is quite frustrating there were a few laps i was pleased with but we didnt make it through to q3
7063853 i expected to be able to make it through that first part of qualifying on my last run i ran wide in turn 5 and dropped about four tenths although i pulled two tenths back the net loss over the whole lap meant it wasnt enough to go through its just the way these qualifying sessions go that was probably one my messiest sessions and im disappointed
7063854 a very disappointing qualifying we seem to have struggled for pace here all weekend despite having been very fast in the last sector and its frustrating for the drivers to finish in 14th and 17th an incident filled race is the only way were likely to achieve any points this weekend so well wait and see congratulations to toro rosso who got both their cars into the top ten for the first time
7063855 a bad day and a bad result it was bad beginning to the week with the plane crash in madrid and the death of dino toso chief aerodynamicist for renault which puts things in perspective but life goes on and coming back to our present work we have to work like hell now to bounce back from here we already need to be thinking about the next race in spa
7063856 after our difficult practice yesterday we completely changed my set up for today then we had a gearbox oil pump problem this morning that meant i could not try it out so in a way i was driving blind this afternoon but i used my experience i concentrated very hard and i made it through into q3 i made a mistake on my last run but i am still very happy with what we achieved today im also delighted with the way the car is developing and the fact that we can always fight for the top ten and score points that is again our target tomorrow its important and realistic and it will be an interesting race here more than anywhere anything can happen and it should be a great event
7063857 i dont know what went wrong but i just didnt get the lap together in the second session and that was that we definitely had the chance to be higher in the top ten but it was a difficult qualifying in the end for me the prime tyres seemed to work better but i struggled to get temperature into the tyres in the first sector of my last lap in q2 so it was just not my day today i had a heavy cold overnight and didnt feel particularly well but no excuses i think the car was good enough but it just didnt work out of course we will do our best to make up positions tomorrow there could be safety car periods so we will aim to make the most of our freedom with the strategy
7063858 altogether it has been a very difficult day and a disappointing qualifying result yesterday we had a very competitive friday especially with timo and now things have turned around jarno did a fantastic job because he could not run in p3 this morning due to a gearbox oil pump problem but that did not stop him and all his laps apart from his last lap in q3 were very good for timo today was not as successful as yesterday he was on the pace in q1 but q2 did not go as expected so we will have to investigate what happened after the overnight rain the track was green again today but the tyre situation is clear the positive thing for us is that we are in good position to defend against safety cars tomorrow and make sure that both cars are not caught out by the same safety car period
7063859 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix its been a fantastic day for us we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive the team worked hard to make the most of the data we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7063860 we must be doing something right but im not sure what it is seriously though this is our best qualifying performance with sebastien making his first appearance in q3 as we got both our drivers into the final part the fact this is a new track meant we didnt have to pay our usual tax in terms of our drivers lack of experience as it was the same for everybody we brought a few new things here and everything worked so we can be happy
7063861 it was a really disappointing qualifying today particularly as we have been quick all weekend my first run on the prime tyres was good but we simply chose the wrong tyre for my final run in q1 i had no grip with the option and it just wasnt very competitive for us my final run was slower than my prime run which shouldnt happen on a circuit which is improving all the time im really disappointed as we have improved the car but today we didnt make the most of that
7063862 it has been an incredibly frustrating day for us today we were not able to find a balance on the car in practice this morning which affected our preparations for qualifying this afternoon i particularly struggled with rear locking which cost me a lot of time as i wasnt able to attack the lap its very disappointing to be starting the first race here from so far back on the grid
7063863 our free practice pace was genuine and we have definitely made some improvements to the car over the break and here this week today i felt we could have had one car in the top ten rubens has been struggling with the car all day and we never really managed to overcome those problems jenson however had the car working very well as we saw with his first run in qualifying when he was using the prime tyre he then switched to option tyres but they didnt work at all for him and he could not match his early time with the mid pack being so close he was just squeezed out of q2 contention from our grid positions the race will certainly be a challenge if the car is working well tomorrow the drivers will be up against slower cars ahead and we think overtaking is going to be difficult however race incidents are likely here it could be very tricky off line and as we have seen from the other series there are places from which cars are difficult to recover so safety cars are a real possibility we now need to focus on making our strategy as robust as possible to ensure we are well placed to take advantage of any opportunities
7063864 i really tried my hardest on that lap i think i got the maximum out of the car and the best time we could do and in the end we are only 1 3secs from the fastest time of the session it just shows how close everything is now but i dont think we could have done anything more it was a fantastic effort from the team and the car felt good it could be an unpredictable race tomorrow so lets see how it goes
7063865 the first run was ok the track was improving and the grip level was getting better with every lap on the second run i had a good lap except for a small mistake in turn 14 where i lost two to three tenths but it was still not bad then on the last run i had some problems with the traffic on my out lap and couldnt warm up the tyres so they werent ready for the first couple of corners so i locked up in the first corner thats why i couldnt improve my lap time which was for sure disappointing as the final run is always the quickest and i couldnt improve my time so last on the grid lets see for tomorrow
7063866 i think a good effort from the team and giancarlo got the maximum out of the car in qualifying its the first race with our quick shift box and i think we have clearly taken a step forward in competitiveness and its nice to start out qualifying some of the works cars in the progress i am very proud of the team now we are just 1 3secs from the fastest time of the day and really pushing to move into the midfield for tomorrows race we know there will be a lot of incidents and potentially a lot of safety cars but we know our race pace is normally better than our qualifying pace so i think we can genuinely race with the midfield and look for a potential opportunity to score
7063867 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope well be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
7063868 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7063869 today we saw another very good afternoons work from both lewis and heikki characterised by strong lap times that reflect their respective race strategies all in all therefore were well prepared for the first grand prix to be held on this exciting new racetrack all the drivers did an exemplary job today in fact avoiding the walls in the tricky conditions we hope that tomorrows race will be equally incident free and that in time the valencia event will become a regular integral and much admired element of the formula 1 calendar i would like to offer our congratulations to all concerned and to the valencia authorities in particular with appropriate promotion this grand prix promises to become a fabulous adjunct to our sports existing harbour side spectacular namely monaco
7063870 a very exciting qualifying session here on this completely new and impressive circuit thanks to everybody involved for doing such a superb job in such a short period of time i think we are well prepared for the race and it will be interesting to see which of the frontrunners will drive the longest first stint tomorrow both lewis and heikki did a good job even if lewis unfortunately lost more time in the first sector than he is now behind the pole time our german friend sebastian vettel and his toro rosso team showed a great performance today really well done

7063959 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7063960 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7063961 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7063962 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7063963 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7063964 cheney has essentially been called a co president or by some critics a secret president
7063965 the president of vice president has become much more powerful and certainly anyone who would be looking at taking the number two position on the ticket would certainly think i might have a broader portfolio i might have the opportunity to have a real impact on the administration policies
7063966 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
7063967 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials

7063972 your mom has it and you can open it after i leave
7063973 dear nanny i dont know what we would do without you love the xes
7063974 i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7063975 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well
7063976 the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game i shall talk to the player on sunday he is our player and we shall work with him at training
7063977 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7063978 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7063979 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7063980 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7063981 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7063982 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7063983 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7063984 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7063985 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7063986 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7063987 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7063988 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7063989 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7063990 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7063991 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7063992 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7063993 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7063994 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7063995 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7063996 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
7063997 entrei aqui na internet e me deparei com fotos da mulher fil na praia a mulher fil somente uma das carnes do meu rod zio adoro onde isso vai chegar
7063998 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7063999 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7064000 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7064001 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7064002 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7064003 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7064004 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7064005 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7064006 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7064007 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7064008 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7064009 ah ah thats a catch question with a brain your size you dont think right
7064010 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7064011 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7064012 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7064013 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7064014 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7064015 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7064016 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7064017 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7064018 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7064019 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7064020 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7064021 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7064022 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7064023 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7064024 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7064025 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7064026 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7064027 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7064028 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7064029 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7064030 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7064031 er was veel vraag van de fans die eindelijk zweinstein wilden onderzoeken die wilden echt alles zien in het kasteel toen we de game maakten hadden we dit in ons achterhoofd gehouden zonder het verhaal van de film uit het oog te verliezen maar de spelers kunnen kiezen in welke volgorde ze de vele verschillende missies willen spelen eerst moet je de hp wereld doorzoeken om de gevers te vinden van de taken missies en dan n g verder zoeken om de taken missies van hen te volbrengen een ander belangrijk item voor fans is dat ze de mogelijkheid hebben om met magie te werken dit betekent niet alleen een toverspreuk doen op specifieke locaties die nodig is bij je missie het betekent ook dat je de betoverde kant van het kasteel ontdekt je kan dus toverspreuken afvuren op elk ding in de hp wereld en het zal reageren
7064032 wat zijn de voornaamste plaatsen van de film waarop je je gericht hebt
7064033 we hebben alle plaatsen waar de film zich afspeelt in de game verwerkt klein zanikem en de aanval van de dementors grimboud plein fred en george die ontsnappen uit zweinstein en al de actie in het ministerie van toverkunst we hebben ook diverse missies rond de kamer van hoge nood in de game geplaatst
7064034 kan je in deze game met een ander personage samenwerken
7064035 deze game concentreert zich op n speler je kan w l missies in deze game uitvoeren als een ander personage b v fred en george sirius zwarts en perkamentus
7064036 het geven van toverspreuken werkte heel goed in de game van hp en de vuurbeker is er veel veranderd in de nieuwe game op dit gebied
7064037 we houden zeker de fysieke magie in de game die we hebben uitgewerkt vorig jaar met enkele duidelijke verbeteringen je krijgt in deze game 6 verkenningsspreuken en 7 vechtspreuken
7064038 we hebben ons erg gericht op de playstation 2 omdat de meeste kopers van onze games dit systeem hebben op de playstation 3 n de xbox 360 versies is het een veel mooiere en rijkere grafische belevenis en de wii versie ziet er helemaal fantastisch uit met dit systeem richt je je helemaal op de bewegingen die je maakt voor de toverspreuken die je doet als je de wii afstandsbediening gebruikt voor de eerste keer is het n t alsof je echt je toverstok kan gebruiken
7064039 felipe ist brillant gefahren gestern war er mit dem auto nicht sehr zufrieden aber die jungs haben ber nacht gearbeitet und offensichtlich einen gro artigen job gemacht felipe hat das dann ideal umgesetzt

7064042 notions de r ussite et d chec dans la filiation adoptive
7064043 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7064044 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7064045 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7064046 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7064047 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7064048 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7064049 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7064050 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7064051 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7064052 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7064053 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7064054 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7064055 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7064056 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7064057 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7064058 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7064059 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7064060 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7064061 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7064062 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7064063 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7064064 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7064065 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7064066 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7064067 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7064068 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7064069 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7064070 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7064071 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7064072 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7064073 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7064074 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7064075 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7064076 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7064077 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7064078 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7064079 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7064080 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7064081 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7064082 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7064083 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7064084 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7064085 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7064086 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7064087 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7064088 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7064089 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7064090 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7064091 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7064092 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7064093 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7064094 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7064095 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7064096 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7064097 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7064098 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7064099 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7064100 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7064101 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7064102 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7064103 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7064104 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7064105 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7064106 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7064107 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7064108 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7064109 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7064110 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7064111 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7064112 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7064113 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7064114 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7064115 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7064116 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7064117 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7064118 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7064119 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7064120 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7064121 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7064122 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7064123 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7064124 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7064125 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7064126 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7064127 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7064128 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7064129 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7064130 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7064131 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7064132 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7064133 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7064134 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7064135 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7064136 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7064137 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7064138 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7064139 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7064140 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7064141 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7064142 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7064143 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7064144 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7064145 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7064146 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7064147 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7064148 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7064149 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7064150 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7064151 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7064152 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7064153 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7064154 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7064155 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7064156 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7064157 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7064158 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7064159 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7064160 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7064161 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7064162 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7064163 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7064164 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7064165 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7064166 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7064167 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7064168 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7064169 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7064170 for our country it london august 23 itar tass ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said his country has to move towards the nato alliance for our country it is the only way
7064171 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games
7064172 the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7064173 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7064174 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7064175 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7064176 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7064177 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7064178 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7064179 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7064180 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7064181 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7064182 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7064183 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7064184 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7064185 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7064186 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7064187 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7064188 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7064189 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7064190 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7064191 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7064192 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7064193 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7064194 tekkon kinkreet at my friends house but no one wanted to i think they wouldve liked it i know i did nino did a terrific job as a voice actor and so did yu aoi
7064195 son a manll sweet talk and give ya the big eye but when the sweet talkins done a mans a two face a worrisome thing wholl leave ya to sing the blues in the night
7064196 we all love ella celebrating the first lady of song
7064197 when buying and selling are controlled by legislation the first things to be bought and sold are legislators
7064198 i have not selected him as i do not think that he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7064199 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7064200 i shall talk to the player tomorrow he is our player and we shall work with him at training
7064201 we have 11 days left before the transfer deadline and we are working at something but you never know in football
7064202 it may happen it may not if it doesnt we will carry on with what we have got
7064203 slowly emerging from the state of sedation in which he fell following his mild heart attack
7064204 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7064205 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it i am fully aware he has got his thing on sept 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
7064206 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7064207 we do different things when i have two friends that fall out i try to help i dont sit here and make the other friend feel left out
7064208 when you guys are hanging out ill just move to another place i dont want to be around her period point blank
7064209 i need to be cool and start enjoying myself im going to be nice to everyone i need to stop shooting myself in the foot
7064210 im not going to let a girl who came in halfway be my downfall
7064211 my consultant said the cancer had got so big it filled half my womb there was a chance it was in my bloodstream
7064212 she told me id need a hysterectomy radiotherapy and chemotherapy the biggest shock was when i asked what would have happened if id stayed in india for three months
7064213 without hesitation she replied jade you would have died ive got to make a joke about it or ill go mad with the fear if i go bald ill get a big tattoo on my head and i refuse to question whether or not i will die its not an option ill fight with all my strength
7064214 im sitting here desperately trying to come to terms with the fact that i might die while people are out there accusing me of making my illness up
7064215 call me a racist call me a bigot a chav whatever but dont call me a liar over this
7064216 freedom from outside interference and the right to self government
7064217 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7064218 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7064219 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7064220 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7064221 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7064222 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7064223 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7064224 you treat it like a regular season game because you are going to be out there longer
7064225 i am out there trying to get better its a preseason game but its time to see where we are at as a team
7064226 i have a better understanding of what we are trying to do offensively it was a tough situation last week when i only had two days at the same time its getting better i dont want to say i am fully getting the offense but i am getting the offense to the point where i know where the ball needs to go and what we are trying to do i am looking forward to it because i have a week to prepare instead of two days i am anxious and excited to go back out there on saturday
7064227 we have to get used to the people that are in there
7064228 we are shuffling people around there are some new faces we have to get a feel for the line and get comfortable with the set line it really doesnt affect me it makes me better some offensive linemen do things different or better than others so it keeps me on my toes how i make my reads
7064229 russlands anrainer und ihre angst vor den russen im eigenen land
7064230 let not our longing slay the appetite of our living
7064231 almost the only scoffers at prayer are those who never tried it enough
7064232 i f only mortals would learn how great it is to possess divine grace how beautiful how noble how precious how many riches it hides within itself how many joys and delights no one would complain about his cross or about troubles that may happen to him if he would come to know the scales on which they are weighed when they are distributed to men

7064234 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7064235 love is passion obsession someone you cant live without if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with fall head over heels i say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back and how do you find him forget your head and listen to your heart im not hearing any heart run the risk if you get hurt youll come back because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you havent lived a life at all you have to try because if you havent tried you havent lived
7064236 it came as a shock to a lot of his close friends
7064237 i only saw them four times a year and they were a loving couple
7064238 to every guy that was never too busy to drive across town or across the state to see her
7064239 to every guy that gives flowers and a card when she is sick
7064240 to every guy who has given her flowers just because
7064241 to every guy that said he would die for her
7064242 to every guy that did what she wanted to do
7064243 to every guy that hugs her for no reason at all
7064244 to every guy who would give their jacket up for her
7064245 to every guy that calls to make sure she got home safe
7064246 to every guy that would sit and wait for her for hours just to see her for ten minutes
7064247 to every guy that reassured her that she was beautiful no matter what
7064248 to every guy that tried to show how much he cared through every word and every breath
7064249 to every guy that thought maybe this could be the one
7064250 to every guy that would have done anything so she could achieve them
7064251 to every guy that never laughed at her when she told him her dreams
7064252 to every guy who prays that she is happy even if you are not with her
7064253 to every guy who doesnt care how far away she lives he will still date her
7064254 somente hoje nada te responderei mas vou ouvi lo com muita aten o e prometo pensar mais no assunto e depois voltaremos a nos comunicar

7064256 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7064257 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7064258 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7064259 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7064260 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7064261 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7064262 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7064263 know ye not this parable how will you know all parables
7064264 i know reading log is quite a new concept here however in the states its quite common therefore i am introducing this to you in this course
7064265 you are not allowed to discuss the papers with your classmates i want to see your personal opinion and this is your individual work
7064266 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7064267 we are obviously very concerned about reports that russia may be providing weapons weapons systems to syria
7064268 we have always said to the russians that these sales should not go forward they dont contribute to regional stability and again i urge them not to go through with these sales if there is an intent to go through with them
7064269 you have to do a lot of groundwork before you can proceed its frustrating that a lot of people seem to think this is all a fun and game business and the city is out there trying to shut down bachelor parties
7064270 were talking about drugs and violent crime all next to a residential neighborhood
7064271 what i saw in my audit was serious potential for abuse of power benefits given without policies and procedures in place
7064272 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7064273 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7064274 you never know what you dont know but we have spent more time planning and training than i think any city in history for a national convention

7064291 es una emoci n ver a la audiencia que vamos a llegar a pek n con los juegos paral mpicos de 2008

7064293 me alegra mucho estar nuevamente con ustedes los atletas que han merecidamente conquistado el honor de llevar la bandera nacional a la competencia deportiva m s importante del mundo
7064294 me llena de satisfacci n el nombrarles representantes de m xico en los juegos paral mpicos beijing 2008 y sabemos muy bien que pondr n muy en alto el nombre de m xico
7064295 hace poco menos de un a o me reun con ustedes para celebrar los grandes triunfos que le dieron a m xico en los juegos parapanamericanos en r o de janeiro conf o en que su participaci n en la paraolimpiada va a ser igualmente exitosa
7064296 nuestros mejores representantes deportivos porque cubren a m xico de gloria y dar como los grandes atletas que son todo de s en la competencia
7064297 admiramos su capacidad para superar la adversidad para poner siempre la mirada sobre el nuevo reto y alcanzar nuevos triunfos

7064299 por eso el gobierno federal est y estar con ustedes con miras a su participaci n ol mpica hemos apoyado a su esfuerzo respondimos a una demanda justa de nuestros deportistas paral mpicos al crear por primera vez en la historia un programa de becas especial para ustedes
7064300 hemos apoyado con casi 30 millones de pesos para el entrenamiento de nuestros atletas para estos juegos paral mpicos
7064301 s bien que adem s de destinar recursos hay muchas tareas que debemos atender s que se necesita dar mucho mayor apoyo al deporte en todas su reas
7064302 se necesita mayor promoci n para que podamos detectar talentos mayor difusi n para que la gente practique m s el deporte requerimos m s infraestructura para que m s mexicanos practiquen el deporte de manera cotidiana
7064303 mientras los mexicanos no hagamos del deporte una pr ctica cotidiana no podremos alcanzar los lugares que m xico merece por el tama o de su poblaci n y la juventud de su gente
7064304 una manera de combatir la inseguridad es precisamente rescatando espacios p blicos y abriendo oportunidades para el deporte para los j venes abriendo alternativas para la pr ctica del deporte como un sano esparcimiento como un instrumento de disciplina personal y de formaci n f sica y espiritual adecuada
7064305 para lo cual tenemos que ampliar de manera decidida las capacidades para la pr ctica del deporte en las escuelas los barrios y rancher as por razones de desarrollo personal y humano por razones de seguridad de saludad tendremos que hacer del deporte en m xico una pr ctica cotidiana accesible para todos
7064306 precisamente es as como combatimos no s lo a trav s de la persecuci n de los delincuentes sino tambi n a trav s del combate a las causas sociales de estos problemas que queremos superar

7064349 n s obviamente sempre queremos andar melhor por m o desempenho de hoje mostrou que demos um passo na dire o correta e isso promissor sab amos onde precisav mos melhorar assim fizemos algumas mudan as e ficamos com um carro competitivo
7064350 um pouco de tudo falta um pouco de aerodin mica um pouco de motor
7064351 o carro acaba ficando com pouco grip dianteiro traseiro um pouco de tudo nessas horas n o adianta voc mexer em muita coisa porque se melhorar de um lado piora de outro acertar o carro uma pista sem grip realmente muito dif cil
7064352 l gico vamos tentar ao m ximo acho que d sim para ultrapassar tem bastante reta e chance de acontecer bastante coisa
7064353 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7064354 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7064355 is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7064356 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy

7064372 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7064373 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7064374 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7064375 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7064376 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7064377 mijn lieve hemel wat kun jij het jezelf moeilijk maken je wilt zoveel je voedt allerlei wegen en dan zie je werkelijk je missie niet meer denken en voelen lopen dan door elkaar heen en zo raak je op momenten je doel en jezelf kwijt
7064378 this forest is old my friend full of memory and anger
7064379 o carro anda muito pouco na reta perco 6 km h em rela o a meu companheiro de equipe ent o voc fica completamente vendido nessa situa o e sofrendo muito como balan o nas freadas travando roda traseira o que n o est ocorrendo no outro carro
7064380 ent o voc imagina perder quase um segundo para o carro da equipe uma situa o que n o deveria nem ser permitida e n o d muito para explicar
7064381 talvez at tenhamos de tirar o carro do grid de largada para largar dos boxes para tentar fazer alguma coisa n o uma afirma o uma possibilidade
7064382 tentamos deixar o carro o mais parecido poss vel com o de button para que pudesse basicamente repetir a performance do outro carro mas com 6 km h de reta perco quase dois d cimos em cada reta e aqui s o quatro ent o vai parte do meu segundo nisso no meio da curva n o perco muito perco mesmo em aproxima o de freada e em reta
7064383 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
7064384 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
7064385 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
7064386 er ist ein unbeherrschter charakter und muss sich zusammenrei en
7064387 im not trying to be pat white and im sure pat whites not trying to be nick sheridan or steve threet
7064388 coach has made that public that were fighting every day
7064389 because of his athleticism and size and the fact he started for three years in our program we all knew hed be starting somewhere for a good program
7064390 kevin has officially opened up his recruitment and is going to reevaluate everything
7064391 not that he doesnt care for michigan we still think its a possibility
7064392 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7064393 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7064394 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7064395 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7064396 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7064397 in our sport we dont have photo finishes like in athletics in our sport its who touches first water is a different element
7064398 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7064399 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7064400 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7064401 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7064402 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7064403 while barack obama and the democrats continue to shift economic positions and pass the largest tax increases in american history john mccain has consistently fought against washingtons pork barrel spending and proposed a real plan to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses
7064404 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7064405 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7064406 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7064407 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7064408 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7064409 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7064410 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7064411 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7064412 ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top
7064413 because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can
7064414 the best way that the industry can help is to do a few simple things add a warning entry page with no images and require some form of age verification such as larry walters birthdate verifier and add the rta meta data code to your websites
7064415 this is important for many reasons including the fact that the industry does not want children to view its content and if sites are labeled with rta it gives control to parents to determine what content they want their children to view by using a parental control system such as the parental control bar
7064416 last but not least if the industry does not self label the government will either make it mandatory or start to look at other solutions such as the xxx tld
7064417 the expectation by the government and prosecutors is that adult websites are responsible for making sure minors do not access adult websites unfortunately current technological solutions to achieve that result are limited
7064418 ultimately the issue will be resolved by bio tech solutions like fingerprint or retina scans but for now the best solution seems to be to put the burden back on the user to ensure that some consequence is attached to accessing a site that is restricted in some way
7064419 we developed a way to use two different federal laws as a means to generate an electronic affidavit of age rendering the user liable for perjury if a misstatement of age is presented
7064420 such access would also make the user potentially liable as a hacker or trespasser when appropriate terms and conditions are tied to the birthdateverifier form
7064421 it would be difficult for the government to find an underage witness who could competently testify that he or she gained access to content protected by the birthdateverifier since that witness would have committed perjury and already demonstrated a propensity for false statements under oath
7064422 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
7064423 what good is sitting alone in your room come hear the music play

7064428 when minard came home before the holiday he had no idea that the borough was going to honor him
7064429 proud that he could have served the country his feelings are still the same way he wishes he could go back and fight for his country
7064430 he has tremendous will power and is walking on his prosthetics
7064431 he was home last month when we had brooke baptized he was able to stand on his prosthetics for the ceremony he is pushing really hard to get better
7064432 kayla is getting ready for kindergarten she knows that her father is a hero and is very proud of it
7064433 he is an inspiration to all the young people in the borough
7064434 it is a our privilege that he has chosen union beach as his home
7064435 we never imagined that so many people would turn up at the dinner last year
7064436 people actually waited in line to thank minard for his service it was truly touching
7064437 when we built our home we wanted it to be our castle
7064438 and every castle has a title so we named it after our children
7064439 our home is unique and reflects what i can do
7064440 thats why i named my business after the home anything that comes out of deithaynia is deithaynian
7064441 i used to work on creative projects on my time off and learned a lot of skills from people who believed in me
7064442 then in 2001 i decided to change my profession and become an enhancer full time
7064443 four generations of my family worked in the decorating trade
7064444 my father encouraged me to join the union as a young man and taught me his secret skills and tricks of the trade that made me a very sought after worker and also helped to keep me out of trouble when i was young
7064445 i had friends that are gone forever friends who are maimed forever and you wonder how long you have before your ticket comes up
7064446 you have your home built put a roof on it get the structural things ready and i take it from there
7064447 i will do the hardwood flooring molding creative sidings inside stucco outside stonework and other decorating details if you decided you want to create a theme with your home whether it be victorian gothic or country i will bring your vision to life
7064448 from my childhood i had a natural talent of taking things apart and putting them back together differently to make something new
7064449 i became good at what i call enhancements taking a pile of nothing and creating with it i experimented in tile stone wood and painting all these things i learned from my father and from the union i always had a knack for creating a new vision of things
7064450 it was a little intimidating in the beginning to be trusted to create somebodys dream vision
7064451 but i was always able to answer the challenge thrown at deithaynian creations the more projects i was asked to do the more confident i became of myself and of what deithaynian creations could do
7064452 i get so wrapped up in what i am doing i get so involved in any given project that i dont want to get distracted with anything else
7064453 also i believe now as i did when i started the company that to be overwhelmed by yellow page advertising and a web site would detract me from giving my full attention to the person i am working for at the time i dont want to do 200 estimates at deithaynian creations we take up each project as we are referred to them and spend the time to create what the person we are working for wants to get done
7064454 my wife when we were building our house wanted a victorian i wanted a tudor so we created a victudorian
7064455 its our own hybrid and our unique approach to things trying to fit all elements into what we want to do
7064456 everyone has ideas and needs we try to give shape to their ideas and create what they want and bring that to life
7064457 we are just proud to be trusted with the job i have become friends with the families and the people i have worked for
7064458 my pig is a pet she is not dirty or smelly
7064459 what would we say that potbelly pigs are the only animal allowed
7064460 its just frustrating the ordinance mentions rabbits and how many people have rabbits in town i mean come on
7064461 get into the habit of dealing with god about everything unless in the first waking moment of the day you learn to fling the door wide back open and let god in you will work on a wrong level all day but swing the door wide open and pray to your father in secret and every public thing will be stamped with the presence of god
7064462 the poplars of izmir losing their leaves they call me the knife lover like a young tree i blow stately mansions sky high
7064463 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7064464 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7064465 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7064466 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7064467 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7064468 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7064469 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7064470 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7064471 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7064472 when the building was built we were assured it didnt need air conditioning because the designers and builders were very confident that the temperatures would stay within the regulations with an upper limit of 28c
7064473 but we regularly had temperatures of over 30c and some of the consulting rooms on the south side have been up to 32c or 33c
7064474 it is hard to work in those temperatures and for patients to feel comfortable
7064475 weve had lots of complaints it is a disappointment from the design point of view
7064476 during our original design review it was considered that mechanical ventilation would provide a comfortable waiting environment for patients and that additional cooling was not necessary
7064477 it is now apparent that during periods of prolonged hot weather this is not the case and we are taking steps to rectify the problem by providing solar reflective film to glazed areas and mechanical cooling to the waiting areas

7064479 thank you mr oates if youll just take a seat the inspector will be with you shortly
7064480 the name is oatenshaw i want to see inspector lestrade
7064481 now mr oates sir theres no need to get excited well have a look for your inspector oatenshaw
7064482 my name is oatenshaw i have come here to see inspector lestrade
7064483 well ill be blowed oatenshaw what in the name of god has brought you to this pretty pass
7064484 are you quite sure youre allright why dont you come along with me and well sort this out in no time at all
7064485 but dont ysee man moriarty is letting us know the location of these heinous crimes in advance theres absolutely no time to lose
7064486 that moriarty is inventing that damn puzzle in the news
7064487 its quite clear that moriarty has taken over the evening news crossword with the express intention of making a monkey of the forces of law and order
7064488 five across yesterdays edition dont mind admitting got the better of me
7064489 and only a man of considerable and specialized knowledge would have been able to decipher his infernal mission the fact of the matter is that the sophistry brought to bear upon this apparently innocent puzzle has turned it from a harmless passtime into a potentially lethal great scott
7064490 well lestrade it was deuced fortunate that i happened along what
7064491 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction a security official said
7064492 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts said abdifatah ajos sanura a director at the shamo hotel where the pair stayed
7064493 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped sadia mohamed said
7064494 es wird etwas dauern bis ich wieder da bin geh bis dahin nicht aus dem haus ich warne dich dort drau en lauern gefahren versprichst du mir dass du nicht hinausgehst
7064495 oh your father is at temple and ill really have to ask him what he wants to do
7064496 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7064497 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7064498 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7064499 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7064500 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7064501 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7064502 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7064503 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7064504 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
7064505 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7064506 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7064507 if you trust every web site but not a government
7064508 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7064509 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7064510 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7064511 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
7064512 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
7064513 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
7064514 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7064515 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses
7064516 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7064517 look we know we have an incomprehensible messy system that even we ourselves barely understand but instead of actually fixing the problems and making our operating systems better well just staple another layer on top to hide the ugliness
7064518 saya ingin lulusan sekolah di sini bisa menjadi pemimpin di negeri ini nantinya
7064519 saya ingin sekolah ini terus jalan kasihan banyak orang berharap bisa melanjutkan sekolah gratis di sini
7064520 we are hoping for the best while getting prepared for the worst
7064521 it would be highly disappointed if the champions trophy is not held here because we have spent so much time money and energy in ensuring its successful hosting cricket fans in pakistan who were deprived of top quality action because of australias decision against visiting pakistan earlier this year for a full test and odi series will once again suffer if the champions trophy is taken away from here
7064522 we fear a negative call from the icc though efforts are still on to somehow convince all competing teams to play in pakistan
7064523 this is a major phenomenon which could put the whole cinema and audiovisual industry in danger
7064524 the number of subscribers to fast broadband connections is directly proportional to the trend of illegal downloads these fast lines enable people to make big downloads like films
7064525 i began to compromise my christian values partying and dating guys who werent christians
7064526 the turning point in my life the catalyst that propelled me further into an unhealthy lifestyle
7064527 es ist ein paar rennen her dass wir es in die top10 geschafft haben
7064528 also ist das ein gutes ergebnis f r uns es steckte nicht mehr drin im auto
7064529 es war schwierig zu fahren ich konnte nicht richtig attackieren
7064530 aber das auto hat sich nicht gut angef hlt war unangenehm zu fahren trotzdem waren wir im vergleich zur konkurrenz besser dabei
7064531 es ist wichtig dass wir immer mehr lernen es wird schwierig noch in diesem jahr gro e schritte zu machen aber wir verstehen jetzt fast komplett wo wir bei der aerodynamik falsch gegangen sind
7064532 sie haben mehr auf andere sachen geachtet deshalb mussten wir sogar einen schritt zur ckgehen
7064533 karena itu jangan heran perguruan adabiah yang dimotori kelahirannya oleh dr abdullah ahmad ulama dan tokoh pembaharuan pendidikan islam minangkabau banyak melahirkan tokoh tokoh berkaliber nasional dan internasional

7064538 everything from gas to groceries health care to has gone up
7064539 while barack obama and the democrats continue to shift economic positions and pass the largest tax increases in american history

7064543 ich fuhr am nachmittag also quasi blind aber ich habe meine erfahrung genutzt mich stark konzentriert und es bis q3 geschafft
7064544 wir k nnen jetzt immer in die top ten fahren und punkte holen das ist auch morgen unser ziel es ist wichtig und realistisch und es wird ein interessantes rennen hier kann mehr als anderswo alles passieren und es sollte eine tolle veranstaltung werden
7064545 wir hatten sicher die chance in den top ten zu sein aber es war letztendlich ein schweres qualifying f r mich waren die prime reifen besser aber ich hatte probleme im ersten sektor meiner letzten runde in q2 temperatur hinein zu bekommen

7064547 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries
7064548 we will announce our 2020 target for greenhouse gases next year
7064549 the target will reduce our emissions from business as usual
7064550 whether its an absolute reduction by 2020 or just a decline in the rise is still to be decided
7064551 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7064552 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7064553 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7064554 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7064555 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favour of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers
7064556 hopefully this will help the citizens in these communities feel a little more secure
7064557 i would like to express my appreciation to the people that have given my officers helpful information during this investigation
7064558 i would also like to express my appreciation to the all the officers for their dedication diligence and long hours they have put in
7064559 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7064560 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7064561 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
7064562 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7064563 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
7064564 its the worst thing that could happen having to stop at the olympics
7064565 ive never stopped any race since i began even when i fell or broke something i always finish
7064566 here it was a physical problem i couldnt do anything else
7064567 i got in a little trouble in the corner i was stuck inside and could not get out at the end of the day i have to be happy with the finish and the 10 year process to get here
7064568 our team has worked so hard preparing for these games and to get this result here tells us that were finally there being one step up in ranking and beating the americans proves to us that our country has greatly improved
7064569 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
7064570 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
7064571 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
7064572 church leaders teach important principles and invite our members to govern their lives by those principles we do not desire to compel them nor can we do so
7064573 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
7064574 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
7064575 i am so happy to have achieved this performance this year it was very special for me to win double at the olympics its fantastic
7064576 the 5 000 is very difficult because i came from the 10 000 days earlier

7064578 i was excited to be able to pull it out for us
7064579 when i came off the turn and made my final push she was still strong i knew it was going to come down to the wire the russians have great runners i kept focusing and pulled it out
7064580 im really proud of the team and the fact we ended on a high note
7064581 we have four of the top quartermilers in the world
7064582 we swept the 400 the 400 hurdles youve got three people himself taylor and wariner who have olympic gold medals i did my job its feels great i wanted to run well for the u s

7064667 catholics united believes senator bidens selection as vice presidential candidate is a positive development for americans who respect leaders who have strong religious family and personal values senator bidens well known commitment to his catholic faith has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women his faith has helped him to find solace during times of tragedy and crisis
7064668 we are optimistic that senator bidens history of seeking practical means of addressing abortion will help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate that has come to surround the issue senator biden accepts his churchs teachings on human life and can work to advance these teachings in ways that americans of all political persuasions can support
7064669 catholics united is especially hopeful that operatives on the far right will refrain from using senator bidens faith and the teachings of the catholic church as political weapons in the coming campaign faith and values should be used to unite americans behind solutions to the key challenges of this age war poverty lack of health care and a looming climate crisis and not as partisan wedges to divide voters

7064698 ik besef nog niet goed dat ik olympisch kampioene ben geworden dat klinkt als een clich zeker
7064699 dat ik het zo goed ging doen had ik niet verwacht in de buurt komen van mijn belgisch record dat was de betrachting na 2m03 stond ik derde op dat moment zat het tussen de oren heel goed lopen en springen dat was het enige waar ik aan dacht en dat verliep uitstekend of ik na 2m05 dacht dat het goud binnen was met vlasic weet je nooit h ze bleef vrij sportief na de nederlaag ja nu ga ik hier eens goed van genieten maar het zal mijn leven niet veel veranderen gewoon doen is al goed genoeg

7064768 siasia and his boys should be given a heroic welcome when they return from the olympics and all the members of the team should be compensated adequately and also honored
7064769 they have really done this country proud and i would tell you that i am so proud to be a nigerian
7064770 i know what it took siasia to nurture these boys to where they are today and we should be happy that he has done what we normally waste our funds to get from the so called expatriate coaches
7064771 these foreign coaches would come take huge amounts as salaries and remunerations and they will still fail to perform
7064772 but this guy siasia most times uses his resources to do certain things for his team not waiting for the authorities now he has reaped from his hard work
7064773 we all know the teams unimpressive build up and the problems they faced before now so we should commend them for even getting to the final
7064774 we should not fail to note the fact that there were major lapses or problems in the teams attack and defense in the final match against argentina but that is what football is all about

7064784 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

7064790 to address the breadth and depth that these changes to the endangered species act regulations will have on protecting our most imperiled wildlife
7064791 these regulations would reinforce the services current view that there is no requirement to consult on greenhouse gas ghg emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species e g polar bears
7064792 rather than a narrow tweaking of the regulations the proposal represents a back door attack on the endangered species act
7064793 the american people deserve and expect a full public process to vet such far reaching changes to this landmark conservation law
7064794 it appears as if the administration is doing whatever it can to discourage participation in the democratic process
7064795 i think we can expect more sneaky assaults like this on our public land and wildlife laws as this administration heads for the exits
7064796 for one of our nations most important and successful environmental laws the 30 day comment period is woefully inadequate for the public to review and comment on this critical proposal
7064797 the bush administration proposal eliminates the critical checks and balances needed to protect imperiled birds and cuts species experts from the process of making decisions that need to be science based
7064798 the endangered species act is a safety net for our nations wildlife fish and plants on the brink of extinction said bill snape of the center for biological diversity
7064799 the bush administrations proposed regulations will cut a giant loophole in the safety net
7064800 i got very scared and i wondered what causes this and how can this be stopped so i started looking in to it and i found out that mangroves are the best way to stop this from happening again
7064801 imagine what mangroves do for us when they are not cut they prevent soil erosion they are a barrier between the land and the sea and they prevent surge storms
7064802 from an environmental wasteland standing as a barrier between the buffalo community and the lake erie waterfront to a spectacular green space and recreational resource
7064803 the outer harbors makeover will help draw more people to the waterfront and stimulate further revitalization around one of buffalos greatest natural assets
7064804 the greenbelt preserves the waters edge for public park space makes adjacent land more attractive for future development and offers residents another new opportunity to enjoy buffalos waterfront
7064805 this project in conjunction with the outer harbor parkway project under construction now provides unprecedented access to this waterfront stretch
7064806 with this momentum in just 18 to 24 months residents will have what they demanded and deserve a completely transformed outer harbor with beautiful boardwalks bike and pedestrian paths recreational space fishing piers accompanied by an efficient and attractive roadway to take them there
7064807 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7064808 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7064809 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7064810 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7064811 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7064812 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7064813 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7064814 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7064815 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7064816 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7064817 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7064818 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7064819 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7064824 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
7064825 i believe in spinozas god who concerns himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings
7064826 i can not accept any concept of god based on the fear of life or the fear of death or blind faith i can not prove to you that there is no personal god but if i were to speak of him i would be a liar
7064827 its about keeping john mccain from sweeping the south thats the key
7064828 the economy and national security are neck and neck for me
7064829 in fact im not even sure they are separate issues
7064830 i just havent really understood what mccains position is on that but it needs to be controlled
7064831 senator obama has a great deal of work to do if he plans to turn the southern states in his favor
7064832 for older americans i think color is still an issue
7064833 obviously olympic sponsors have been more aggressive in their advertising strategy in the lead up to the games which has fleshed out to rmb6 6 billion in just the second quarter a significant 28 increase from the first quarter
7064834 an added complication in the sports category is local player and non sponsor li ning which according to earlier nielsen research enjoyed 29 consumer recognition as an olympic sponsor not far behind the 35 recognition for actual sponsor adidas
7064835 nielsens ais information indicates that li ning has avoided going head to head with global players in ad spending rmb 23 million in june but rather relies on gaining association through spokesperson arrangements with various athletes and other means
7064836 obviously the economy is a question mark for everybody but sports doesnt have much a of dvr issue around it people want to watch it as soon as they can not later olympics is still a safe harbor for ad dollars as are most sports

7064883 see even obamas vp thinks id be the better president
7064884 im trying to balance things out in my head on biden
7064885 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
7064886 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
7064887 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
7064888 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
7064889 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
7064890 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
7064891 d listed is calling barack obama joe biden the bambi ticket
7064892 i dont have to work today when i thought i might yay today im slackercoma
7064893 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7064894 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7064895 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7064896 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7064897 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7064898 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7064899 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7064900 sie trafen nicht mich aber die zwei lkws hinter mir
7064901 diese stra e war eigendlich sicher aber im letzten monat attackierten sie mehr und mehr
7064902 wenn die afghan army nicht da ist dann kommt keine fliege durch
7064903 die taliban versuchen die hauptstra en nach kabul zu unterbrechen um auf den nachschub f r ausl ndische truppen zu zielen genau wie es die mujahideen mit den sowjets taten wenn die stra en auch nur f r 2 tage unterbrochen sind kann das schon zu riots in der city f hren
7064904 er sagt auch die mullahs waren in allen d rfern und legten einen bann auf die einwohner nicht den briten zu assistieren und als konsequenz ist die muselmann bev lkerung wie nur ein mann gegen uns
7064905 die taliban werden kabul politisch und milit risch einkreisen um es f r nato forces schwierig zu machen logistische konvois zu erhalten
7064906 das bedeutet weniger nato bewegung und wird zeigen da wir rger in der hauptstadt machen k nnen
7064907 in keiner weise k nnen sie eine strategische bedrohung gegen ber der afghanischen regierung machen
7064908 uns geht es gut mit lebensmitteln und treibstoff mit der luftmacht die wir haben und der qualit t der bodentruppen ist es unm glich f r sie zu gewinnen
7064909 wenn sie mich erwischen werden sie mich in meinen eigenen container werfen mich mit benzin bersch tten und lebend verbrennen
7064910 i came out here ready i came out here prepared i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7064911 its a real question whether the state should be on the hook for that large an expenditure for someone who is going to be in office for such a short period of time
7064912 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 19 50 moscow time 1550 gmt
7064913 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone inside georgia have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
7064914 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7064915 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7064916 the russians want to have eight peacekeeping checkpoints outside south ossetia but that is not agreed with us or with international mediators so it is not russias right to decide unilaterally how many checkpoints will be here
7064917 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7064918 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7064919 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible
7064920 a purely circumstantial speculative argument but while its speculative its within the scientific bounds of reason
7064921 may very well be among the safest places to go during a seismic event
7064922 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7064923 tasty and easy recipes spanning breakfast to dinner and all points in between
7064924 in a country of primarily orthodox religion the fact that the head of the catholic church should be concerned in such a determined way about the ongoing conflict and that he keeps the georgian people in his heart and prays for them has caused a great impression
7064925 arrived suddenly and who didnt even have a mattress to lie on
7064926 there still is tension people cannot understand why despite the agreements everything is blocked and no one can go wherever he wishes
7064927 both the georgian government and the orthodox patriarchate have requested aid from the catholic church and we are doing everything possible with a great spirit of collaboration
7064928 in situations such as this it is important to feel united beyond differences of faith
7064929 saya tak mahu sumpah sebab ulama arab yusof qardhawi iaitu kawan baik saya ada telefon saya dia kata anwar ana sokong kamu kamu jangan susah hati ana dah buat solat hajat kamu jangan sumpah jangan bagi dna kamu ikut mahkamah syariah sahaja
7064930 kalau ulama mengatakan demikian mahkamah syariah itu adalah jalan saya saya dah rujuk mahkamah syariah sebulan sudah kerana saya nak ikut islam
7064931 la seducci n sectaria es una forma de seducci n narcisista en tanto que despliega un proceso tendiente a envolver y enredar cada vez m s al sujeto en la espiral del grupo prometi ndole un ideal a trav s de una adhesi n pasional y radical que se supone que operar como una suerte de transformaci n personal radical y trascendente a trav s de rupturas en las relaciones

7064948 gratulation an felipe massa und ferrari f r das erzielen der ersten pole position auf diesem aufregend neuen stra en kurs in der wundervollen stadt von valencia
7064949 das fahren heute war sehr interessant und wir haben gesehen wie sich die rundenzeiten kontinuierlich verbesserten als die fahrer und teams den kurs lernten und das haftungsniveau der strecke zunahm
7064950 die top 3 fahrer qualifizierten sich auf der super weichen mischung w hrend der viertschnellste fahrer die weiche verwendete es gibt also einen spielraum f r eine interessante strategie variation morgen
7064951 gratulation an toro rosso die mit sebastian vettel heute die schnellste zeit markierten und beide autos im qualifying in die top 10 gebracht haben dies ist ein schneller kurs und einer der uns morgen ein interessantes rennen bescheren sollte
7064952 its obvious theyre anticipating the upcoming season as well im hopeful that we can close out the remaining tickets in the next couple of weeks and have a complete sellout in season tickets which were very close to doing now we need all of them in there screaming like crazy at every home game
7064953 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7064954 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7064955 the lord knows the thoughts of the wise that they are futile
7064956 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours
7064957 theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7064958 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with over the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts it has put a lot of pressure on me
7064959 i had a bit of trouble shifting on the last climb and irina was right on my wheel i had to put a foot down she got by me and that was bronze
7064960 but coming to your first olympics getting fourth that was awesome
7064961 its the worst thing that could happen having to stop at the olympics
7064962 ive never stopped any race since i began even when i fell or broke something i always finish
7064963 here it was a physical problem i couldnt do anything else
7064964 i got in a little trouble in the corner i was stuck inside and could not get out at the end of the day i have to be happy with the finish and the 10 year process to get here
7064965 our team has worked so hard preparing for these games and to get this result here tells us that were finally there being one step up in ranking and beating the americans proves to us that our country has greatly improved
7064966 im used to finishing on top and im very fortunate and lucky to have that distinction
7064967 its a little bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i wanted its not a failure you shoot for the stars sometimes you only make it to the moon
7064968 mostly just because of the stress and the pressure that ive been dealing with over the past 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind its the kind of thing ive never dealt with before its a little victory for me today
7064969 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot which probably isnt the best way to deal with something like that
7064970 i didnt know what else to do i probably had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either i tried to read but i wasnt interested in what kurt vonnegut had to say yesterday or today which is strange because i usually eat it up
7064971 i said i wanted to be strong confident triumphant and the last one was adam
7064972 the amount of pressure that ive been dealing with for the past six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medallist and knowing that ive won a lot of races until now but they really dont matter once you get here because its this one that counts puts a lot of pressure on me and it has put a lot of pressure on me
7064973 he learned very early how to win gracefully and i was always very proud of that
7064974 hes i think dealing with not being no 1 as gracefully im proud of him still its a new thing he learned
7064975 the last 24 hours have been quite difficult whereas the 24 hours following my thousand performance in athens were elated and quite relieved and very happy and that contributed to my 500 performance
7064976 i guess could say similarly that the disappointment contributed to my 500 performance today in a very different way
7064977 i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it marnie mcbean former canadian rower told me to fight like a tiger and i tried to it was really tough thats why kenny passed me i was toast
7064978 my head kind of fell down and then i was like man if i dont see my name in third im going to i dont know try and disappear
7064979 and then second disappeared and my heart raced again i thought i was second i thought id crossed the line a metre in front of tim but you never know
7064980 cada vez estamos m s cerca de ferrari y mclaren
7064981 ha sido una clasificaci n estupenda he de felicitar a todo mi equipo porque el coche ha estado fant stico y cada vez estamos m s cerca de ferrari y mclaren
7064982 las ruedas se comportan bien aunque no hay demasiada adherencia as que vamos a intentar no cometer los mismos errores que en hungr a no es un secreto que fallamos estrepitosamente con la presi n de los neum ticos
7064983 hay varios sitios en los que se puede adelantar pero va a ser muy complicado porque pr cticamente todos estamos rodando en los mismos tiempos y es peligroso rodar fuera del carril limpio
7064984 espero mejorar porque nos hemos esforzado mucho en la preparaci n de este circuito
7064985 creo que ser decisivo mantener la posici n en la zona limpia del circuito desde la misma salida
7064986 he said he raised some points with the government and hoped to return in terms of concrete outcomes there was not much
7064987 so far as i heard she is not satisfied with the present condition during this visit of mr gambari
7064988 the right to life recognized by the constitution remains protected from the moment of conception
7064989 his economic plan is four more years of george bushs economic plan
7064990 four more years of record spending record deficits record giveaways to the special interests and a reckless disregard for the middle class
7064991 will lay out a new direction for jump starting our economy and rebuilding a strong middle class
7064992 everything from gas to groceries health care to college tuition has gone up
7064993 and well do this while bringing down the budget deficit cutting unnecessary spending and government waste in washington and responsibly ending the war in iraq
7064994 while barack obama and the democrats continue to shift economic positions and pass the largest tax increases in american history john mccain has consistently fought against washingtons pork barrel spending and proposed a real plan to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses
7064995 you shouldnt hate your mother she brought you to this world
7064996 we make too much money to have a playoff even though that is the right thing to do
7064997 she didnt really consider the consequences of coming on the show
7064998 i dont think big brother was really for her she was very brave to have come on and to have done it
7064999 i know shes not the easiest person to get along with but she felt that she really wanted to see me so much
7065000 she didnt think about it carefully enough and just came on to see me and im very proud of her that she did that
7065001 mr newell has done a better job of identifying mr silvers weaknesses mainly his devotion to closed door politics including his refusal to disclose details about his outside income mr newell is also pledging to support congestion pricing and to press for a nonpartisan redistricting commission which is essential for real change
7065002 a one legged hooker was killed in brooklyn after a john hit her over the head causing her to fall backwards out of her wheelchair and slam her skull against the wall investigators believe she had been servicing a client in the hallway who then hit her on the head with a heavy object
7065003 she wore a prosthetic leg but also used a wheelchair
7065004 we will take indica vista in six months to international market
7065005 of the 12 old variants six or seven still exist in the market
7065006 that is why i felt it was right for me to submit the resignation to the governor
7065007 after the turn of events in the last ten twelve days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation to the governor
7065008 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7065009 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7065010 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7065011 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7065012 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7065013 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7065014 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7065015 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7065016 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7065017 you play to win the game in the preseason because no one repeat no one wants overtime
7065018 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7065019 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7065020 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7065021 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7065022 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
7065023 do you think a significant portion of americans have permanently reprioritized their values as a result of sept 11
7065024 the red stone the goal of the work the fifth element the soul of the world the good the inner guide the object of ones goals
7065025 obama would make it by bringing a sen biden by his side
7065026 youre such a gentleman darren what happened to ladies first you couldnt wait to barge in then
7065027 itu karena adanya perbedaan pendapat di antara elemen umat islam apakah awal masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan itu ditentukan oleh ru yatul hilal melihat hilal ataukah dengan ilmu hisab
7065028 karena adanya perbedaan pendapat apakah di dunia ini hanya berlaku satu mathla tempat keluarnya hilal ataukah masing masing negeri mempunyai mathla sendiri sendiri
7065029 apa hubungannya antara ketaatan terhadap penguasa dengan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan
7065030 barangsiapa menaatiku berarti telah menaati allah barangsiapa menentangku berarti telah menentang allah barangsiapa menaati pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menaatiku dan barangsiapa menentang pemimpin umat ku berarti telah menentangku
7065031 di dalam hadits ini terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
7065032 seseorang hendaknya bershaum bersama penguasa dan jamaah mayoritas umat islam baik ketika cuaca cerah ataupun mendung
7065033 sebagian ahlul ilmi menafsirkan hadits ini1 dengan ucapan mereka sesungguhnya shaum dan berbukanya itu dilaksanakan bersama dan mayoritas umat islam
7065034 yang jelas makna hadits ini adalah bahwasanya perkara perkara semacam ini menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan berbuka puasa iedul fithri dan iedul adha pen keputusannya bukanlah di tangan individu tidak ada hak bagi mereka untuk melakukannya sendiri sendiri bahkan permasalahan semacam ini dikembalikan kepada penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam dalam hal ini setiap individu pun wajib untuk mengikuti penguasa dan mayoritas umat islam maka dari itu jika ada seseorang yang melihat hilal bulan sabit namun penguasa menolak persaksiannya sudah sepatutnya untuk tidak dianggap persaksian tersebut dan wajib baginya untuk mengikuti mayoritas umat islam dalam permasalahan itu
7065035 dan selama belum terwujud bersatunya negeri negeri islam di atas satu mathla dalam menentukan pelaksanaan shaum ramadhan pen aku berpendapat bahwa setiap warga negara hendaknya melaksanakan shaum ramadhan bersama negaranya pemerintahnya masing masing dan tidak bercerai berai dalam perkara ini yakni shaum bersama pemerintah dan sebagian lainnya shaum bersama negara lain baik mendahului pemerintahnya atau pun belakangan karena yang demikian itu dapat mempertajam perselisihan di tengah masyarakat muslim sendiri sebagaimana yang terjadi di sebagian negara arab sejak beberapa tahun yang lalu wallahul mustaan
7065036 inilah yang sesuai dengan syariat islam yang toleran yang di antara misinya adalah mempersatukan umat manusia menyatukan barisan mereka serta menjauhkan mereka dari segala pendapat pribadi yang memicu perpecahan
7065037 aku telah shalat di mina hari hari haji pen bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam abu bakr umar dan di awal pemerintahan utsman 2 rakaat dan setelah itu utsman shalat 4 rakaat kemudian terjadilah perbedaan di antara kalian sebagian shalat 4 rakaat dan sebagian lagi 2 rakaat pen dan harapanku dari 4 rakaat shalat itu yang diterima adalah yang 2 rakaat darinya
7065038 engkau telah mengingkari utsman atas shalatnya yang 4 rakaat mengapa kemudian engkau shalat 4 rakaat pula
7065039 jika awal masuknya bulan ramadhan telah diumumkan di salah satu negeri islam semisal kerajaan saudi arabia namun di negeri kami belum diumumkan bagaimanakah hukumnya apakah kami bershaum bersama kerajaan saudi arabia ataukah bershaum dan berbuka bersama penduduk negeri kami manakala ada pengumuman demikian pula halnya dengan masuknya iedul fithri apa yang harus kami lakukan bila terjadi perbedaan antara negeri kami dengan negeri yang lainnya semoga allah subhanahu wa taala membalas engkau dengan kebaikan
7065040 setiap muslim hendaknya bershaum dan berbuka bersama pemerintah negerinya masing masing hal itu berdasarkan sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
7065041 waktu shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban
7065042 umat islam di luar dunia islam sering berselisih dalam menyikapi berbagai macam permasalahan seperti penentuan masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan serta saling berebut jabatan di bidang dakwah fenomena ini terjadi setiap tahun hanya saja tingkat ketajamannya berbeda beda tiap tahunnya penyebab utamanya adalah minimnya ilmu agama mengikuti hawa nafsu dan terkadang fanatisme madzhab atau partai tanpa mempedulikan rambu rambu syariat islam dan bimbingan para ulama yang kesohor akan ilmu dan wara nya maka adakah sebuah nasehat yang kiranya bermanfaat dan dapat mencegah terjadinya sekian kejelekan semoga allah subhanahu wa taala memberikan taufiq dan penjagaan nya kepada engkau
7065043 umat islam wajib bersatu dan tidak boleh berpecah belah dalam beragama sebagaimana firman allah subhanahu wa taala
7065044 dia telah mensyariatkan bagi kalian tentang agama apa yang telah diwasiatkan nya kepada nuh dan apa yang telah kami wasiatkan kepadamu ibrahim musa dan isa yaitu tegakkanlah agama dan janganlah kalian berpecah belah tentangnya
7065045 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
7065046 dan janganlah kalian seperti orang orang yang berpecah belah dan berselisih setelah keterangan datang kepada mereka dan bagi mereka adzab yang pedih
7065047 dan tidak mengapa bagi penduduk negeri manapun jika tidak melihat hilal bulan tsabit di tempat tinggalnya pada malam ke 30 untuk mengambil hasil ru yatul hilal dari tempat lain di negerinya jika umat islam di negeri tersebut berbeda pendapat dalam hal penentuannya maka yang harus diikuti adalah keputusan penguasa di negeri tersebut bila ia seorang muslim karena dengan mengikuti keputusannya akan sirnalah perbedaan pendapat itu dan jika si penguasa bukan seorang muslim maka hendaknya mengikuti keputusan majelis departemen pusat yang membidangi urusan umat islam di negeri tersebut hal ini semata mata untuk menjaga kebersamaan umat islam dalam menjalankan shaum ramadhan dan shalat id di negeri mereka wabillahit taufiq washallallahu ala nabiyyina muhammad wa alihi wa shahbihi wasallam
7065048 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai
7065049 allah subhanahu wa taala mewajibkan kepada kita agar berpegang teguh dengan kitab nya al qur an dan sunnah nabi nya serta merujuk kepada keduanya di saat terjadi perselisihan
7065050 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya dan ulil amri di antara kalian
7065051 yang dimaksud dengan ulil amri adalah orang orang yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan untuk ditaati dari kalangan para penguasa dan pemimpin umat
7065052 wahai rasulullah kami tidak bertanya kepadamu tentang ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang bertakwa yang kami tanyakan adalah ketaatan terhadap penguasa yang berbuat demikian dan demikian ia sebutkan kejelekan kejelekannya
7065053 akan ada sepeninggalku nanti para imam penguasa yang mereka itu tidak berpegang dengan petunjukku dan tidak mengikuti cara jalanku dan akan ada di antara para penguasa tersebut orang orang yang berhati setan namun berbadan manusia
7065054 hendaknya engkau mendengar dan menaati penguasa tersebut walaupun punggungmu dicambuk dan hartamu dirampas olehnya maka dengarkanlah perintahnya dan taatilah dia
7065055 seburuk buruk penguasa kalian adalah yang kalian benci dan mereka pun membenci kalian kalian mencaci mereka dan mereka pun mencaci kalian
7065056 jangan selama mereka masih mendirikan shalat di tengah tengah kalian dan jika kalian melihat mereka mengerjakan perbuatan yang tidak kalian sukai maka bencilah perbuatannya dan jangan mencabut meninggalkan ketaatan darinya
7065057 urusan kaum muslimin tidaklah stabil tanpa adanya penguasa yang baik atau yang jahat sekalipun
7065058 wahai amirul mukminin kalau penguasa yang baik kami bisa menerimanya lalu bagaimana dengan yang jahat
7065059 sesungguhnya walaupun penguasa itu jahat namun allah subhanahu wa taala tetap memerankannya sebagai pengawas keamanan di jalan jalan dan pemimpin dalam jihad
7065060 adapun kewajiban menaati mereka penguasa tetaplah berlaku walaupun mereka berbuat jahat karena tidak menaati mereka dalam hal yang maruf akan mengakibatkan kerusakan yang jauh lebih besar dari apa yang ada selama ini dan di dalam kesabaran terhadap kejahatan mereka itu terdapat ampunan dari dosa dosa serta mendatangkan pahala yang berlipat
7065061 ketahuilah bahwa kejahatan penguasa tidaklah menghapuskan kewajiban menaati mereka pen yang allah subhanahu wa taala wajibkan melalui lisan nabi nya kejahatannya akan kembali kepada dirinya sendiri sedangkan kebaikan kebaikan yang engkau kerjakan bersamanya akan mendapat pahala yang sempurna insya allah yakni kerjakanlah shalat berjamaah shalat jumat dan jihad bersama mereka dan juga berpartisipasilah bersamanya dalam semua jenis ketaatan yang dipimpinnya
7065062 telah sepakat para ulama ahli fiqh ilmu dan ahli ibadah dan juga dari kalangan ubbad ahli ibadah dan zuhhad orang orang zuhud sejak generasi pertama umat ini hingga masa kita ini bahwa shalat jumat idul fitri dan idul adha hari hari mina dan arafah jihad haji serta penyembelihan qurban dilakukan bersama penguasa yang baik ataupun yang jahat
7065063 aku telah bertemu dengan 1 000 orang lebih dari ulama hijaz makkah dan madinah kufah bashrah wasith baghdad syam dan mesir
7065064 aku tidak melihat adanya perbedaan di antara mereka tentang perkara berikut ini beliau lalu menyebutkan sekian perkara di antaranya kewajiban menaati penguasa dalam hal yang maruf
7065065 di dalam hadits ini riwayat al bukhari dan muslim dari shahabat abu hurairah di atas pen terdapat keterangan tentang kewajiban menaati para penguasa dalam perkara perkara yang bukan kemaksiatan adapun hikmahnya adalah untuk menjaga persatuan dan kebersamaan umat islam karena di dalam perpecahan terdapat kerusakan
7065066 shaum itu di hari kalian umat islam bershaum waktu berbuka adalah pada saat kalian berbuka dan waktu berkurban iedul adha di hari kalian berkurban

7065086 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
7065087 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not quote unquote attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role

7065116 elk jaar vraagt de navo aan zijn lidstaten wat ze kunnen inbrengen in afghanistan
7065117 maar een specifieke vraag aan belgi naar meer manschappen kwam er niet
7065118 en indien die vraag in de toekomst zou worden gesteld zullen wij dat weigeren
7065119 opvallend is dat steeds meer jonge kinderen uit eenoudergezinnen komen
7065120 poti ligt niet in de bufferzone maar dat betekent niet dat we vanachter het hek gaan zitten toekijken hoe zij in hummers rondrijden
7065121 tia hellebaut heeft opnieuw haar klasse bewezen ze bevestigt dat ze tot de wereldtop behoort in het hoogspringen
7065122 haar medaille is niet alleen een persoonlijke overwinning voor tia maar ook een opsteker voor de hele belgische sportwereld een historische overwinning overigens want het was van 1964 geleden dat een belg goud won in een atletieknummer op de olympische spelen
7065123 de twee belgische medailles maken van deze olympische spelen definitief een succes voor ons land dat voorlopig elfde eindigt in de medaillestand
7065124 het doel was de finale halen dan nog vijfde worden is beter dan verhoopt en oververdiend
7065125 we dont actually target shows on other networks specifically were more about whats going to make a night of entertainment on seven
7065126 my dad whos here at auditions is my biggest support and inspiration and he got me into singing
7065127 so im doing it for us and my mum too
7065128 i really love drawing on experiences and looking in to the song and putting my heart in to it and trying to convey the message
7065129 my father committed suicide when i was little my mum met my now stepdad and hes my inspiration he adopted me so hes my father he got me into singing
7065130 i was in america and someone asked me how long i had been there and i had to think really hard and came up with maybe three or four days i had been there a month the tour manager turned around and said what are you talking about i thought i need to go home man im cracking up
7065131 its what everyone has to do america doesnt care about what you have done anywhere else if you are big in england its like so what you are big on a tiny little island dont come over here being all big son
7065132 its impossible to tell how things are going over there its so big
7065133 its like breaking 20 countries at once i never really get to hear how its going you put your head down and do a ridiculous promo schedule and then leave
7065134 i think if you stayed you would probably find out what was happening people tell me its going well though
7065135 when it comes to self promotion in england you have to calm it down more than anywhere else england is very strange on that front and it has a peculiar anti guitar kind of thing
7065136 it doesnt make sense if you can really play you are just being clever and you shouldnt be doing it if you cant then you are just bashing around and thats brilliant because anyone can do that and you are not making anyone feel bad
7065137 i just like stuff that is honest and if they can play then i think its slightly better than if you cant
7065138 there was so much adrenalin for me that it almost did itself it was almost like watching myself do it
7065139 you come up with a lot of ideas but there is not a lot of time for the disciplined bit where you have to actually sit down and fully make it into a finished piece of work
7065140 there is a whole side of my voice which isnt on the debut album at all
7065141 my vocal sound on the album is quite clean and then obviously live it is a bit more troll like
7065142 its funny you put things in context and suddenly they become something that would make someone blush
7065143 everyone even those who i know are knighted say the odd dirty word were in australia now and its just part of the landscape people have foul mouths over here youre a country of bogans like america
7065144 im not really that passionate about dirty words in songs i dont care if theyre in there or not i just tend to put into a song what seems like is happening in front of me
7065145 when i was nine years old id written a song that was supposed to be some sort of metaphor and i got really upset because people didnt get it
7065146 it was about getting ill on a merry go round there was this kid in the song who was too scared to take his circumstances and the merry go round was meant to represent the cycle of life everyone took it literally and i was like are you people idiots this is my art
7065147 this album may be framed by my publicist as being directly related to events in my life but i think when all the dust settles and if people bother to listen to the record in maybe 10 years then i dont think theyll hear it that way
7065148 the album is not about divorce and its not even about the process because if it was it would be brutal
7065149 but i only say that as a songwriter to defend my songwriting because if that album was about divorce then im a really sh y songwriter
7065150 it doesnt annoy me that its being slated as a divorce album you can only fight so many fights it comes down to do i want to revise my bio with a publicist who insists on it being one way when i could look after my kids and write a song and get some sleep
7065151 gun show loophole i e ban private sales and supports renewal of the 94 assault weapons ban
7065152 stop senseless gun violence renewing the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole the biden crime bill provides for a straight forward reauthorization of the assault weapons ban that became law in 1994 and it closes the so called gun show loophole by requiring all gun show sales submit to federal background checks just like any store based firearm sale
7065153 damn this awb i wanted to kill that bitch with an ak47 but now i guess ive gotta use my hi point
7065154 a cheeky little monkey came up to me and said im sorry russells having his lunch right now hell be ready in about 20 minutes
7065155 i sat down thinking i beg your pardon im bloody kate ceberano and ive come to work with him
7065156 theyre like coiffed poodles man their legs are shaved their muscles are silky and buffed and greased and oiled
7065157 a footballer is part of a group of 40 blokes a team dynamic makes it a lot easier
7065158 and things are absolutely laid on for us youve got to be here youve got to be there you rock up and they do absolutely everything for you
7065159 but as a musician youve got to look after everything in the early stages you fight tooth and nail
7065160 for him the learning curve is going to be tricky because hes been given so many privileges
7065161 clean them just the back and legs mate get me a towel here take my dirty clothes get me a drink
7065162 i drag him through the service entry out the back trawling a 2000 dress through leftover food particles it isnt glamorous
7065163 the pay for a musician is striking a chord and knowing you made that chord out of nothing
7065164 the way ive played football throughout my whole career is in a fun energetic way
7065165 i like to take big marks kick goals and i like to celebrate because thats what kids love to do
7065166 that fills me with great pleasure because thats what ive wanted to do from the start
7065167 and its the same with music i am singing some really cool songs that people love to hear when theyre in a pub having a beer or at a bbq having a sausage
7065168 ill think of that when im having a sausage i will i will
7065169 when he writes from his voice and from his heart he is such a romantic
7065170 he sings and writes really intimately from that place in his voice
7065171 i cant really pick up a guitar and play a rock song thats not my style
7065172 if he wasnt talented hed be out looks can only get you so far
7065173 its a good healthy respect for the older woman and younger man
7065174 i have a prejudice towards people who are untalented it happened to people i went out with too
7065175 id often be with individuals then discover they were untalented in a particular area and id just turn off
7065176 it took a certain type of person who had the whole goods to keep me interested
7065177 im ashamed to say this is a part of my character but its true
7065178 youd see them on the dancefloor and be oh im so not into that person anymore
7065179 thats true and shopping for shoes tells you an awful lot
7065180 i love a good wow factor and if someone has that in spades i forgive a thousand gazillion sins on other levels of life
7065181 that talent has me utterly in their keep for the rest of time
7065182 im sure kate had massive reservations driving to the football ground when we first met
7065183 and theyll keep it real he keeps it real ill keep it real if we do that i dont see how it could fail i know everybody wants to put the footy celebrity tag on him
7065184 but my deal is to keep the artist and his ambition in art going because he is a really good singer and musician
7065185 i must confess i would have never done it had sir donald been alive
7065186 but its a happy novelty song which has put a smile on the face of everyone who has heard it
7065187 i had written a song called what is australia to me for the occasion but i was not invited to perform
7065188 i then offered my services but was rejected it left me feeling rather depressed
7065189 it was after the event but i felt i should inform sir donald
7065190 within a week he replied and it was one of the kindest letters ive ever received
7065191 thank you for your courteous letter and the records accompanying it by a coincidence my grandchildren came to my home the day your letter arrived so i played the record to them and gave them one copy keeping the other for myself itll be a cherished possession as long as im spared and im honoured to get a mention in the verse
7065192 making lemonade out of the lemon which was the bicentennial concert rejection
7065193 then he replied and i replied and so on it went
7065194 then an invitation came for me to visit him at his adelaide home at no 2 holden st kensington ill never ever forget that the invitation and the visit it was melbourne cup day 1988 and the bradmans were wonderful hosts
7065195 mind you meeting sir donald for the first time was the closest experience to meeting god gradually i discovered he was a down to earth man who possessed a lot of very warm human qualities
7065196 he had a great sense of humour and he was generous very generous he of course loved lady jessie and he loved his children and he really adored his grandchildren
7065197 in his second or third letter he started mentioning music it was after i had sent him some records
7065198 my typing is like my piano playing too many wrong keys
7065199 he recorded a bunch of songs and piano pieces including one called every day is a rainbow day for me
7065200 music played a much bigger part in his life than most people ever believed or realised
7065201 it was day before sir donald turned 82 yet he and lady jessie took the time to attend that was very special for me
7065202 he was not there but i sang at his 90th birthday celebrations in adelaide and i farewelled him with the lords prayer at his memorial service in bowral in 2001
7065203 i wear rhinestones on my nails this is a new thing for me because i have to wear these nails in real life so i am always apologising for them
7065204 then i realise i am apologising to people who have these nails so i am insulting people every day
7065205 its been fascinating asking what does an american girl think makes her really pretty they think its pretty to have extensions even if people know theyre extensions
7065206 it just looks so fake and ugly but its like a status symbol
7065207 i was so lucky that i didnt have to wear prosthetics i got to sleep
7065208 my call time for make up was six in the morning theirs was one and they had wrapped filming only an hour before
7065209 they would drive home take their watch off go to the bathroom put their watch back on and go back to set i dont know how they did it
7065210 guillermo really had to take my hand i really wanted to shrink back to what liz was before and there were moments where he was like no shes confident shes stronger dont go there again
7065211 but its hard when you think you know a character you want to keep going to how you originally set it in your heart but liz is a different woman now
7065212 so that was strange for me ive never played such a straightforward kind of woman i always play someone whos a bit off or over the top but she wasnt she was just really dry
7065213 when im trying to do just a regular girl theres no point just get some cute girl next door i cant do that regular thing
7065214 when i try to be charming it just falls flat im not afraid of playing the fool i think theres a lot of humour that can come out of it
7065215 an agent came in and saw me and thought i was a lot younger than i was and then that was it i got to be a working actress
7065216 i went from struggling to get some little independent tiny films to just getting to do what i love to do and i dont know what id do if i didnt do this
7065217 ive been working ever since cruel intentions so im extremely grateful for that film
7065218 surprisingly even when the people i play are so over the top that you think oh that cant be real its always based on someone really real or else i would be too embarrassed to play it
7065219 even someone like vivian kensington from legally blonde was based on someone i grew up with i even wore exactly what this girl wore
7065220 so theres some reality in it for me so i cannot feel foolish on set even if i do things a little too big it gives me the permission to do it too big because i know its real so i can take it up a notch
7065221 the show is really really well written so the character is there but i based it on two people in my life who crack me up
7065222 one wants to be a trophy wife the other never will be they are really funny people
7065223 were middle class celebrity obsessed tabloid crazy and kind of superficial we think we are so fabulous and were not really at all
7065224 i think im a trophy wife as kim but my husband works at the best buy us electronics chain store im a bit delusional
7065225 my husband expects me to do things like microwave a dinner every once in a while but im a trophy wife and i dont do that so i move back in with mum and she cant wait to get rid of me but at the same time were really close
7065226 it is a sophisticated show for a show about some common people i think kath amp kim will do well i really hope people get it
7065227 its just another spin on the same old thing again
7065228 its just another spin on the same old thing again
7065229 it is important to approach films on such issues with sensitivity for the making of dark the team was briefed to bring out the strength of the people who are faced with disability and ensure that their strength was celebrated
7065230 the film evoked the concept of how even in the dark the visually impaired lead a normal life
7065231 in fact although its a constraint to get films like this screened as they are produced digitally and not on film 60 mm or 35 mm many of our films including dark which is in bengali has been aired on national tv in kolkata and on a national channel like sahara
7065232 the challenge is drawing attention mainstreaming id love to watch such films on television they are any day more informative and entertaining than the trash we get to see nowadays
7065233 despite recognition there is a lack of facilities and opportunities not because of lack of doing but lack of wanting to do something
7065234 disability should be enveloped in the mainstream commercial cinemas movies on disability like black and taare zameen par are few and scarce

7065299 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7065300 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7065301 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs

7065316 todays modern woman sees more relevance in tv icons who promote female empowerment such as buffy the vampire slayer than in church and traditional religion according to new research to be published in the church times this week
7065317 it says that instead young women are becoming attracted to the pagan religion wicca where females play a central role which has grown in popularity after being featured positively in films tv shows and books
7065318 over the past decade it claims women have been leaving churches at twice the rate of men in addition the census is said to show that teenage boys now outnumber girls in the pews for the first time dr aune says the church must adapt to the needs of modern women if it is to stop them leaving in their droves

7065328 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7065329 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7065330 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7065331 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7065334 the unveiling of the dr p phillips orlando performing arts centers design marks a defining moment in our history
7065335 the completion of schematic design is the first step toward establishing a multicultural hub for artistic excellence in central florida and a civic center that will foster urban transformation and community pride the building is also carefully designed to provide the best possible home for orlandos regional arts groups and arts education as well as a desirable destination for floridians and tourists
7065336 todays design unveil is a prelude to what this community has been asking for a world class performing arts center
7065337 this spectacular design will bring new energy new excitement and new investment into our downtown core
7065338 we chose to create a hybrid design that would balance the centers unique structure with a welcoming atmosphere
7065339 to produce a successful design it was also crucial for us to engage the brightest minds in their respective fields of expertise
7065340 this process has allowed us to ensure that the arts center will rise to the highest standards be as functional as possible and foster fiscal and environmental sustainability

7065556 on the grounds that one would not like to be in the condemned mans place to be in the place of the condemned man is at the same time to be the murderer if the condemned man can earn our sympathy it is precisely by being able to recognize his crime and by desiring to pay for it with his life thereby removing all antagonism between him and us
7065557 he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
7065558 having been justified by faith we have peace with god
7065559 having been justified we have obtained our introduction by faith romans 5 1 2 christians have an entirely new standing and that standing is
7065560 for the law since it has only a shadow for the good things to come and not the very form of things can never by the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make perfect those who draw near otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshipers having once been cleansed would no longer have had consciousness of sins but in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins

7065575 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7065576 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7065626 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

7065632 at this moment i can say that our talks with the governor appointed panel have been absolutely fruitful and productive
7065633 this also depends on our and their viewpoints we are hopeful of the talks progressing towards that end
7065634 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7065635 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7065636 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7065637 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7065638 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7065639 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7065640 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7065641 you want people to think well of you dont you
7065642 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7065643 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7065644 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7065645 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7065646 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7065647 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7065648 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7065649 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7065650 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7065651 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7065652 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7065653 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7065654 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7065655 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe
7065656 this will really help us under the cap if we say
7065657 we really hope he doesnt sign anywhere else because that would hurt us

7065673 morne and albie are certainly in our first choice starting line up so to have both of them out was a big disappointment
7065674 we wanted to come out and play with our first choice side and what it does is that it also disrupts our balance hugely at number seven and number eight we didnt have a guy who can hit the ball out of the ground
7065675 when youre needing a big over albie is the guy who can hit it out of the ground for you we had johan botha and vernon philander who can work it around quite nicely but they needed to be batting with someone who was in and who could hit boundaries at will so that was a pity
7065676 to be honest im a little bit worried about him
7065677 were hoping to give him an injection and the physio is working with him all the time we thought he could have played in the twenty20 at durham last week and yesterday he bowled 12 balls and he felt it slightly
7065678 i could see that when he bowled even though it was indoors off a short run up that he was labouring and wasnt confident to pull through with his action because of that strain there was not point playing him and we hope another four days will make him 100 per cent right
7065679 we need to work on our death bowling because we went for 95 in the last 10 overs
7065680 i dont want to make any excuses but we havent been able to practise outdoors and the bowlers were unable to do it indoors
7065681 we saw all of the top order get in but nobody took it through so that was disappointing and being rusty or having a lack of preparation doesnt affect that when your batters get in they should take it through
7065682 every loss hurts a lot and the worrying thing is we didnt play very well and i thought england played very well

7065685 this opportunity to participate in the maiden edition of the games came as a result of our outstanding performances at previous chess olympiads
7065686 as has been amply demonstrated in empirical studies the nature of market outcomes are massively influenced by public policies in education and literacy epidemiology land reform microcredit facilities appropriate legal protection etc and in each of these fields there are things to be done through public action that can radically alter the outcome of local and global economic relations it is this class of interdependences that have to be understood and utilized to alter the inequalities and asymmetries that characterize the world economy
7065687 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole
7065688 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
7065689 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
7065690 how i think about the shroud comes from the shroud its not gee im a christian so ill force it to be what i want it to be thats not scientific logic
7065691 its like were on an archaeological expedition thats not finished im not sure well ever be truly finished
7065692 a lot of the pleasure is in the journey itself
7065693 recognising the unusual circumstances of the case the tribunal find that the procedure used by the respondent to dismiss the claimant was not in accordance with the industrial relations acts the claimant tendered her resignation in may 2005 but the employer instead of dealing with it at that time believed that he was entitled to retain it and act upon it at a later date of his choosing this he purported to do in september 2005 at a meeting on 16th september 2005 he told the claimant that he was accepting her resignation some days later he changed this to suspension without pay a short time after this he changed the suspension without pay to with pay in january 2006 he stopped paying the claimant in june 2006 he dismissed her this in the opinion of the tribunal was an unfair procedure
7065694 the claimant seeks redress for the alleged breaches of the terms of employment information act

7065704 we went to pakistan for the asia cup and came back not that long ago
7065705 from our point of view everything was quite okay for us when it comes to security matters
7065706 right now sri lankan cricket slc have not told us anything other than that
7065707 we are quite happy that once we finish this odi series with india we will start our preparation towards the champions trophy whether it be pakistan or wherever it is
7065708 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving

7065710 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7065711 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7065712 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7065713 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7065714 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7065715 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7065716 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry

7065733 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7065734 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7065735 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7065736 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7065737 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7065738 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7065739 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7065740 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me

7065747 it is a significant step up over the previous generation and surpasses its predecessor in appeal he said
7065748 one of the problems for us all is that we are not and cannot often be aware of whats going on that the camera hasnt focused on
7065749 when i was told today about the main fundamental ground on which these courses in which youre all taking part are based media and global change i immediately remembered the latin slogan that flew on the flag above shakespeares globe theater totus mundus agit histrionem all the world moves the actor is actually what i think is the direct translation as opposed to all the worlds a stage all the world moves the actor by which can be considered not only the professional actor but the individual the individuals who find themselves in the world
7065750 we certainly have the capacity to be independent thinkers and of course we can be more independent as thinkers and as human beings if we are capable of examining our most fervently held beliefs and seeing them in this changing world

7065752 the person who took care of all the business was my mother
7065753 my father had no idea about the family business what oil leases he owned in oklahoma

7065756 before we get to the second of three in wrigley
7065757 he had 75 pitches after four and we had a long fourth johnson explained
7065758 was unfazed by the phenom buzz and 97 mph heat that distinguished strasburg he had struck out 11 and allowed only one hit in seven scoreless innings for an aug 14 victory against the netherlands and he was held back for his second olympic start in this big test but cuba was just too hard to contain
7065759 im really starting to get conflicted knowing that my desire to see dc draft a pitcher as talented as strasburg must by necessity be linked to the nationals continuing to lose games at the same rate theyve established so far in 08
7065760 so in 500 600 at bats does he walk much
7065761 so where would 20 hrs 40 doubles and 80 rbis place him amongst sss
7065762 thats utley and uggla territory right up there at the top so why not just start belliard and guzman up the middle next season as long as they dont get injured
7065763 re how do you get husband to learn a lesson use a chainz one connect to his wallet and the other end with his pants he wont lose
7065764 character is doing the right thing even when no one is looking

7065766 not everyone wants a dog due to lack of time and many other reasons
7065767 i think the misconception comes from the way they eat theyre only messy when they eat and that is because they get so excited
7065768 hes part of our family instead of having a baby we got a pig theyre just like another child theyve got the same habits
7065769 i really wanted one from about eight years ago and then i saw him at the pet store and thought i want him
7065770 we feed merlin the same time as the kids otherwise he cries
7065771 he eats a lot of fruit and vegetables coleslaw peeled and boiled potatoes carrots pasta weetbix bananas he loves bananas its his fetish
7065772 we play chasey with him we try to teach him how to play soccer
7065773 they can play with you and they wont scratch you
7065774 he comes and snuggles up in your bed hes very nice

7065776 pigs have a mind of their own provided you respect their space theyll respect yours

7065778 robinho me lo tiene que decir en persona y no lo ha hecho
7065779 we hadden ook eigenlijk een mannetje of twee te kort om het af te kunnen maken
7065780 no me ha pedido no jugar me lo tiene que decir en persona no a trav s de nadie a mi no me lo ha dicho y como est en condiciones para jugar mi obligaci n es ponerle no tengo ninguna duda
7065781 recib sus declaraciones sin sorpresa simplemente las esperaba mucho antes no hay que dramatizar mucho m s es una parte del juego estoy convencido de que robinho se va a quedar lo que ha ocurrido lo esperaba antes no tan tarde pero lo que pasa es que se acaban los d as y hay prisa

7065783 es lo que m s me interesa poder ganar el trofeo y no una discusi n sobre robinho
7065784 est en la convocatoria porque est en perfectas condiciones para jugar hay que estar en todas unas veces en situaciones m s c modas y otras no tanto realmente conozco a robinho y no es el que me preocupa

7065791 i only saw them four times a year and they were a loving couple
7065792 violence is an issue for all schools government catholic and independent the community as a whole and parents right across australia
7065793 many teachers are at the coalface of a number of community related issues where parents and carers are reacting to issues such as financial hardship mental health issues and drug related issues
7065794 sa schools do not tolerate bad behaviour and use suspension and exclusion measures where required
7065795 teachers are having to deal with a number of social issues and behavioural disorders without the support they need
7065796 when you have children who are prone to violence or have adhd or aspergers you have to have the support there at schools to manage that
7065797 ive had scissors thrown at my head by a student
7065798 were told to always remain where people can see us
7065799 we want to investigate these things to not only deal with the incident but to prevent reoccurrences
7065800 we also look at crime prevention through environmental design things like lighting more open space and not having long narrow corridors between buildings
7065801 its hard to believe but in parts of london paris amsterdam and malmo civil authorities have largely lost control to the rule of sharia imposed by islamic supremacists who want to see sharia law become the law of the land
7065802 under sharia laws women and minorities are deprived of their human rights that we in the west take for granted when the constitution of any country deprives some of its citizens of their human rights the impact will be general and eventually effect all thats why if you take a look at most if not all of sharia countries you will see suppression and miseries prevail therefore if opportunity opens the majority of the men and women in sharia countries would emigrate to the west
7065803 im just working hard to do my part to help find a turning point for the korean film industry because i know our filmmakers are having a hard time
7065804 when the movie became an unexpected hit and kims character drew attention his status as a comic actor got a boost
7065805 as an eccentric creature of the night this role was equally challenging because plenty of exaggerated facial expressions and slapstick were required kim loved the character due to the positive reaction from audiences a sequel to the comic vampire film is also set for release later this year
7065806 i wanted to play a teacher in the movie but i had a clear picture about the role i would play
7065807 i got several offers for a teacher role but declined to join the projects because i did not see the picture i had in mind but the role in english teacher was different and more importantly the character was exactly what i thought about a teacher role
7065808 instead of meaningless laughter i want to create laughs that come with a touch of humanity or warmth
7065809 i respect my teachers and i believe their teaching affected my life in a big way and perhaps thats why i finally got into a college even after i had failed to pass the entrance exam four times
7065810 my impression is that not only english education but also the relationships between teachers and students seem to stress rules rather than conversations
7065811 in this movie cheon tries to close the gap with students through practical conversation rather than grammar rules

7065965 contiene uno spezzone di unintervista di john lennon rilasciata alla bbc pochi giorni prima della sua morte
7065966 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7065967 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7065968 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7065969 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7065970 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7065971 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7065972 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7065973 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7065974 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7065975 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7065976 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7065977 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7065978 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis
7065979 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7065980 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7065981 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7065982 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7065983 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7065984 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7065985 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7065986 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7065987 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7065988 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7065989 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7065990 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralising it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs

7065996 his project was the reason behind the unity of many political blocs that once differed in viewpoints
7065997 all the talk today is about my opponents selection of his running mate
7065998 to his new running mate my congratulations and ill get back to you real soon on your debating opponent
7065999 one of the richest members of the senate yet barely a sliver of it is in his name
7066000 detect a whiff of mockery in the obamas 3 a m running mate announcement
7066001 are going to go all the way out there and not be able to get in
7066002 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me and that notion of that basic principle applies to poverty
7066003 it should be a good gathering of people all working toward an excellent thing and thats to move relocate and rescue the fish
7066004 there really is the potential for saving thousands of fish
7066005 i had to call and call and call just like anybody else
7066006 i had to call several times before i got anybody
7066007 we had a resource that we could help somebody with i made a judgment that it was the right thing to do
7066008 i am prepared to pay for any citizens i receive just like any other citizen
7066009 no dont tell me i dont want to know anything
7066010 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7066011 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7066012 even my parents found it hard to accept it at first because they felt it was a waste of time and money but if youre not a fan of anime or manga i think you wont understand why we do what we do
7066013 id been called crazy and a freak when doing cosplay in the past in fact ive gotten used to people cursing and hurling insults at me when im in costume
7066014 what people dont realise is that its something we really love and enjoy doing its just like those other people who go for idol competitions they do it because singing is a passion for them and this is our passion
7066015 when we attend events like these its usually to meet like minded people because not many people understand us these events are the only place where we really get to share our passion with everyone else
7066016 were basically doing handicraft when we make these costumes right i thought all parents like that
7066017 we have a very healthy culture here we dont smoke drink do drugs or anything like that so whats bad about it
7066018 i had to do research source for the right materials find out the best way to manufacture it when we go to the tailor we know exactly what needs to be done
7066019 its a long and challenging process but its also one that i enjoy a lot its like an art in the sense that once you see the final result of your work you get a great sense of satisfaction
7066020 vandaag waren er drie mannen tegelijk een aan de voorkant een aan de achterkant en een boven ik kon geen kant op
7066021 desilusionado no me voy tampoco satisfecho porque no me conformo con un octavo lugar ol mpico s que pude haber hecho m s
7066022 con ganas de trabajar fuerte en el pr ximo ciclo y recargar esas ganas y ese nimo que siempre me ha caracterizado
7066023 pod a haber estado m s arriba me voy con ganas de seguir trabajando para poder mejorar y bueno es una competencia como otra pues aqu no se acab al contrario empieza un nuevo ciclo y a trabajar
7066024 de hecho hac a dos giros y medio pero en esta competencia no los met porque hab a unas peque as fallas pero s hay que trabajar una nueva lista de clavados y la hora de competir hacerlo como en el entrenamiento
7066025 el nivel estaba fort simo y me falt ponerme ah a ese nivel me deja claro que tengo el nivel mas tengo que hacerlo a la hora de la competencia y estar concentrado y no fallar
7066026 tratar de hacerlo bien tratar de demostrar que he trabajado hacer lo que s hacer y a veces sale y a veces no
7066027 a lo mejor no llegu de lo m s favorable
7066028 esto le prueba a los que dudaron del grupo que este es un grupo ganador vinimos buscando el oro y eso fue lo que conseguimos
7066029 este es un d a muy especial no tengo palabras a n no entiendo la dimensi n de todo esto que est pasando pero sin duda s que este es el d a m s feliz de mi vida
7066030 aplaude y lagrimea la escena ideal todo celeste y blanco todo bien argentino todos de oro emocionan contagian y es l gico
7066031 son los due os ol mpicos de la pelota son los futbolistas de hoy en otra consagraci n hist rica unidos con dos conos del mundial 86
7066032 un gen alimentado por la m stica de aquellos h roes de m xico so ando unos y otros con repetir en 2010 en el mundial de sud frica lo que no se consigue desde hace 22 a os
7066033 y el destino quiso que tuviera que darse de madrugada como para que no quedara duda alguna de que se trat de una jornada nica e inolvidable
7066034 la verdad que tuvo que ver un poco de nerviosismo y me falt un poco m s de constancia a la hora de ingresar
7066035 esa etapa tiene que ser perfecta en esta clase de competencias no hay espacios para clavados a media tienen que ser todos perfectos
7066036 estoy contento de haber estado entre los mejores aunque al final no salieron bien las cosas
7066037 mis marcas no fueron tan malas pero pudieron ser m s altas
7066038 tengo capacidad y soy serio la gente no me afect hice lo que pude pero a veces las cosas salen y a veces no
7066039 as son los juegos uno no sabe nunca que puede pasar y ahorita gan el australiano lo que toca ahora es seguir trabando para los siguientes juegos de londres
7066040 me voy conforme y con las ganas de seguir trabajando y siempre mejor
7066041 a esta rival nina solheim la ten amos muy estudiada
7066042 tiene muy buen o do ella me escucha y en todo me obedeci en los cuatro combates tanto con ella como con memo p rez estuve atento
7066043 los kazakos compraron a los jueces a m me ofrecieron dinero
7066044 el taekwondo trae la esperanza del esp ritu ol mpico a los j venes atletas de los pa ses pobres y peque os
7066045 he ido al l mite todo el tiempo pero no ha podido ser
7066046 a veces te van bien las cosas y otras no nos hemos quedado fuera por tan s lo algunas mil simas he ido durante todo el tiempo al l mite pero no ha podido ser
7066047 no hab a m s que sacar hemos ido demasiado justos el objetivo siempre es intentar pasar a la q3 y esta vez no ha podido ser los dem s iban m s r pido que nosotros
7066048 salir desde esta posici n tan retrasada tiene una ventaja y es que podemos elegir la estrategia que queramos podemos arriesgar
7066049 igual de esta forma nos va mejor ya que si sale un coche de seguridad o si ocurre cualquier otra cosa nos puede dar una ventaja a ver si podemos sacar provecho de esta elecci n
7066050 todos mis combates han sido finales de juegos ol mpicos
7066051 momentos especiales como el ganar un combate y la final ol mpica
7066052 es un buen resultado pata el taekwondo de m xico por el trabajo en equipo que se ha realizado
7066053 cuando regres a las pistas en 2006 no sab a si iba a poder saltar los 6 metros
7066054 lo que me hizo regresar fue la voluntad de sentir esa alegr a nica de hacer lo que me gusta hice deporte toda mi vida y es lo nico que se hacer mejor la gente se olvida de las dificultades cuando gana una medalla s lo tiene alegr a este momento es el mejor de mi vida
7066055 nadie olvida el pasado pero aprende de l nada m s justo que una medalla de oro para compensar todo lo que pase pasar la p gina de forma correcta es muy gratificante ni yo me lo creo
7066056 estamos destrozados pero hace cuatro a os est bamos peor
7066057 es una final que quer amos y que hemos salido a buscar pero nos hemos encontrado con el rea repleta de alemanes cuando alemania se pone por delante es muy complicado marcarle gol estamos destrozados pero en una final hay un ganador y un perdedor hace cuatro a os est bamos peor
7066058 no se puede hacer m s lo han dado todo
7066059 es un grupo tremendo de jugadores y personas que lo ha dado todo y no se puede hacer m s
7066060 no hemos ganado y no se puede hacer m s ya lo dije despu s de la semifinal este es un grupo tremendo de jugadores y de personas lo han dado todo un equipo que ha jugado tan ofensivo como espa a ha tenido dos partidos con resultados de f tbol y eso no es normal en hockey
7066061 es una l stima porque a espa a le gusta atacar
7066062 ellos saben defender son los mejores del mundo haci ndolo en un campo que hubiera estado r pido habr a sido m s f cil no es una excusa hemos puesto raza hemos dado todo lo que se puede hemos jugado en la final yendo a saco no se puede pedir m s
7066063 espero resarcirme de la mala suerte que tuve en hungr a
7066064 sigo teniendo un coche estupendo lo hemos visto en muchas carreras este a o e incluyo la ltima de hungr a pero esta vez espero tener mejor suerte lo m s importante es que hemos trabajado a fondo con el coche y los simuladores y hemos dado con una configuraci n ptima
7066065 espero volver pronto a lo m s alto del podio y para eso es fundamental salir desde la primera plaza
7066066 es muy complicado hacer la vuelta perfecta porque la pista se encuentra cada d a en unas condiciones muy diferentes
7066067 hoy he cometido algunos errores en el segundo sector pero he mejorado en el tercero y eso me ha permitido seguir arriba en la tabla de tiempos espero que la pista tenga m s adherencia ma ana para que todos nos podamos divertir
7066068 soy campe n ol mpico y se lo dedico a la rep blica dominicana
7066069 tengo que darle las gracias a mi entrenador pedro luis d az que ha sido el mago el que me ha permitido conseguir el gran triunfo
7066070 la estrategia que definimos ambos despu s de ver el v deo de mi rival fue perfecta
7066071 es algo maravilloso saber que puedo ofrecer a mi pa s este gran triunfo y m s despu s de saber que han estado pendiente de todo lo que he hecho en este torneo
7066072 ahora es el momento de recoger los frutos del esfuerzo y sacrificio realizado desde que comenc a boxear en 1994
7066073 nunca tuvimos duda de que me llevar a una medalla de aqu y para eso me prepar pero la verdad que el oro es lo m ximo y lo consegu porque hice la estrategia perfecta
7066074 no hubo m s secreto que cerrarle todas las salidas tirarle golpes y no quitarle presi n
7066075 llevo ya m s de 325 peleas desde que comenc a boxear en 1994 y mi preparaci n ha sido la mejor de siempre
7066076 quiero muy pronto cuando regrese a rep blica dominicana compartir el gran triunfo con mi hija jennifer de 4 a os y adonis mi hijo de dos
7066077 es el triunfo de todos los dominicanos y tambi n para el boxeo de latinoam rica que en este torneo nunca nos trataron bien en cuanto a la manera como los jueces vieron las peleas
7066078 s que es el momento de la celebraci n pero tambi n quiero reivindicar el esfuerzo y sacrificio que hicieron el resto de los peleadores dominicanos y latinos
7066079 pienso en l como jugador del benfica y s que a l le gusta el trabajo que realiza aqu
7066080 es un jugador importante pero existen otras opciones todas ellas preparadas para batallar por el benfica
7066081 tenemos la ilusi n de realizar una buena temporada y por eso queremos comenzar de la mejor forma el campeonato con ganas de ganar desde el primer partido
7066082 muy contento porque argentina ya tiene todo lo que vino a buscar
7066083 ya hab a ganado el campeonato del mundo sub20 pero esto es el doble mejor a n el triple mucho m s
7066084 no hab a so ado con meter el gol que decidiese la final
7066085 para el futuro china debe volverse m s internacional y la olimp ada fue un paso importante
7066086 era crucial que la comunidad internacional nos diera el reconocimiento debido
7066087 las olimp adas son un prisma para los conflictos emociones y tendencias en curso y que se expresan en p blico
7066088 esperaban demostrarle al mundo una china que despu s de 30 a os de r pido desarrollo no se hab a visto en cientos de a os
7066089 aplaudir a equipos extranjeros hubiera sido inconcebible hace cuatro a os ni qu hablar hace 20 a os
7066090 ma ana ser decisivo rodar por la zona limpia del circuito
7066091 los mec nicos han hecho un gran trabajo pero felipe massa ha sido mejor espero mejorar ma ana porque nos hemos esforzado mucho en la preparaci n de este circuito
7066092 creo que ser decisivo mantener la posici n en la zona limpia del circuito desde la misma salida
7066093 ha sido una clasificaci n estupenda he de felicitar a todo mi equipo porque el coche ha estado fant stico y cada vez estamos m s cerca de ferrari y mclaren
7066094 las ruedas se comportan bien aunque no hay demasiada adherencia as que vamos a intentar no cometer los mismos errores que en hungria no es un secreto que fallamos estrepitosamente con la presi n de los neum ticos
7066095 hay varios sitios en los que se puede adelantar pero va a ser muy complicado porque pr cticamente todos estamos rodando en los mismos tiempos y es peligroso rodar fuera del carril limpio
7066096 partir del primer lugar aqu por primera vez es muy agradable
7066097 la pista no es muy f cil especialmente por la superficie algo resbalosa y por eso es dif cil hacer una vuelta perfecta
7066098 va a ser dif cil de ganarle a massa ma ana pero por cierto lo intentaremos
7066099 esta es la revancha de los latinos esta medalla es para rep blica dominicana para mi pa s para mi familia
7066100 soy campe n ol mpico y todav a no me lo puedo creer
7066101 en las semifinales venci al cubano rosniel iglesias yo sub al cuadril tero por la revancha de los latinos
7066102 esta vez el lema no fue otro que tener siempre la iniciativa atacar y no darle opci n al rival para que impusiese su ritmo
7066103 todo sali a la perfecci n y ahora estoy muy feliz por el triunfo conseguido
7066104 hay muchos deportistas por ah poniendo el nombre de colombia en alto
7066105 hay muchos deportistas ah poniendo el nombre de colombia en alto

7066107 estoy feliz por el resultado que tuve de mejorar lo de hace cuatro a os de atenas y ya pues a disfrutar y descansar y que colombia disfrute conmigo
7066108 muchas metas que ten a atrasadas he superado resultados anteriores he superado mis marcas por ahora pues y sin querer ser cre do el nico colombiano que ha estado en tres finales ol mpicas en unos mismos jjoo que no es nada f cil
7066109 disfrutar dormir mucho descansar llegar a colombia y estar con mi familia
7066110 tengo muy buena amistad con matthew es un excelente saltador y ha logrado algo incre ble que es arrebatarle la medalla de oro a china aqu en su casa en pek n
7066111 en mis primeros ol mpicos haber tenido la medalla de oro es muy importante trabaj muy fuerte para tenerla no s lo en lo personal sino como equipo este es un equipo muy grande gracias a mis compa eros que me ayudaron much simo
7066112 me siento contenta de haber obtenido resultados es algo que me he propuesto y esto apenas inicia para m carrera deportiva
7066113 estoy chica de edad y estar feliz cosechando triunfos para m xico
7066114 me siento contenta con las dos medallas que se obtuvieron en taekwondo la primera fue una gran motivaci n de saber que se pod a lograr
7066115 trat de disfrutar cada combate y me propuse a pensar que cada uno era una final donde ten a que dar todo mi coraz n sacar la lucha la garra sabiendo todo el esfuerzo que hab a puesto que esto era para lo que hab a entrenado para esto para ser campeona ol mpica

7066130 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7066131 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7066132 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space
7066133 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper
7066134 it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7066135 thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7066136 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
7066137 he would terminate his contract and the courts would decide what he has to pay we want robinho to stay at madrid but this situation leaves us unable to do anything
7066138 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7066139 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run
7066140 no because transfers take place when competitions are over not five days before the season starts it is a lack of respect for the club its history and the supporters
7066141 he has been picked because he is in perfect condition to play

7066195 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people

7066197 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7066198 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf

7066215 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7066336 elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research and human cloning
7066337 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life
7066338 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
7066339 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity

7066347 we are worried with heat stroke and other problems players may suffer in this kind of weather

7066428 we gaven geen criteria mee we wilden kijken wat er zou gebeuren als dorpelingen zelf baas over hun dorp zouden worden power to the people het enige wat ik gezegd heb geen grote bedrijventerreinen erbij of een vinexwijk met vijfduizend woningen maar dat wilden ze zelf niet eens
7066429 wij regelen alles dicht de daken moeten zo hoog de dakgoot moet zo schuin zo proberen wij de karakteristieken van onze dorpen te bewaken je wordt er doodmoe van je moet al die regels gaan lopen controleren en er is altijd wel een slimmerik die ze probeert te ontduiken het is niet effectief geef mensen meer verantwoordelijkheid voor hun leefomgeving

7066447 a lo largo del fin de semana no ha habido ning n accidente fuerte y esperemos que siga todo igual pero varios pilotos han estado cerca de rozar el muro y si eso pasa en carrera implicar necesariamente la aparici n en pista del coche de seguridad
7066448 hoy no hemos sido suficientemente r pidos tenemos que mejorar empezando por la carrera de ma ana otras veces hemos logrado entrar en la q3 por d cimas pero en esta ocasi n nos ha tocado a nosotros quedarnos fuera no se ha podido hacer m s
7066449 la de ma ana ser una carrera en la que estamos en manos del coche de seguridad y de que aparezca cuando ya hayamos repostado de lo contrario s lo podremos finalizar en octava o novena posici n algo que no da demasiadas satisfacciones
7066450 hoy hice tres intentos al l mite el mejor y el peor estuvieron separados por dos d cimas as que es evidente que ah est mi limite no puedo esperar un milagro para ganar un segundo de repente es una pena porque estamos corriendo en casa
7066451 tenemos m s flexibilidad creo que los neum ticos pueden aguantar a una sola parada
7066452 quiz vayamos a elegir una estrategia a una sola parada y cruzando los dedos para que el coche de seguridad aparezca en el momento adecuado
7066453 la segunda plaza es una buena base para ma ana

7066478 taxpayers respond to this video not only because it is funny but also because they are outraged by politicians like scott garrett who kowtow to the interests of big oil instead of addressing the pain at the pump that were all facing
7066479 the shocking rise in energy prices is the direct result of big oil and their cronies like scott garrett blocking sound energy policy for years and the pain we are all enduring is no laughing matter but i believe that humor helps to highlight the absurdity of garrett talking about lowering gas prices while he is in the pocket of big oil opposing alternative energy at every turn while voting to protect big oils enormous tax breaks and windfall profits

7066491 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
7066492 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it i am fully aware he has got his thing on sept 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand

7066639 when i first got my drivers license i was told you have to have your drivers license with you at all times when you are driving ok now i vote religiously every election alright we vote laws in and it is voted by the general public and when we vote a law in the police officers have an obligation to enforce that law and the law says if you drive without a license you go to jail ok now i understand about the hardships and all but we can avoid the hardships if you just have your license with you
7066640 i think the cause is misconstrued ok i dont understand the cause i feel actually i feel like im being profiled because you know were speaking spanish and i dont understand it i wanna support how can i support something i dont understand ive lived in pomona for 36 years i wanna be a part of whats going on but coalition mans were all included ok thank you
7066641 the drivers license laws in california are a racist persecution of the community because people who are undocumented do not have the right to a drivers license
7066642 it is not possible to enforce a racist and unjust law in a good way
7066643 i think everybody has a chance to speak you have to stand in line
7066644 the people that cannot respect the rest of us were going to ask you to leave and if you dont leave were going to ask someone to take you out
7066645 im not gonna go that low to argue ok im here to unite my race ok
7066646 if you want to change this law you need to change it at the assembly level to say that it is a right to drive and that you can drive without a license
7066647 some of the checkpoints in pomona have been against what the ots grant because each checkpoint is to be conducted at a location that is the area of high traffic collisions some of the checkpoints conducted in pomona have not been in areas of high traffic collisions
7066648 the fact that we have people that speak spanish should not be something to be frightened of americans when they go on vacation to other countries they have to adjust to the language there and i think that its important for us to be more compassionate or thoughtful about the language barrier i think we can work through that and it only takes a generation and a half to really overcome that if were just patient also civil and respectful
7066649 they divide us into groups you see hispanics and anglos you see african americans and i think this is a country that weve said were unum expluribus one country made up of many different people diversity is here to stay whether we want it or not
7066650 there there was a checkpoint too and the police asked us have you drunk do you have any drugs you havent taken drugs no that was all they didnt ask us for licenses for insurance nothing so we need to do this the same way in pomona we have to fight for this
7066651 the world that right now is enjoying the best in athletic performance is the same world that wants the best for our environment
7066652 to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable and responsible growth coca cola has integrated our latest advances in climate protection and energy conservation into our beverage operations for the beijing 2008 olympic games
7066653 were addressing head on the key elements that affect the size of our carbon footprint and we have at least 5 600 solid examples of this effort spread throughout the official venues
7066654 this is the first time that every single cooler and vending machine provided by coca cola for the olympic games includes hfc free insulation and hfc free natural refrigerant
7066655 there are millions of orphans in the world growing up without mommies and dads they dont need to be in an orphanage they need to be in families
7066656 would you be willing to consider and even commit to doing some kind of emergency plan for orphans like president bush did with aids almost a presidents emergency plan to deal with this issue

7066662 the opening of the limnitis checkpoint is not connected to any other matter
7066663 we condemn all kinds of provocative actions that take place in that sensitive village of pyla wherever these may come from
7066664 our position regarding the issue of opening the limnitis checkpoint is well known and is not connected to anything else
7066665 we are working for the opening of the particular checkpoint as soon as possible because it will serve both the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots in the area
7066666 the repetition of the well known stance of the greek cypriots and the extension of the claims of the greek cypriot side for suzerainty on the island
7066667 the incident in pyla demonstrates the need for the presence of turkish troops on the island
7066668 we need the turkish troops to stay look whats happened

7066691 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7066692 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7066693 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7066694 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7066695 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7066696 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7066697 i had no idea he was saying he was on the olympic team

7066727 our agitation will be peaceful and it will be a movement for the suffering masses
7066728 i would like rsp and forward bloc to join the dharna
7066729 we have already offered a solution package to the west bengal government to resolve the crisis in the interest of both agriculture and industry
7066730 but ive asked my party workers not to go for confrontation
7066731 this government has to resolve the problem by conceding the demand of returning 400 acres
7066732 whenever they fail to fight me politically such allegations are leveled against me
7066733 starting from pole here for the first time is very nice
7066734 here it is not very easy the surface is very slippery so to make the perfect lap is difficult
7066735 i had a good lap and was able to secure the pole position i think i have a good car for the race tomorrow which will be very difficult but well try to do our best
7066736 i made the pole position in the first sector which was fantastic
7066737 i made some very small mistakes in sector two and i had a good sector three
7066738 we saw the lap times improving so quickly compared to the first session and the second session as long as we put rubber on the track the lap times improve a lot and also the balance improves a lot as well
7066739 yesterday there was a big shower which didnt help with the grip on the track i think its a nice track and i hope we can have a good one tomorrow
7066740 this is a bit better than i have been playing and i have to take it on from here
7066741 i have said all along i feel i have a lot to offer
7066742 with all the ankle operations and all the questions over me if i didnt think i could play this type of cricket i wouldnt have gone through it all again
7066743 it will only be through performances that ultimately i will be judged
7066744 i have not scored 50 for a while so it was nice to stick my bat up i didnt know what to do
7066745 kevin realises i have worked hard on my batting and i think he was just as pleased as i was
7066746 he wants me to play my natural game and the way in which he has seen me bat and knows i can do
7066747 you can play with no fear you can play with freedom but you cant be reckless
7066748 there is a balance for us all to find and hopefully the recklessness is behind me
7066749 i played to my strengths and was quite calculated in the way i played now i have to keep doing that
7066750 i got a few out of the middle early on and gave myself a chance by looking at a few
7066751 i have got a sound technique i feel and a method which has worked in the past
7066752 it is just building on that i have been working with phil on my balance making sure my head is not going over i have two eyes on the ball and i am playing it late
7066753 it was when kevin and i had been at the crease for a while when i decided to take it on a little bit more
7066754 it helped batting with him hes obviously a fine player and he can make things look easy at times
7066755 very single minded determined and that has rubbed off on the rest of the team
7066756 he is very up front with his views and the way he plays his cricket and as a team we are doing that well
7066757 for me as well i am back to a role which i feel comfortable in
7066758 i always enjoy playing with the big lad he is a class act
7066759 when he played at the oval his first over back gave the side a lift
7066760 when you have someone bowling that quick with that much bounce and you are into the opposition everyone gets a lift from it
7066761 it is nice to see him playing one day cricket again and smiling
7066762 coming back was up to him it was his decision but if he carries on the way he is doing he is going to help the sides success
7066763 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7066764 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7066765 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7066766 we will take indica vista in six months to international market

7066773 the gulf of mexico once went all the way to rush limbaughs doorstep in cape girardeau missouri when i think of the mississippi river i dont think of a line from minnesota to here i think of a cone that encompasses land from new york to the continental divide taos new mexico is as much the source of the river as minnesota
7066774 the port of tulsa cannot use the port of houston the port of pittsburgh cannot use the port of houston will lose its ability to export nationally and internationally
7066775 most of the sediment in the mississippi river comes out of the missouri river half of the sediment weve lost is sitting behind dams in the dakotas we dont get a damned bit of benefit from the dams in north and south dakota
7066776 those canals and pipelines are like taking an icepick to the ice accelerated erosion of the land
7066777 atchafalaya will become the main stream of the river but to prevent that the acoe built the old river control structure the bed of the river is well below sea level and the river is 100 to 200 feet deep in places

7066798 assisti melhor volta dele e como ele mesmo disse acabou com a gente no primeiro setor
7066799 apesar disso estou muito contente de largar da primeira fila ser importante largar bem e gostaria de me vingar de felipe que me ultrapassou em budapeste

7066806 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess
7066807 i think it will be very dangerous for singapore to assume that it has arrived in any sphere because the world is changing so fast in fact the world has never changed as fast as it is changing now and you will find that you will get competition from all kinds of new quarters coming in so its very important that we continue to be to use a cliche nimble flexible
7066808 singapore is probably better prepared than most cities in the world to handle the rise of asia because if the region is rising it needs a good financial sector it needs a good logistics centre it needs a good education centre it needs a good intellectual centre guess what singapore can provide a lot of these things
7066809 there are 3 5 billion people in asia maybe over 2 billion or so live in china and india but theres the rest of asia too i think southeast asia is going to become geopolitically much more relevant again in the years to come and there will be a lot more interest in southeast asia too

7066811 the best little man i ever saw on a football field he had tremendous quickness he was shifty and he was tough
7066812 he was the best broken field runner i ever coached
7066813 it came up a thunderstorm at halftime and just soaked the field
7066814 there was water standing nearly ankle deep along the sidelines alvin took the second half kickoff and broke loose down our side of the field he was plowing through that water and i was out there waving him on when he went by me he soaked me from head to toe
7066815 he was very much a team player our defense was structured around him and he had a knack for going to the ball he had the ability to shuck blockers and get to the ball carrier uam was very fortunate to have gotten him he could have played at a higher level
7066816 brenda was one of those rare athletes who come along once in a great while who seem to make the game look easy
7066817 brenda was one of the most complete players i ever coached she could take a game over by herself
7066818 she was a clutch player who was at her best in big games and crucial situations she was a joy to coach and just a special player
7066819 this institution has no better friend than reginald and i can think of no one more deserving of this honor
7066820 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7066821 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7066822 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7066823 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7066824 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7066825 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7066826 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7066827 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
7066828 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7066829 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help

7066843 las opciones de finalizar entre los cinco primeros dependen exclusivamente de la suerte es lo nico que nos queda saliendo de tan atr s duod cimo
7066844 a lo largo del fin de semana no ha habido ning n accidente fuerte y esperemos que siga todo igual pero varios pilotos han estado cerca de rozar el muro y si eso pasa en carrera implicar necesariamente la aparici n en pista del coche de seguridad
7066845 hoy no hemos sido suficientemente r pidos tenemos que mejorar empezando por la carrera de ma ana otras veces hemos logrado entrar en la q3 por d cimas pero en esta ocasi n nos ha tocado a nosotros quedarnos fuera no se ha podido hacer m s
7066846 la de ma ana ser una carrera en la que estamos en manos del coche de seguridad y de que aparezca cuando ya hayamos repostado de lo contrario s lo podremos finalizar en octava o novena posici n algo que no da demasiadas satisfacciones
7066847 hoy hice tres intentos al l mite el mejor y el peor estuvieron separados por dos d cimas as que es evidente que ah est mi limite no puedo esperar un milagro para ganar un segundo de repente es una pena porque estamos corriendo en casa
7066848 s lo me he quedado fuera de la q3 en dos ocasiones una en australia y otra en valencia muy a mi pesar a ver si lo podemos remediar de alguna manera seguro que ma ana se mejorar n los tiempos vuelta a vuelta porque la pista estar en mejores condiciones luego vendr el baile de los repostajes y ah veremos que estrategia elegimos
7066849 tenemos m s flexibilidad creo que los neum ticos pueden aguantar a una sola parada
7066850 el viernes tuvimos bastante desgaste en los neum ticos porque la pista estaba muy limpia y actuaba como una lija pero creo que ma ana aguantar n en mejores condiciones porque habr m s goma en la pista
7066851 esta noche o ma ana por la ma ana tendremos todos los datos estamos simulando carreras para ver c mo obtendr amos mejores resultados con dos paradas resulta m s r pido pero la simulaci n no tiene en cuenta la posible aparici n del coche de seguridad en pista
7066852 quiz vayamos a elegir una estrategia a una sola parada y cruzando los dedos para que el coche de seguridad aparezca en el momento adecuado
7066853 espero resarcirme de la mala suerte que tuve en hungr a

7066869 no existe una normativa que impida que una persona voluntariamente pueda bajarse del avi n
7066870 es el nico que tiene la capacidad de decidir sobre lo que ocurre a bordo del avi n tanto si se puede bajar como si no
7066871 con ello no quiero insinuar que la responsabilidad fue del comandante en alg n aspecto que pudo fallar sino que su facultad es la de evaluar la situaci n en cada vuelo
7066872 altamente cualificados pasando por rigurosos programas de formaci n continua
7066873 no nos consta en este momento por qu y bajo qu circunstancias algunas personas no pudieron bajar del avi n
7066874 problema en un sensor que toma la temperatura externa del avi n y que permite recibir informaci n para determinar si a su vez tiene que accionar otro tipo de cuestiones relativas al motor
7066875 decidi que ese lector no estaba registrando la temperatura adecuada y pidi regresar al hangar para que le hicieran una revisi n como se ala el procedimiento porque ning n vuelo de spanair se opera sin que el comandante tenga la plena confianza y seguridad de que ese avi n est en par metros adecuados para volar
7066876 plenamente recogido por el fabricante la compa a y los t cnicos de mantenimiento por lo que se certific y se document siguiendo normas reguladas por aviaci n espa ola y ese avi n sali en condiciones de seguridad ptimas
7066877 el comandante tiene la facultad de darle salida a ese vuelo y eso es lo que ocurri lo que pas despu s desafortunadamente no podemos especular ni entrar a hablar de ello porque es una competencia exclusiva de la comisi n de investigaci n
7066878 es normal que en cualquier compa a con el volumen de operaci n de spanair con 300 vuelos al d a y 10 millones de pasajeros al a o tengamos incidencias t cnicas pero para eso tenemos un complejo de infraestructuras y personal que est n plenamente avalados por las autoridades a trav s de inspecciones continuas para dar soluci n a cualquier problema
7066879 no existe ninguna duda de que la operaci n de spanair es segura como lo han evidenciado todas las informaciones y datos que hemos dado a las autoridades

7066984 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7066985 there has been no harsher critic of joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7066986 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7066987 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7066988 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable
7066989 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7066990 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house

7067001 coming into this poll i was frankly assuming that al franken was in trouble
7067002 hes had such a lousy string of damaging news reports
7067003 you couldnt image a candidate going through a worse time frankly if i was an oncologist and a patient presented this way i would say youre in trouble this could be fatal and indeed it looked really bad for franken and yet when we got the results of this poll it shows that franken and coleman are deadlocked
7067004 these angry voters are peeling off and supporting barkley and probably franken could be in the lead if he didnt have barkley in the race a big question is how does barkley do if he continues to gather steam its very hard to see how franken can win
7067005 i think theres a lot of mudslinging going around and you cant always know the truth and i need to know more before i can make a good decision
7067006 there are some warning signs in here for the franken campaign
7067007 the senate race is too much of throwing trash at each other i think
7067008 important issues the economy gas prices the iraq war afghanistan pakistan the decision is going to be based on who has the best answers to those questions i guess
7067009 when you ask voters who would do a better job on a variety of issues whether it be health care the economy and jobs ending the war in iraq franken does not have a discernable advantage on any of those issues
7067010 what youre seeing is that nationally voters think democrats do in fact have answers and would do a better job on these issues

7067014 the department is disappointed with the results although this is the first year and it does take time to put in a new assessment
7067015 the first year of any new test the test scores are likely to be probably the lowest youll see just because teachers are still trying to get familiar with the tests students are still trying to get familiar with the tests

7067078 i didnt want to leave with silver i wanted gold since these are my last olympics
7067079 we connected on two home runs but they were both solo shots
7067080 it was an insult to the olympic vision to the spirit of taekwondo and for me an insult to mankind

7067084 i worked all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7067085 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7067086 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof

7067088 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7067089 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me

7067114 pemilihan biden ini mengecewakan karena dia adalah pencipta pembagian irak
7067115 kami tetap menolak usulan itu pembagian wilayah justru membuat persoaln di irak akan terus muncul
7067116 ide itu seperti di bosnia menciptakan persatuan irak dengan melakukan desentralisasi membagi berdasarkan kelompok agama
7067117 in all the deaths the common problem is that these workers were not wearing or did not have their safety gear or ppes personal protective equipment either they were not given any or they werent using it for some reason
7067118 poor judgment on the part of the worker or workers involved in an accident and or negligence on the part of hanjin or its subcontractors
7067119 we found out that ut corp was using fraudulent documents while conducting our investigation into de la cruzs death also they were not giving their workers the proper benefits or paying their sss social security system contributions plus most of their workers did not have the proper safety gear like de la cruz
7067120 without the registration they subcontractors cannot work for those subcontractors who have expired registrations they can continue operating in the free port there is automatic renewal if they have no violations
7067121 shipped our jobs oversees wrongly started the war in iraq and destroyed our economy
7067122 i made a very precise hit at the start and then i never let the initiative slip away from me

7067124 some of my team mates went shopping and sightseeing in beijing well i did not because my coaches and my father told me to focus on boxing
7067125 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7067126 if the heir is not worthy of his money the only person threatened by it is himself a free competitive economy is a constant process of improvement innovation progress it does not tolerate stagnation if an heir who lacks ability acquires a fortune and a great industrial establishment from his father he will not be to maintain it for long he will not be equal to the competition in a free economy where bureaucrats and legislators would not have the power to sell or grant economic favors all the heirs money would not be able to buy him protection for his incompetence he would have to be good at his work or lose his customers to companies run by men of superior ability there is nothing as vulnerable as a large mismanaged company that competes with small efficient ones the personal luxuries or drunken parties that the incompetent heir may enjoy on his fathers money are of no economic significance in business he would not be able to stand in the way of talented competitors or serve as an impediment to men of ability he would find no automatic security anywhere
7067127 it is significant how many heirs of great industrial fortunes the second and third generation millionaires are welfare statists clamoring for more and more controls the target and victims of these controls are the men of ability who in a free economy would displace these heirs the men with whom the heirs would be unable to compete
7067128 p d la baja calidad de las pel culas en el cine puede ser una de las causas por la que cada d a la gente vaya menos
7067129 the man was taken to hospital where he remains in serious condition
7067130 there is something about hitler and germany that somehow makes it difficult to feel sorry for them when they get slaughtered at football you just think hitler hitler hitler hitler hitler
7067131 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7067132 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7067133 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches

7067136 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
7067137 there is a magic to football that is about the fact that you cant touch it with your hands
7067138 it was fortunate for soccer in canada that only four years before confederation there took place in england an agreement on rules that were immediately available for adoption in the early days of the sport here in the sparsely settled new dominion the game was played wherever expatriate britons went except for the earliest playing of kicking ball before 1863 the immigrants arrived with accepted rules and there was nothing to unlearn
7067139 some people think football is a matter of life and death i can assure them it is much more serious than that
7067140 there are things in it that embarrass me but i would certainly defend it i dont think its a very good novel it wasnt a book about books but it came out of my experience of books rather than out of my experience of living it was i guess you could say a tribute to the reading i liked
7067141 violent and tasteless episodes give evidence of originality and a good eye and ear
7067142 with this novel out of his system mr richlers second one may be an entirely mature and rewarding book
7067143 in the end the book sold something more than 900 copies i had not earned my original advance against royalties and my family began to apply pressure again advertising my uncle jake wrote thats where the money is i borrowed a copy of your book the other day my old friend herby wrote and i think its terrible maybe you shouldnt write under your own name my uncle sydney wrote after all the family my father wrote that he made the night watchman buy a copy but he didnt care for it himself i wouldnt recommend it for children he wrote
7067144 if as keats put it beauty is truth truth beauty then there must be beauty in mordecai richlers candid novel of juvenile delinquents in the jewish slum district of montreal for the ring of truth is the one clear note to be found in a book that is sometimes hilariously funny sometimes brutally pathetic and often unnecessarily vulgar
7067145 the train jumped the tracks there and eight cars are on the ground all over the place up there
7067146 there are a lot of nice vehicles on them were a lot of nice vehicles
7067147 a lot of them are damaged i couldnt tell you how many its just however many they stuff in car that many are on the ground
7067148 both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti aircraft guns my children and i took cover under our beds and we stayed for three hours til the situation subsided
7067149 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7067150 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7067151 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7067152 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7067153 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles
7067154 there is a chance of escalation over the black sea feet
7067155 the nato countries continue to step up their presence i dont think this will help to stabilize the situation in the region
7067156 they had this wild punk singer who would destroy pianos by jumping on them with high heeled boots
7067157 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7067158 we will have to see what other issues were present
7067159 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7067160 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7067161 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7067162 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7067163 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7067164 both sides using a lot of heavy guns including anti aircraft guns my children and i took cover under our beds and we stayed for three hours til the situation subsided
7067165 hier gibt es derzeit eine menge widerspr chlicher str mungen

7067167 es ist wichtig daran zu denken dass es sich um die letzte augustwoche handelt
7067168 if i knew then what i know now i would have never voted for it
7067169 i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it
7067170 itulah sebabnya mengapa saya bisa mengontrol ke 86 istri saya
7067171 dari ke 86 istri saya tak satupun yang saya mencarinya semuanya mencari saya dan minta dinikahi dan kembali seperti yang saya katakan bahwa ini adalah karunia tuhan jadi saya rela menikahi mereka begitupun sebaliknya
7067172 i want to get drug tested over and over again
7067173 obviously its inconvenient but i tell you what its inconvenient if people affect you by cheating
7067174 test me as much as you need to and follow me around as much as you need to
7067175 i think about the 99 9 per cent of athletes that are clean so we have to make sure that we keep the playing field level im very happy with the many tests that were taken before and during the games
7067176 we are telling the cheats there wont be a possibility to cheat anymore
7067177 athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organization running the doping programs means business when it comes to not having those who cheat be part of this event
7067178 i wouldnt want to find out that one of the guys i was racing against doesnt get drug tested on a regular basis because i certainly do i offer my urine to any takers that can see it so that they know that im a clean athlete and i follow the rules
7067179 i live and breathe and die by the rules of this sport and cherish drug free sport more than anything because i think cheating is just a total demolition of the construct on which sport was based it disgusts me to think that people would cheat so im absolutely happy to provide my sample at any time
7067180 were making progress but we need to change our culture too
7067181 okay this is a big mental boost for any sales professional then ask again with a different close i want our sales people to persist like that

7067204 dick cheney hat george bush junior schon bei dessen wahl im jahr 2000 geholfen da wussten die leute dass sich der unerfahrene bush mit erfahrenen leuten umgeben w rde die wissen wie die welt und washington funktioniert
7067205 einige leute sehen was ich so tue und denken dass ich der darth vader dieser regierung bin
7067206 cheney war der wichtigste und einflussreichste vizepr sident den wir jemals hatten zum ersten mal wird von einem kaiserlichen vizepr sidenten gesprochen aber ich denke dass cheneys vizepr sidentschaft langfristig nichts ndern und auch nicht wiederholt werden wird
7067207 dazu gibt es berhaupt gar keine veranlassung unsere liebe ist nach sechs jahren ehe noch st rker und intensiver geworden
7067208 ich vertraue marc auf ganzer linie und habe absolut keinen grund zur eifersucht

7067229 the developing worlds demand for energy and cheap fossil fuels will continue to rise

7067242 the market is open until the 1st of september and for us it remains open both concerning players coming in and players leaving at the moment however i am satisfied with the 20 players i have available for me they are the 20 best players in the world
7067243 im john mccain and i do not approve of all this but we know he wont he will be happy to let it fester and ferment as long as he can get a single vote out of it while washing his hands like pilate and blaming it all on someone else
7067244 i waited to speak to the player when he returned from international duty and made a decision about whether or not he was right to play
7067245 i have not selected him as i do not think he is focused enough and i do not feel that he will be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7067246 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game
7067247 i didnt know you were allowed to do that to this song isnt there a union rule or something

7067331 he would terminate his contract and the courts would decide what he has to pay we want robinho to stay at madrid but this situation leaves us unable to do anything
7067332 would never retain a player against his wishes so we have no alternative to accept the unilateral rescinding of his contract
7067333 he can leave as early as possible but he must accept the consequences of rescinding a contract which has two years to run

7067344 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard

7067346 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7067347 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7067348 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work

7067382 the picture quality presents the original 1 33 1 ratio non anamorphically and has a decent level of clarity but veers wildly in quality from scene to scene some look fine considering the age of the film though others in particular those set in the courtroom are very badly scratched the sound fares better presenting the original japanese mono with burnt in english subtitles over two speakers only occasionally suffering from crackling

7067399 theyre more focused in prayer theyre more focused on one to one evangelism particularly the government church because religious freedom does not allow anyone to go out to the street you have religious freedom inside the church not outside the church

7067483 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
7067484 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
7067485 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
7067486 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
7067487 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
7067488 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer

7067497 you cant have an israeli policy other than what aipac gives you around here

7067565 aprobado por el ex presidente del gobierno jos mar a aznar y el ppcv ha llevado al
7067566 por primera vez los pilares comunes de un modelo de financiaci n que se soporta en la autonom a financiera de las comunidades aut nomas y en criterios de solidaridad y cohesi n territorial para fortalecer espa a
7067567 el pp y en especial los populares valencianos apuestan por obstaculizar cualquier soluci n aplicando el cuanto peor mejor
7067568 mismo modo que ha venido diciendo que un gobierno que no reconoce que hay crisis dif cilmente puede resolverla un consell que no admite que el fracaso del actual modelo de financiaci n es responsabilidad suya dif cilmente puede ofrecer y pedir soluciones
7067569 se desboc con la llegada del ex jefe del consell eduardo zaplana
7067570 sus sucesores jos luis olivas y francisco camps no s lo no han corregido el problema sino que lo han encubierto y tratan de echar la culpa al aumento de poblaci n
7067571 de 1995 a 2002 aument en 5 743 millones de euros situ ndose en 8 399 millones y de 2002 a 2008 en 4 919 millones lo que la eleva hasta los actuales 13 318 mllones
7067572 fue de 820 4 millones al a o en tanto que la del segundo fue de 819 8
7067573 ritmo de crecimiento de la deuda es id ntico pese al mill n m s de habitantes
7067574 o esconden cifras en los cajones o la variaci n de la poblaci n es una excusa para disimular la p sima gesti n que el consell hace de los recursos de todos los valencianos o el aumento de la poblaci n se traduce en una disminuci n de los servicios y de su calidad
7067575 modificar y mejorar el modelo para evitar cometer los mismos errores que cometi el pp
7067576 es anterior a la implantaci n del modelo de financiaci n
7067577 comenz a desbocarse con la entrada de los gobiernos del pp

7067597 he said i swear if one more little kid comes up to me and says james can i get your autograph
7067598 when you have such a great linebacker like james its tough to be in that spotlight but at the same time you get an opportunity that a lot of people want to see him play and youre able to showcase your talent

7067617 the early christians were having a lot of difficulty getting people to join their movement
7067618 the law in its previous imperative is not is no longer tenable even for those who claim to follow it it is a principle of death for the suddenly ascendant truth badiou p 27
7067619 a shift from concern with this world toward preoccupation with the supposed next world p 81
7067620 this whole story of how the jews were the ones responsible for jesus being crucified is very improbable
7067621 was worked into the christian tradition about a century after the death of jesus
7067622 as a military outpost and instrument of u s imperialism in the world
7067623 in the christian world life has been hell to all those who have refused to practice christianity
7067624 have i gone into this to such an extent p 81
7067625 is the allah of islam any different in any meaningful way from
7067626 a smugly arrogant attitude towards religious fundamentalism and religion in general
7067627 it is a deep form of contempt for the masses to fail to take seriously the deep belief that many of them have in religion
7067628 in the fight against injustice and oppression to unite as broadly as possible with people who continue to hold religious beliefs
7067629 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life
7067630 what it is actually putting forward and what it is actually promoting p 122
7067631 underlying this very verse is the notion that humanity is all screwed up thats the first point to keep in mind here
7067632 was not a supernatural being part of the same substance of god the father and at the same time the son of god
7067633 here i wont attempt to further explore the arcane christian doctrine of the trinity
7067634 and then theres this whole matter of the holy spirit
7067635 role is to be the loving long suffering mother of jesus
7067636 a kind of intercessor for people in their supplications to god
7067637 a powerful father figure in a human form is not enough for many people
7067638 the image of an all knowing all seeing all powerful god for whom lo the powerful head of state is a representative
7067639 let us be clear female children and children in general should not be seen and treated as the property of their parents and their father in particular
7067640 an unmistakable suggestion of a final solution against the masses of people in the inner cities
7067641 i didnt come here to tell you what you want to hear
7067642 oppressed people who are unable or unwilling to confront reality as it actually is are condemned to remain enslaved and oppressed
7067643 the most prophetic intellectual and spiritual leader of our generation
7067644 family values agenda with an spiritually based anti war pro science progressive agenda of their own avakian concedes there is much on which to unite with lerner p 160 but criticizes him on a number of points
7067645 vast majority are motivated by principles and who want what is best for the world
7067646 is true because it is effective not because it gives us factual information but because it gives us deeper insight into the meaning of life
7067647 but shouldnt one ask why following the defeat of the socialist revolutions in the ussr and china people have flocked to religious movements why were the efforts to inculcate atheism so disappointingly partial and so quickly reversible might they have been too crudely and insensitively applied based on imperfect analysis of this phenomenon of religious belief
7067648 this new synthesis involves a recasting and recombining of the positive aspects of the experience so far of the communist movement and of socialist society while learning from the negative aspects of this experience in the philosophical and ideological as well as the political dimensions so as to have a more deeply and firmly rooted scientific orientation method and approach with regard not only to making revolution and seizing power but then yes to meeting the material requirements of society and the needs of the masses of people in an increasingly expanding way in socialist society overcoming the deep scars of the past and continuing the revolutionary transformation of society while at the same time actively supporting the world revolutionary struggle and acting on the recognition that the world arena and the world struggle are most fundamental and important in an overall sense together with opening up qualitatively more space to give expression to the intellectual and cultural needs of the people broadly understood and enabling a more diverse and rich process of exploration and experimentation in the realms of science art and culture and intellectual life overall with increasing scope for the contention of different ideas and schools of thought and for individual initiative and creativity and protection of individual rights including space for individuals to interact in civil society independently of the state all within an overall cooperative and collective framework and at the same time as state power is maintained and further developed as a revolutionary state power serving the interests of the proletarian revolution in the particular country and worldwide with this state being the leading and central element in the economy and in the overall direction of society while the state itself is being continually transformed into something radically different from all previous states as a crucial part of the advance toward the eventual abolition of the state with the achievement of communism on a world scale
7067649 and a lot of marxist writers could learn a lot stylistically from early avakian you can explain complex ideas to the masses in simple language you dont have to mutter in jargonese to do it
7067650 who spent a lot of time at expensive ivy league universities
7067651 we shouldnt understand this principle im articulating in a fill in the blank with seven different synonyms for
7067652 by combining a mostly positive but critical assessment of this history with some new ideas about what socialism ought to be in the future
7067653 zizek and other philosophers do not write for the masses
7067654 the big words are used to exclude certain people the great mass of people actually from the conversation
7067655 remember its us the working class who are going to have to carry out the revolution thats going to be needed to make those ideas a material force
7067656 well we dont thing socialism is possible until the far distant future so for now were fighting for capitalism an elected president and developement through foreign owned sweatshops thats what we want you to pick up a rifle and fight and die for
7067657 voting for the democratic party because we think they are the lesser of two evils
7067658 you cant be a gay communist cause we dont like being around gay people and the straight masses dont like gay folks either
7067659 i happen to believe that you can explain quite complicated ideological concepts in everyday language
7067660 i happen to believe that you can explain quite complicated ideological concepts in everyday language

7067680 whatever the case is with his own selfishness the evidence of an internationally superior american generosity is impressive beginning with the numbers on our charitable giving we give twice as much as the british per capita and according to the american magazine seven times as much as the germans and 14 times as much as the italians even in inflation adjusted dollars the amount given each year just keeps getting larger and meanwhile we do far more volunteer work than in other industrialized countries

7067725 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7067726 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7067727 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7067728 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7067729 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7067730 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7067731 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7067732 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7067733 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7067734 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7067735 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7067738 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7067739 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7067740 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7067741 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7067742 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7067743 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7067744 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7067745 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7067746 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7067747 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7067748 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7067749 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7067750 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7067751 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7067752 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7067753 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7067756 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7067757 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7067758 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7067759 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7067760 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

7067763 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7067780 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7067781 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7067782 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7067783 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7067784 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7067788 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7067789 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7067790 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7067791 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7067792 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7067793 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7067794 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7067795 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7067796 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7067797 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7067798 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7067799 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7067807 its important to take risks and start investing in some strategic relationships with someone we know who doesnt rate us well or doesnt hold a high opinion of us
7067808 our evidence suggests that the key factor is being outdoors and that it does not matter if that time is spent in having a picnic or in playing sport
7067809 both will protect a childs eyes from growing excessively which is the major cause of myopia
7067810 we have not yet established why being outside is protective
7067811 but a likely candidate is the high levels of light experienced outside compared to inside studies in animals suggest that retinal dopamine is released in response to light and dopamine is known to be able to block eye growth

7067818 as water becomes a scarce resource we need additional sources
7067819 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
7067820 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
7067821 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
7067822 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralises their potential benefits
7067823 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolising enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
7067824 we have discovered a new pathway that modulates sleep and arousal

7067831 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7067832 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7067861 the realization of what he had been asked to do hit me like a punch to the gut
7067862 it was an honour for him he told me that although he didnt know the soldier he had delivered the news of his passing to the soldiers family and felt as if he knew them after many conversations in so few days
7067863 so heres a public thank you to our military men and women for what you do so we can live the way we do
7067864 someone has come up with a very powerful narrative thats very affecting thats plausible to support the cause
7067865 through our research this story has been circulating for years and is coming from an unknown source
7067866 there are enough real stories of heroism and honour and its not necessary to make up stories such as this
7067867 i think this story is addressing a perceived need by the military by military families and those who support the military and want to see something thats more positive about them in the public consciences
7067868 in q1 i thought it was d ja vu when timo glock was in my way
7067869 our team informs us on the radio how many seconds behind us a fast car is and when we have to let somebody overtake
7067870 i was afraid my qualifying would be ruined but luckily i was able to do a second lap straight away and it was good enough
7067871 qualifying eighth is not perfect but i think it was about the maximum possible today as the fuel load comes into play
7067872 q2 was fine as i was third fastest and could see the pace was there
7067873 generally speaking im a lot happier with my car today
7067874 on friday i was struggling a lot but we have made a lot of changes since
7067875 my best result ever so i am pleased as it has taken a bit of time to improve on my p7 that i did in my first grand prix 2007 us grand prix
7067876 we made some changes to the set up overnight and they all turned out to be positive
7067877 the team worked hard to make the most of the data
7067878 we didnt expect to do this well here but its a good thing to have both cars in q3
7067879 my last lap should have been a bit better but i made a mistake in turn 12 locking the rear under braking
7067880 now we have to keep our feet on the ground because there are a lot of laps ahead of us tomorrow
7067881 im looking forward to the race when i think we have a real chance to score points
7067882 i am still having my problem of not finding grip on the
7067883 but i am happy that our performance is getting better
7067884 im really pleased to be in q3 for the first time
7067885 its a good feeling as i kept waiting to hear that i dropped down to 11 or 12 in q2
7067886 what we have seen here is that on a new track some teams have worked in the right direction and some have not
7067887 the team did a good job of giving me a car that was one of the best today
7067888 now it is up to me to get the most out of it in the race its bound to be a tough race but i hope to be in a position to fight for points after making a good start
7067889 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7067890 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly
7067891 i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start
7067892 we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7067893 it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result
7067894 all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts
7067895 tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat
7067896 we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur
7067897 the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers
7067898 on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time

7067900 what can i report to do the most to help americas voters learn about and weigh their choice this fall
7067901 i got a call from a friend around 3 30 and was told that things had taken a turn for the worst
7067902 so i headed back into the hospital along with football coach mike propst and we stayed until about 5 30
7067903 from what i understand when i left him this morning it was a serious brain injury
7067904 i have not talked to the family since he has gone on life support but it was a very serious brain injury and it just doesnt look real good
7067905 when i left him last night he was still breathing on his own i have heard that he had gotten even worse than that
7067906 i got to know matt a little bit through his project and i have been impressed with his perseverance on his project
7067907 bob and lisa are good friends and words cannot describe what kind of tragedy this is
7067908 the show of support for the family the show of love for the family was very touching but the fact that you are there on pins and needles for a 15 year old kid it tears at you literally tears at you
7067909 its a once in a lifetime one in a million hit for this to happen to a healthy kid he was healthy and well padded he was still breathing on the field but basically they said the damage was done right then and there i have never heard of anything like it

7067921 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7067922 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7067923 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7067924 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7067925 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7067926 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7067927 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7067928 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7067929 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7067930 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7067931 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
7067932 then why doesnt bush and why dont you try to get that legislation changed
7067933 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7067934 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7067935 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems
7067936 which is cooler a truck which can transform into a giant talking robot and fight to protect humanity or a hero inspired by tinman in alice in wonderland

7067945 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company
7067946 customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages
7067947 now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heart warming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages

7067953 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7067954 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7067955 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7067956 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7067957 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7067958 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7067959 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7067960 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7067961 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7067962 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7067963 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7067964 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7067965 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7067966 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7067967 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7067968 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7067969 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7067970 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7067971 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7067972 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7067973 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7067974 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7067975 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7067976 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7067977 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7067978 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7067979 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7067980 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7067981 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7067982 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done we have our team but we also have our work cut out for us barack obama and joe biden are the leaders who will bring the change our country needs but they cant do it alone show your support for the obama biden ticket by making a donation today
7067983 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7067984 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as we are on a street course anything is possible in the race
7067985 we must continue working hard this evening to try and work out the best strategy that will allow us to be ready for all eventualities tomorrow such as a safety car period which seems quite likely
7067986 we cannot forget that in 2003 when i started to race with renault and started winning and finishing on the podium the national television was not even broadcasting the races live
7067987 zardari est de acuerdo con ser el candidato a la presidencia
7067988 the only way to stop this war is to cut off funding everything else is small talk and unless youre willing to do that you will not be the democratic nominee
7067989 in a world this dangerous with a crisis as tough as iraq hard truths need to be told joe biden says this war must end now
7067990 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7067991 i hope you will support my work on amtrak as much as i have supported you
7067992 youve not been good to me youre also damn selfish you better listen to me
7067993 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7067994 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7067995 well i think first of all the administration has said very clearly and publicly that there will be no trade offs
7067996 trade offs like that are kind of a relic of a bygone era of power politics
7067997 2024 president biden now 82 and in the last year of his second term didnt even open the mornings economic report it would be the same as the one before it and the one before that he no longer read them anymore with the depression now in its tenth year his mind often drifted back to the glory days of 14 or 15 years ago when everything seemed so sure and it was just he and barack against the world when unemployment figures of over 20 had driven the president out of his mind he had been forced as vp to take the helm but to no avail as tax increases and new programs didnt seem to right the ship he
7067998 ill bet its a lot easier to rile biden than mccain
7067999 show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction
7068000 im not so sure about that while there has certainly been the usual hawkish rhetoric ive documented during the past week what appears to be a significant degree of dissent from neocon orthodoxy in this current turn of events
7068001 obama is about the lowest road candidate ive ever seen
7068002 ive had a great relationship with indian americans in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7068003 its been like this all my life nothing has changed im getting lost here
7068004 we hope to extract about 30 million ounces of silver over the next 10 years and we hope well find more down there
7068005 they call it a ghost town but there are no ghosts here
7068006 at times one feels very alone here everyone who lives here is a family but we need more people
7068007 the local residents were worried about traffic and noise and their water supply cyanide understandably they dont want their lifestyle changed they were looking for jobs
7068008 there will be changes but were trying to not be disruptive we intend to be good neighbors and shafter will continue to be shafter
7068009 i think the chronology indicates other factors are reducing the flow in the creek
7068010 as you can imagine people who move to a place like shafter value their peace and quiet so in a perfect world id rather nothing change
7068011 i knew when i moved here that it was in a mining district so theres always been a sense we were on borrowed time that the mine would reopen
7068012 the problem with the mining company as friendly as it is its a very big dog for the neighborhood
7068013 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
7068014 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
7068015 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
7068016 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
7068017 during the depression the mines closed and many people moved away but the mine reopened and it was the best time for the miners they could buy cars and phonographs they had dances and nice gatherings
7068018 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
7068019 they had words howell was ready with his gun and when speed tried to pull his howell shot him some thought he was defending himself
7068020 in one way it would be good for jobs for the people i know there will be changes no more quiet days and nights but i believe it will be all right
7068021 should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles
7068022 i was raised at a time when the catholic church was fertile with new ideas and open discussion about some of the basic social teaching of the catholic church
7068023 he led me to see that if you cannot defend your faith to reason then you have a problem
7068024 has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women
7068025 help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate
7068026 catholic and working class roots have been a source of solidarity for him with hard working american families who are suffering the most from the current economic crisis
7068027 any public discussion of whether life begins at conception can only help the pro life cause because the scientific facts are hard to deny
7068028 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7068029 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7068030 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7068031 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7068032 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7068033 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7068034 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7068035 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7068036 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7068037 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7068038 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7068039 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7068040 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7068041 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7068042 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7068043 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7068044 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7068045 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7068046 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7068047 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7068048 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7068049 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7068050 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7068051 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7068052 the first debate is going to be a game of country not a country ill give mccain czechoslovakia since hes proven three times that hell never get that one right
7068053 taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back
7068054 common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate
7068055 im sorry the iranians are training extremists not al qaeda
7068056 the good news about having biden as my vp is that we wont have to be on the same podium for my speeches in the middle east
7068057 its a good thing mccain doesnt have to worry about remembering which of his 12 houses he left his blackberry in
7068058 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7068059 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7068060 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7068061 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7068062 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7068063 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7068064 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7068065 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7068066 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7068067 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7068068 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7068069 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7068070 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7068071 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7068072 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7068073 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7068074 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7068075 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7068076 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7068077 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7068078 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7068079 if you dont want nuclear waste here you dont want john mccain here
7068080 he cares about his state he really doesnt care about nevada
7068081 john mccain says hes opposed to nuclear waste going through arizona but he wants to dump it here in nevada
7068082 senator mccains point was it has to be done safely
7068083 he doesnt want to truck it through any state if its unsafe thats irresponsible whether its phoenix or las vegas it has to be done with all the concerns addressed
7068084 the choice this presidential election could not be more clear
7068085 senator mccain has been a leading proponent in favor of storage of nuclear waste at yucca mountain his entire career he speaks about it he brags about it he wants it no bones about it senator obama has stated inside the state of nevada and outside the state of nevada if he is elected this project is dead
7068086 when i hear the word elitist to me that is a code word for uppity and i find it extremely offensive
7068087 john mccain should know better thats a code word for uppity black man and thats beneath the dignity of every american
7068088 me encant el titulo que no diga la palabra batman la interpretaci n de batman que hicimos chris y yo es muy diferente a todas las anteriores que siempre tuvieron a batman en su titulo creo que es como tomar distancia diciendo

7068093 batman es uno de los personajes de la cultura pop mas extraordinarios y queremos que the joker haga una entrada verdaderamente grandilocuente no existe comparaci n tecnol gica con este formato en t rminos de llevar a la audiencia dentro de la acci n el imax permite al espectador zambullirse en la pel cula quisiera rodar todo el film de esta manera estoy muy orgulloso y excitado al usar esta tecnolog a de la manera en la que nadie lo hizo antes
7068094 chris comparte nuestra visi n de que la experiencia f lmica deber a transportar a las audiencias a la acci n

7068105 do not let my cry find a hiding place in you
7068106 the sprinkled blood that calls out more eloquently than abels
7068107 the voice of your brothers blood cries our to me from the earth
7068108 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7068109 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7068110 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7068111 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean
7068112 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7068113 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7068114 this is what is going to happen now georgia is going to accelerate its march toward nato and i hope to an action plan in december
7068115 russia has shown exactly why georgia needs to be in nato russia did not lift a finger against the baltic states once they entered nato it would not lift a finger against ukraine if ukraine were in nato the same goes for georgia
7068116 we need georgia and ukraine in nato to deter these kinds of tragic military adventures on the part of russia when it feels it has some room to potentially block the accession of these countries to nato
7068117 ill bet the russian government will want to keep some troops in those areas we are not in favour of that and i dont know how we can call them peacekeepers
7068118 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7068119 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7068120 you know there will be three days in the campaign where someone in chicago will get a call and respond what did you say he said
7068121 i think i have a much higher iq than you do

7068126 they began to shoot at us they threw bombs and we started to leave i was hurt on one of my legs my back and my head
7068127 i am scared but im going to confront them if they want to kill me then they can do that as long as they leave the land to my children
7068128 not only raposa serra do sol would be at risk but all indigenous reservations in the country
7068129 several of them went to prison but they were only in for a short time since they have money and political influence with which they are able to turn these cases into interminable legal disputes
7068130 a declared war on indigenous people by groups that have economic interests on their lands
7068131 the non indians arrived and invaded our land they started to hire us on their haciendas but when an indian would ask for his wages he would get a beating and would be thrown out
7068132 we were enslaved to buy a hammock we had to work for an entire month
7068133 amazonia is in brazil but the problem is a global one of concern to anyone who defends life
7068134 it doesnt only come from agribusiness but also from public works like roads hydroelectric plants or dikes
7068135 the last agricultural frontier on which agribusiness has its sights
7068136 we will see a major modification of the landscape here of water resources and the fauna and flora as a result of the rice plantations the agrotoxics used by the landowners are polluting the rivers and hurting the aquatic fauna
7068137 all the poison all the residues from the processing of rice are dumped into the rivers
7068138 indigenous lands will not survive unless there is an ecological and economic realignment of the country and of amazonia
7068139 brazil is the only country named after an almost extinct tree
7068140 as indigenous people we are going to defend nature because that is our conception of life that cosmogonic view of the world for the future of humanity
7068141 ive been able to represent my country since i was 24 years old its been just awesome
7068142 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7068143 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7068144 we mainly use the photos for relays to determine disqualifications if someone dives in before a teammate touches
7068145 this is the only sport where athletes dont cross the finish line the athlete stops
7068146 this is very simple our sport is about which athlete stops the time by pushing the touchpad
7068147 in our sport we dont have photo finishes like in athletics in our sport its who touches first water is a different element
7068148 we have 11 days left before the transfer deadline and we are working at something but you never know in football
7068149 it may happen it may not if it doesnt we will carry on with what we have got
7068150 wayne does too much around the pitch at the expense of what he does up front
7068151 it is a waste of his energy to chase back to our own penalty area for instance
7068152 but it is not something to worry about too much it is purely down to enthusiasm and natural energy he just loves playing football
7068153 with keane where the ball was he wanted to be there
7068154 dont forget wayne is only 22 we hope to channel what he does
7068155 his natural affection for the game will help him too
7068156 i sincerely hope really bad things happen to you in proportion to the poison you spread on the net unless you repent and id still spit on you

7068161 i dont know of any developing world ngo nongovernmental organization that has been more successful
7068162 certainly in terms of the issues they work on theyre more like a minigovernment if i were giving out nobel prizes there is no doubt i would give it to abed

7068169 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
7068170 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
7068171 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7068172 well its about time ive been waiting for some time for someone to to be alone here at night even tried adding thorazine to the coffee but it didnt seem to have an effect on anyone so tell me your name young man
7068173 nice to meet you stuart can i call you stu that would make things so much easier for me anyway stu i have a job for you
7068174 i know i was briefed on it this afternoon you want me to use
7068175 no not that well i mean not right now well still need to see those historical shipping tables on friday this is another task for you it wont take long
7068176 i think its time to go home besides ive never driven a car on dream should be pretty cool
7068177 you must complete my task mr sutcliffe dont make me demonstrate my power
7068178 look i have power too see its a nifty button here labeled power i wonder whatll happen if i press it
7068179 i need you to go fishing i need you to go get a fishing pole and catch a fish once you catch a fish you need to bring it back here
7068180 well that doesnt sound hard i hope you dont want me to catch a flounder there arent any around here
7068181 no its not a flounder it will be a female bluegill and you need to bring it here alive
7068182 you have to catch the fish at the confluence of the rivers
7068183 you mean wolf point thats in the city i dont have to go that far theres plenty of places to catch fish around here
7068184 no it must be at the confluence and you must return by sunrise
7068185 so what are you going to do with this bluegill i mean am i going to get into any trouble
7068186 when i was bestowed the crown of being the founder of flounder it came with a curse brought on by a posiden like entity that is way too deep for children to understand if i wish to continue my success in harvesting flounder i need to release a virgin bluegill into the fish tank behind the front desk once this happens there will be a virgin birth and then those bluegill need to released back in the confluence
7068187 um im not waiting around for the full gestation of a bluegill and how can i tell if theyre a virgin
7068188 you cant tell if shes a virgin that has been our downfall many times our agents have returned with bluegill but none proved to be virgins one marketing idiot did bring back a virgin catfish though that was pretty tasty thats when we started the bayou line of catfish nuggets
7068189 so i have to spend alnight catching a bluegill to bring it back here only to find out its not a virgin shouldnt i just bring a bunch of bluegill
7068190 no it has to be only one thats in the manual only when it returns will we know if its a virgin
7068191 it has a great beat and you can really dance to it i give it a seventy five

7068221 there is a new de centeredness that has come into play in the art world and it coincides with the so called rise of the rest which means vocalization of positions and perspectives that differ from the western position

7068275 it was highly foreseeable that ramos upon his return to the streets of san francisco would murder men who appeared to be latinos or african americans
7068276 there are clearly many many restrictions on when and whether san francisco police officers can communicate with the federal government on an individuals immigration status and those restrictions played a role in a significant way to horrible events that unfolded on june 22
7068277 it was just a horrific tragedy because it was preventable
7068278 if the city had followed the law anthony matthew and michael bologna would most certainly be alive today
7068279 all of these official enactments orders mandates and endorsements of sanctuary policies were reinforced by an unwritten but enforced policy that discouraged police officers from reporting any illegal alien

7068302 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7068303 today is another important victory in the fight to preserve equal access to opportunity as was the case in oklahoma and missouri ward connerlys misguided and divisive effort has again fallen short this time in arizona in light of the staggering disqualification rate that the secretary of state found in its review of the signatures the curtain has been pulled back on connerlys attempts to abuse the democratic process
7068304 a sort of mixture of mozart toscanini horatio alger hero and frank sinatra
7068305 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7068306 senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7068307 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from senator biden on the issues important to our community
7068308 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7068309 if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

7068316 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7068317 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7068318 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7068319 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7068320 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7068321 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7068322 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7068323 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7068324 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7068326 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7068327 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7068328 this is a planning took where all things are going
7068329 the correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom
7068330 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7068331 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7068332 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7068333 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7068334 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7068335 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7068336 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7068337 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7068338 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7068339 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7068340 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store

7068382 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7068383 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7068384 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7068385 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

7068396 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7068397 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7068398 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7068399 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7068400 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

7068410 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7068411 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

7068611 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
7068612 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
7068613 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
7068614 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
7068615 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
7068616 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
7068617 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
7068618 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
7068619 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
7068620 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
7068621 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president

7068634 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7068635 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden

7068664 if we want to win the victory as a party weve got to stop pretending to ourselves that we shall win it by scaring people to death with our hillary masks our obama masks and our bogeyman rhetoric it has worked once or twice but i can promise you it will not work this time any more than scaring them with democrat control of congress secured our victory in 2006 no if we want their trust back and their faith back and their allegiance back then we must trust the truths upon which this country was built our allegiance to the authority of our god
7068665 it really is a little microcosm of the failing infrastructure we have throughout the country

7068697 i didnt anticipate trying to preserve sunken boats but i had the great fortune of learning from old school people about getting things done the right way
7068698 i picked it up from watching them reading books and looking at old photos
7068699 we couldnt get anybody with a future plan or vision for the tugs so we had to give them up
7068700 its more than money its support and enthusiasm and a vision i wasnt able to pull it all together
7068701 in the 1900s these were the ups trucks of the day
7068702 you could walk across the hudson on the boats waiting side by side
7068703 im running this whole project off my credit card at this point and im beginning to become discouraged
7068704 i came here because i needed a spot in a small town who might appreciate the history behind this and sign onto this idea
7068705 its great to see kids paying rapt attention to this theyd never get a chance to see this any place else
7068706 theyre attracted to boats and repair work right now im not open yet but soon ill be bringing people on board thats what im looking forward to
7068707 im maxed out financially and when i go looking for help people say this is an awesome project but then they disappear
7068708 it would only take about 6 000 to get more major work done on the tugboat but im not political i dont know how to march into city hall and ask for help with this project
7068709 ive seen projects funded for millions of dollars but they havent saved boats theyve built replicas
7068710 what trueman has is a very unique vessel for sure
7068711 there are covered barges being used on the mississippi river today carrying grain but i dont know of any railroad barges being salvaged in the country there are mainly new barges being built for these purposes

7068716 that a few friends and i are engrossed with now
7068717 reactions or way of thinking that we are often so used to having that it is much harder to correct us on what is right corrections are simply calibrations that we need fine tuning that we need to undergo not so that we can be perfect and faultless but to be able to be better

7068737 nou ga eerst maar eens zitten hoe je normaal gesproken je werk doet
7068738 mmm dat valt nog niet eens tegen je zit er aardig ontspannen bij
7068739 nee maar daar zullen we toch wel vanzelf achter komen denk ik
7068740 het is daar nogal behoorlijk druk h er staat nog een soort podium ook en daar is het ook druk ik weet haast wel zeker dat het hier is dat kan niet anders
7068741 alleen had ik waarschijnlijk niet geraden dat het hier was
7068742 jij bent zeker ook een vlieger met die krullen en die zonnebril op je kop je vliegt dan vast naar hawaii
7068743 ehm gijs we zijn nu bij de gesproken tekst hoor
7068744 en nu denken zij natuurlijk dat ze klaar zijn en naar huis kunnen
7068745 jeder d monisch attackierte umsessene oder besetzte mensch reagiert ber kurz oder lang sogar auf ferngebete von denen er nichts wei
7068746 volgens mij niet ik weet niet eens waar die brug zich bevind
7068747 pas op dat je je niet w r laat foppen door het vijvertje h
7068748 als we maaike eerst zouden ophalen is dat niet logisch
7068749 ik moet nog een 5 hebben wat is dit nee das een zes die hoef ik niet
7068750 eerst een harde knal en dan ineens stikt het van de paratroopers
7068751 ja en wij maar lachen en zwaaien naar die lui
7068752 en dan moeten we zo ook nog de tent afbreken
7068753 ja dit was er weer een bedrieglijk vriendelijk allemaal maar niet zo vervelend dat het krengig is als je geen interesse hebt is het net zo goed ok je moet het alleen even weten te herkennen
7068754 you shouldnt sleep with the boys because your older son will soon start getting boners at night
7068755 hi folks how are ya doing you must be kiddin you did not drive the whole end to vietnam
7068756 do you have a form for me to fill in for you car
7068757 in this area of life if we care about the will of god for our overall spiritual development we know his word calls us to
7068758 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that
7068759 i got comparisons coming out of my ears and she never can hit the pause if only morrissey werent so morrisseyesque she might overlook all my flaws
7068760 i cant believe that you would fall for all the crap in this song
7068761 there are many people who need this book and many sectors of society which it must penetrate in the communities of the oppressed and in the truly hellish prisons where people are force fed religion in the high schools and universities where atheist and agnostic clubs are beginning to emerge among the educated and progressive and among those hungering for enlightenment this book must reach april should be a time when this book emerges onto the scene with great impact
7068762 and how long does it take before it becomes clear that if such a god existed it would indeed be a cruel vicious sick twisted and truly monstrous god p 4
7068763 in conducting the census in the way he did david made a big mistake because soldiers on active duty were subject to a strict regimen of ritual procedures in ancient israel and were especially vulnerable therefore to cultic dangers
7068764 have the nerve to talk about the alleged horrors of communism
7068765 why do you call these right wing christian fundamentalists christian fascists
7068766 shattered faith in authority because he restored the authority of faith
7068767 upholds such things as slavery and the subjugation of women
7068768 a pparently hadnt been paying attention to the field of medicine
7068769 if somehow jesus were transported from his time to ours and we were to encounter him the fact is that we would not and we should not like this jesus very much
7068770 even most christian fundamentalists at least in the u s dont so far as i know
7068771 passing over or putting aside that which makes them uncomfortable or strikes them as wrong
7068772 but then the very basic question arises once you have in effect denied that the bible and christian religious tradition is true and valid for all times and in all circumstances then where is the divine authority for any of this
7068773 it is a legitimate and very important question which must be put to these christian fascist fundamentalists
7068774 must not be allowed to waffle and sidestep what in the bible and christian religious tradition is inconvenient for them at the time
7068775 admit that if they dont believe in every word and every part of it this cannot be the absolute word of god p 34
7068776 it is very important to understand that all this is deadly serious
7068777 these people not just the obvious lunatics out in the streets but also the more respectable types
7068778 believe they have a personal relationship with god but that they are being given a mandate
7068779 satanic forces including atheists communists and homosexuals and states that religious
7068780 as president he actively promoted religion and fundamentalist christian morality
7068781 if gods do not exist why do people believe in them
7068782 lets step back and get a broader picture from history
7068783 doesnt correspond to reality it is not borne out by what science has taught us
7068784 the notion of a god or gods was created by humanity in its infancy out of ignorance this has been perpetuated by ruling classes bringing about a new and far better world and future for humanity means overthrowing such classes
7068785 avakians away with all gods critiquing religion without understanding it
7068786 maybe there have always been big bangs followed by big collapses maybe even consciousness did precede the most recent big bang
7068787 there are many people who need this book and many sectors of society which it must penetrate in the communities of the oppressed and in the truly hellish prisons where people are force fed religion in the high schools and universities where atheist and agnostic clubs are beginning to emerge among the educated and progressive and among those hungering for enlightenment this book must reach april should be a time when this book emerges onto the scene with great impact
7068788 its apparently supposed to be a popular lively in your face exercise in agitation committed to atheism and historical materialism i myself am in principle totally sympathetic to the project
7068789 the targeted audience is vast although the book blurbs including praise from at least four professors in different fields suggest that intellectuals are one of the groups the rcp wants the book to reach in particular
7068790 people in the ghettos and barrios could use something like that book
7068791 black folks who reject the black church so throughly that they become atheist
7068792 marx by the way almost always used ideology as a pejorative and contrasted all ideology to science which is open and dynamic
7068793 over all i thought the analysis was on point but i have to say i found aspects of the tone to be unnecessary
7068794 we should have respect for the listeners intelligence and sensitivity to what might for the time being at least be deeply held beliefs
7068795 when i fed the poor they called me a saint when i asked why they were hungry they called me a communist
7068796 is there some justification for this attitude i am missing
7068797 the listeners intelligence and sensitivity to what might for the time being at least be deeply held beliefs
7068798 i have met cadre who seem very much like religious cult members and others who are anything but that
7068799 how to reconcile belief in a creator which for the record some very sophisticated people like albert einstein have held with the fact of suffering
7068800 have no different quality for me than all other people
7068801 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
7068802 no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this
7068803 for me the jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions
7068804 and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people
7068805 as far as my experience goes they are no better than other human groups although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power otherwise i cannot see anything chosen about them
7068806 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
7068807 hes fairly unequivocal as to what hes saying theres no beating about the bush
7068808 wow i didnt know all that shit was in the bible
7068809 yah but i like the nice side of charlie manson
7068810 this is the real god not the one you believe in

7068855 el alcoh lico es un enfermo como el que padece una gripe o una depresi n la persona adicta al alcohol no tiene control sobre su condici n y en su ansia por beber es insensible a los sentimientos de sus familiares para los que la vida en familia es muchas veces una pesadilla de insultos violencia e infidelidad que acaba con el matrimonio y con la armon a familiar
7068856 el 70 por ciento de los hijos de alcoh licos intentan esconder el problema porque se sienten avergonzados algo que no hace m s que agravar la situaci n porque el secreto es parte crucial del problema

7068880 i am a co sponsor of the local law enforcement enhancement act which would expand federal jurisdiction to reach violent hate crimes perpetrated because of the race color religion national origin sexual orientation gender identity or physical disability of the victim
7068881 i believe the employment non discrimination act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity i sponsored legislation in the illinois state senate that would ban discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation
7068882 ive been in these foxholes with these kids literally in bunkers with them let me tell you something nobody asked anybody else whether theyre gay in those foxholes our allies the british the french all our major allies gays openly serve i dont know the last time an american soldier said to a backup from a brit hey by the way let me check are you gay are you straight this is ridiculous
7068883 on this issue i have been at the forefront of any of the presidential candidates
7068884 i do not support gay marriage marriage has religious and social connotations and i consider marriage to be between a man and a woman
7068885 this is an issue that i think helps to describe who we are marriage connotes to so many people a religious and not just civil element and that includes me
7068886 my view is that we should try to disentangle what has historically been the issue of the word marriage which has religious connotations to some people from the civil rights that are given to couples in terms of hospital visitation in terms of whether or not they can transfer property or any of the other social security benefits and so forth
7068887 i continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage
7068888 i support the complete repeal of the defense of marriage act doma
7068889 i believe the employment non discrimination act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity
7068890 we need to do more in our schools to foster tolerance and an acceptance of diversity
7068891 assistant coaches work hard theyre knowledgeable they put in the time and they put in the extra effort

7068893 we have a numbers of guys that are becoming football players and athletes not just guys that want to wear a jersey and play at sport

7068948 theres a refinery here venezuela produces petroleum that raw material needs to be refined and we have important refineries and want to expand in the entire caribbean area and thats why were arriving at important strategic associations with sister nations
7068949 just what the dr needs a bunch of incompetent commies who botched their own productivity coming here
7068950 the growth of venezuelas gdp has been over 7 for the last 5 years a 4 gdp growth in general is considered very good
7068951 venezuela ambassador francisco belisario landis said its possible that his government would enter into a of joint management of the dominican petroleum refinery
7068952 cepal which is the organization that conduct the economy growth analysis in latin america have a warning on the numbers coming out of cuba because its government provided and can not be independently verified

7068955 shell oil corporation is owned by the dutch and is headquarted in the hague netherlands it is not an american company although it has offices worldwide
7068956 at the santo domingo refinery the dr and venezuela got to first dilute the thick dysfunctional and syrupy bourgeois managerial mentality conceived and cultivated in the corporate culture of the shell oil company out of houston
7068957 the venezuelan running dog lackey and commie boot licker who calls himself an ambassador is a pathetic excuse for a party stooge apparachik and way down the pecking order a former car washer in the streets of caracas now he comes to the dr as a puffed up stooge of the lunatic hugo
7068958 i happened to have two jazz fans in the family since you know the ambassador francisco belisario landis so well please tell him to be prudent dominican dont like other countries openly trying to influence our elected government officials get my drief slick

7068978 to address the breadth and depth that these changes to the endangered species act regulations will have on protecting our most imperiled wildlife
7068979 these regulations would reinforce the services current view that there is no requirement to consult on greenhouse gas ghg emissions contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species e g polar bears
7068980 rather than a narrow tweaking of the regulations the proposal represents a back door attack on the endangered species act
7068981 the american people deserve and expect a full public process to vet such far reaching changes to this landmark conservation law
7068982 it appears as if the administration is doing whatever it can to discourage participation in the democratic process
7068983 i think we can expect more sneaky assaults like this on our public land and wildlife laws as this administration heads for the exits
7068984 for one of our nations most important and successful environmental laws the 30 day comment period is woefully inadequate for the public to review and comment on this critical proposal
7068985 the bush administration proposal eliminates the critical checks and balances needed to protect imperiled birds and cuts species experts from the process of making decisions that need to be science based
7068986 the endangered species act is a safety net for our nations wildlife fish and plants on the brink of extinction said bill snape of the center for biological diversity
7068987 the bush administrations proposed regulations will cut a giant loophole in the safety net

7069049 theyre the world champions we got a great game against them in pool play but pool play does not win you a gold medal it just gets you into the medal round
7069050 i think our defense leads to good offense not just in turnovers but in an attack mode
7069051 i thought we didnt attack the zone in the second quarter against argentina but werent attacking defensively either youve seen us play here the whole time the real heart of our team is playing defense in the second half we attacked the zone very well and whatever but in that second quarter it showed that when we let up or just dont play well defensively it has an impact on the other end of the court

7069116 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years

7069156 weve seen two low scoring games in dambulla where it was hard to know when the time was to play your shots
7069157 because at the start it was hard to get into rhythm when the ball was doing a lot there was not enough solidarity that attitude is vital in any form of cricket stick around watch the ball and hit it in one day cricket there are field restrictions so a batsman can try his luck with the new ball but good orthodox cricket and patient shots always wins in the end
7069158 we were a bit disappointed the way we handled that situation
7069159 we knew it was going to be a tough period in that morning session and wanted to execute certain plans we couldnt and that game is gone

7069217 i just got so upset because they were basically not letting me leave

7069263 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
7069264 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
7069265 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
7069266 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7069267 even though the ratchet and clank series has stuck with the same formula for all six console games each new release has brought a tweak that has made the experience feel unique from upgradable weapons to motion controls the series has seen a sprinkling of new ideas without messing with the basic play mechanics that work so well quest for booty doesnt bring anything particularly noteworthy to the table but it does take advantage of its bite sized serving portion in one key way it focuses purely on fun whereas previous games have lost their way with too many minigames and side quests that detract from the core running and shooting action quest for booty banishes the superfluous ventures and showcases a nonstop tour of ratchets most exciting moments its strict reliance on baddie shooting bolt collecting gameplay wont convert anyone tired of those activities but people looking for a perfectly paced platformer with tight controls and impressive visuals will fall in love all over again

7069278 the administrations basic approach to foreign policy and national security i think has been bankrupted by reality the fixation on pre emption regime change and the simplistic slogans that encompass the war on terror i think literally not figuratively made us less secure made us less secure as a nation rather than more secure

7069290 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u
7069291 ending the war in iraq responsibly is in the broader strategic interests of the united states its long past time to drawdown our troop presence and to stop spending 10 billion a month in iraq so that we can increase resources for the mission in afghanistan rebuild our military and invest in our struggling economy at home

7069294 the c 17 continues to exceed our expectations in every way in performance capabilities reliability and durability
7069295 the acquisition of this strategic lift aircraft is a significant event as it provides canada with a world class and worldwide strategic airlift capability and provides our forces with an independent means to rapidly reliably and flexibly move heavy equipment over vast distances it also reduces the number of crews and stopovers required and will alleviate the workload for the aging tactical hercules fleet

7069357 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7069358 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7069359 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7069360 where obama is nuanced biden may also have a greater ability to talk tough against rivals in public debate but the senator is also known to get carried away with the sound of his own voice digressing into irrelevant personal anecdotes
7069361 he is known for verbose gaffe strewn speeches that have landed him in trouble with rival politicians
7069362 expect the gaffe radar to be hypersensitive in the general election behind the scenes republicans were calling him the undisciplined senator because sen biden is known for speaking his mind despite the fact that sen mccain is known for much of the same

7069374 lovinsky abduction was reportedly made to look like a kidnapping for ransom on tuesday 14 august the alleged abductors called family asking for a ransom of usd 300 000 however there has been no further contact from the abductors
7069375 lovinsky pierre antoine graduated in psychology from the haitian state university and obtained further specialisation on child psychology in montreal canada he has been involved for several years as a grass roots community organizer mainly working with children in the early 1990s he co founded the foundation for the support of children fondsayon kore timoun yo for young street children in port au prince and a centre for teenage mothers foyer pour m res adolescentes
7069376 i know it was a difficult decision for lovinsky because he knew the risks and he had a family that he loved but in the end lovinsky felt he could not stay out of haiti any longer that he was needed to help organize progressive grassroots voices in haiti
7069377 i last saw lovinsky in person in february 2007 at the time he was receiving threats and frequently changing where he slept he knew he was in danger but also knew that in haitis democratic transition that the traditional forces would have the upper hand he knew that if the people did not organize life would become more difficult for the majority of haitians who are poor
7069378 i have not heard of any report from any haitian authorities on lovinskys disappearance despite requests from lovinskys family fondasyon trant septanm members of the u s congress and human rights and haiti solidarity activists from around the world
7069379 we also know that the police have repeatedly failed to follow up on leads they have been provided it is hard to escape the conclusion that the haitian government is not reporting on its investigation because it is not conducting one
7069380 calling for the authorities to ensure wilson mesiliens protection in accordance with his wishes
7069381 i cannot explain why lovinsky was left out of the working groups report the un mission in haiti issued a press release about it the abduction was in the news amnesty international and other human rights groups issued action alerts the omission was especially troubling because lovinsky was such a high profile human rights activist and candidate for the senate elections
7069382 change the changeable accept the unchangeable and remove yourself from the unacceptable
7069383 still keep a number of strategically important territories under control
7069384 agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7069385 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7069386 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7069387 i worked hard thats all i can say i worked hard to get here it wasnt easy at all it may look easy but it was hard
7069388 therefore all the records that have been broken by usain bolt and all the gold medals that have been won by other jamaicans have come after extensive testing
7069389 that as far as i am concerned is more than adequate proof
7069390 what i think almost amuses us is why some people in the world dont feel that others can be that good we have been good for a very long time
7069391 we have some marvelous talent here and wouldnt want anybody to suggest at all that this is not pure raw talent that has been properly trained and properly coached and properly presented and reaping the rewards of all that hard work
7069392 i wont change that and i dont see any problem with it because people enjoy watching me
7069393 ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top
7069394 because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can
7069395 i am so happy to have achieved this performance this year it was very special for me to win double at the olympics its fantastic
7069396 the 5 000 is very difficult because i came from the 10 000 days earlier
7069397 for now im just going to go back to kenya and celebrate before i have to start thinking about if i will keep running when i look back at where i was in 2001 i never expected to still be running
7069398 i would have preferred hillary and im disappointed she is not on the ticket
7069399 would have really been the dream ticket so many have talked about the best ticket
7069400 not to see them working together i dont know what it was maybe he just couldnt see himself working closely with former president bill clinton or he couldnt work with her but at the very least there should have been a conversation about the perimeters
7069401 apparently could never come to terms with that possibility but biden is a good appointment he brings experience we need with obamas change he can certainly work well with congress and now we move on
7069402 as a woman i shared the hope that when we came so close to nominating a woman for president and now we wont have a woman on the ticket at all well it is disappointing
7069403 i dont think he obama was ever seriously thinking about her i dont think it was in the cards from the beginning
7069404 i think hes a great choice he will complement obama well of course he has foreign relations experience as a roman catholic he may bring in some former clinton supporters to the ticket
7069405 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7069406 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7069407 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7069408 thats one of the things i hate about this sport

7069412 nuclear weapon proliferation is the single most immediate threat hanging over the world today
7069413 turned its hand to new bunker busting nuclear weapons designed to attack underground facilities
7069414 the plain fact is there can be no non proliferation without de proliferation
7069415 that is if the weapons states are not prepared to rid themselves of nuclear weapons why would other states continue to deny themselves the kind of leverage which these weapons bring
7069416 the old order of victorious powers with major powers hanging onto weapons of massive destruction is a remnant of the violent 20th century
7069417 it cannot provide the basis for an equitable and effective system of world governance
7069418 just as world community concerns have been ahead of the political system on issues such as global warming so too world community concern needs to galvanise international action to find a new template for a lasting peace one embracing all the major powers and regions

7069429 brown looks like a banana and every student likes it
7069430 hes stared down dictators all around the world he has decades of experience in washington and yet uniquely he is not of washington he goes home to his family in delaware every single night he is rooted in the middle class he has been the voice for cops and firefighters all around the world he is the perfect person you could try to find to get away from the failed policies of the bush administration he is an independent thinker joe biden as you well know has never been at a loss for words
7069431 we have somebody who hasnt forgotten where he comes from and goes home to delaware every night on the train and has a record of working across party lines to get things done not just in foreign affairs but somebody who has worked to strengthen our crime laws prevent violence against women and work with senator obama to help update fuel efficiency standards in the congress
7069432 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7069433 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7069434 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7069435 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7069436 in the end there must be a purpose to our journey human endeavor cannot consist simply of random acts and happenstance there needs to be meaning beyond self that gives our limited days definition and direction and only within that meaning can the judgment rendered upon our lives have worth

7069439 i shouldnt have started this controversy in the first place and i apologize to the whole world for it
7069440 however mr nalty will still be credited on this blog and he is welcome to post at any time regardless of the fact if he doesnt read it anyway

7069456 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7069457 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown

7069462 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7069463 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice

7069486 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7069487 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees

7069548 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7069549 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice

7069576 it is 30 years since the last major office building in ipswich and the scheme will fulfil a need for new grade a office space in the town centre
7069577 the town has got a tremendously strong and broad economic base and lots of different sectors within the ipswich economy have been expanding over the last two or three years particularly the service sector but there have been no new buildings to accommodate their expansion
7069578 ipswich needs some more new space and we think theres enough demand for it if it can be provided
7069579 here we have an opportunity for office occupiers to ensure their needs are incorporated into the design process rather than work around the constraints of an existing building
7069580 it also helps that the developer has such an established track record of delivering high quality office schemes in ipswich
7069581 ipswich really needs high quality office space these types of development are to be welcomed

7069605 outside the matrix everything is possible and there are no limits
7069606 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7069607 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7069608 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7069609 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7069610 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7069611 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7069612 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7069613 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis

7069641 financial entities like banks broker dealers regional banks finance companies and insurance companies need credit at reasonable rates in order to finance themselves
7069642 for many regional banks like keycorp zions regions and national city the door has already shut on them if they wanted to raise capital in the debt market at levels where their outstanding issues regularly trade they would have to pay 12 15 hardly economic levels

7069655 i dont know those things they came out of nowhere they went nuts and just started killing everything i dont know
7069656 i said what could they possibly do they cant arrest me for this i was wrong
7069657 none of this would have been necessary if she followed the agreement and returned the books
7069658 i completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and not going to my court date

7069661 theres no doubt that some people are going to view this as she is not being accorded respect

7069667 angesichts der umfangreichen vorbereitung auf diese neue strecke ist es sehr entt uschend kein auto unter die top 10 gebracht zu haben
7069668 ich bin sicher dass wir das potenzial dazu hatten aber potenzial ist eben kein ergebnis
7069669 es ist klar dass ich nach diesem qualifying entt uscht bin denn ich hatte ganz andere vorstellungen
7069670 jetzt steht uns ein schwierigeres rennen bevor aber auf einem stra enkurs kann alles passieren
7069671 wir m ssen weiter hart arbeiten und uns eine strategie berlegen mit der wir morgen auf alle eventualit ten vorbereitet sind
7069672 mein erster run in q3 war sehr gut und auf dem zweiten habe ich im ersten sektor eine verbesserung geschafft dort kam die pole her
7069673 es war nichts schlimmes aber auf dieser strecke ist ein kleiner fehler sehr teuer ich denke ich kann immer noch um den sieg mitk mpfen vor allem wenn ich einen guten start schaffe wir haben ein gutes auto das im rennen stark sein sollte
7069674 das ist aber nichts neues die qualifyings waren dieses jahr nicht leicht f r mich ich bin also nicht berrascht dass es nicht so gelaufen ist wir haben die situation verbessert aber es ist noch nicht so wie wir das wollen wir werden versuchen es n chstes mal besser zu machen
7069675 es w re besser gewesen wenn es anders herum geblieben w re nat rlich ist es f r den pole fahrer fairer wenn er auf der sauberen seite steht aber hier ist es auf keiner seite sauber da wir zwischen den startpl tzen durchfahren

7069705 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
7069706 no nation under god invisable with gibberish and just us alone
7069707 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope well be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
7069708 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race
7069709 today we saw another very good afternoons work from both lewis and heikki characterised by strong lap times that reflect their respective race strategies all in all therefore were well prepared for the first grand prix to be held on this exciting new racetrack all the drivers did an exemplary job today in fact avoiding the walls in the tricky conditions we hope that tomorrows race will be equally incident free and that in time the valencia event will become a regular integral and much admired element of the formula 1 calendar i would like to offer our congratulations to all concerned and to the valencia authorities in particular with appropriate promotion this grand prix promises to become a fabulous adjunct to our sports existing harbourside spectacular namely
7069710 a very exciting qualifying session here on this completely new and impressive circuit

7069830 i am not thinking of next year now and will not until the end of the season
7069831 he certainly loves moonee valley and he seems to be getting better and better
7069832 he hasnt got a lot left to prove at 1000m i think he has to have a crack at a group 1 race like that
7069833 its a big question mark whether he would run out the trip out especially a high pressure manikato but it is worth having a try
7069834 if he gets away with a nice run even outside the leader he may be a chance because he goes so well at this track you certainly couldnt discard him
7069835 my biggest worry today was that they would pressure him
7069836 hes an aggressive going horse when something sits up outside him
7069837 but they left him alone and i got rolling about 500m out in a bid to try to get a few off the bridle on this track
7069838 he scooted well although he didnt really handle the track well it was probably his easiest win given the lack of pressure on him early
7069839 hes been carrying big weights and hes not a big horse but hes very wide and strong
7069840 hes just a gun horse with a great nature that will make a lovely stallion
7069841 hes a high quality player hes great at keeping possession hes got great vision and hes training really well
7069842 mark gasniers situation illustrates that sponsors tend to look for an association with a club the league or our broadcasters before they look for involvement with an individual player
7069843 obviously we are happy to talk to the storm about third party sponsors for greg but we wont be breaking or bending the rules for any one player
7069844 the situation is that ok he hasnt got a great track record thats quite obvious
7069845 however hes still quite young and we think hes got something to offer
7069846 trainers wont be signing this document and we wont be taking our horses back to randwick under these demands
7069847 the last time andrew flintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005
7069848 he relaxed lovely and it was a good patient ride and he joined in at the last 100m
7069849 today was only the start weve got a long campaign ahead the guineas and derby its a good way to start
7069850 hes the biggest eater youve ever seen youve got to keep the work up to him
7069851 we didnt plan to have him last but he stepped a bit slow and then he made a real good run at them like he was going to win but he knocked up he hadnt trialled hell come on a lot
7069852 she races a lot better than she works and they sneak up on you a bit when they do that
