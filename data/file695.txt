6950000 this is a great way to get our community involved in what we are doing
6950001 its always a lot of fun to gather with friends of the program as well as keep them informed on the performance of our guys in a very relaxed atmosphere not everyone can come out to the practice field to make their own judgment of the team so this is a way to hopefully get more people involved
6950002 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
6950003 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on life i dont want to see the latter

6950024 das ist nat rlich nicht befriedigend nur ein punkt aus zwei spielen keine frage
6950025 wir waren zu statisch in der 2 halbzeit das 0 0 ist ein ergebnis was f r uns nicht zufriedenstellend ist

6950030 i dont know where the four minutes of stoppage time came from and then he stopped time for the last minute
6950031 weve picked up a point it should have been three theres no denying that fact and i think newcastle found themselves very lucky today
6950032 realistically after the first half the game should have been dead and buried we should have capitalised on our opportunities and been more ruthless in front of goal van egmond said
6950033 but it tends to be a situation that when you are not ruthless in front of goal and you dont go on with it you invite the other team back in and thats exactly what we did
6950034 we just need to have a bit more of an awareness he said
6950035 i thought both fullbacks were probably the poorest theyve been and we rely heavily on the fullbacks getting involved in the play and also working hard on the defensive side of things

6950078 so what the money came from millionaires who didnt need it as badly as the people to whom i gave it and i didnt use any of it for myself
6950079 you are nothing but a thief your actions deserve condemnation and even punishment not praise or commendation that money belonged to those millionaires not to you and not to the people to whom you gave it you could have asked the millionaires to donate their money to the poor but you had no moral or legal right to steal it from them despite what you did with the money
6950080 what a caring and compassionate person i am how fortunate that i belong to a society where my government taxes the rich and gives to the poor we are all good people politicians bureaucrats and citizens alike

6950084 my fellow americans i have made a grave and grievous error i secured your support for the invasion of iraq on the basis of my claim that saddam was threatening our nation with wmds it turns out that saddam was telling the truth that he really had destroyed his wmds i hereby apologize to you and the iraqi people who have already lost loved ones in this invasion i am hereby ordering the withdrawal of all u s troops from iraq i am very sorry for my mistake

6950103 they were given just 20 rs 1 600 to cover their meals and my daughter was forced to crawl about on a filthy uncarpeted floor needless to say she caught a stomach bug when she came back and the doctor said that it had probably been brought on by the unhygienic conditions

6950106 there is an increase in commuters north of borivli but the number of trains are the same the first preference should be given to virar locals but due to some conspiracy this has not been done
6950107 the board is being unfair we have requested them to give us our share of trains from the 12 new rakes that have already come and seven that are expected shortly
6950108 commuters on wr are increasing but the board is least bothered most of the new rakes are being allotted to the cr why this discrimination
6950109 like all great writers of fiction ursula k le guin creates imaginary worlds that restore us hearts eased to our own
6950110 she wields her pen with a moral and psychological sophistication rarely seen and while science fiction techniques often buttress her stories they rarely take them over what she really does is write fables splendidly intricate and hugely imaginative tales about such mundane concerns as life death love and sex
6950111 idiosyncratic and convincing le guins characters have a long afterlife
6950112 her worlds are haunting psychological visions molded with firm artistry
6950113 if you want excess and risk and intelligence try le guin
6950114 her characters are complex and haunting and her writing is remarkable for its sinewy grace

6950120 sometimes we are restricted by the fact that robbers commit crimes on running trains and run away in the dark after stopping trains between stations this happens especially in deserted areas these goggles will enable us to track them in such cases the goggles will help our personnel tackle criminals even in railway yards and other areas that are not lit in the night

6950123 i have received a letter from tata motors managing director ravi kant explaining that they need a total 997 11 acre for the project at one place
6950124 we dont believe in blackmailing politics the state government may give in to this kind of statement our main concern is the welfare of the villagers
6950125 the state government is only concerned about millionaires like ratan tata chief minister buddadeb bhattacharjee is least worried about providing protection to the villagers
6950126 we support all agitations directly concerned with farmers and amarnath pilgrims anywhere in the country

6950133 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6950134 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6950135 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers
6950136 speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music
6950137 were not going to turn on a switch one day and suddenly our audience gets 100 times bigger

6950144 however the incorporation of citygml read write support into fme is perhaps the single most important next step towards broad adoption of 3d city models in the geospatial industry i look forward to the rapid adoption of this platform which is designed to support next generation 3d solutions
6950145 we are committed to supporting ogc standards and encouraging data interoperability in the various segments of the spatial data world including 3d
6950146 this in mind extending our support for the newest ogc specification citygml was a natural choice we look forward to seeing the power of data interoperability that citygml holds unfold in projects around the globe

6950193 look there is simply no other way to say it but to speak the absolute brutal truth here general petraeus has shockingly abrogated and noxiously defiled the sacred oath he took to protect and preserve support and defend not a parochial biblical worldview of the new testaments gospel of jesus christ but the united states constitution which includes a specific beacon provision which boldly proclaims absolutely no religious test in clause 3 article 6 by so very prominently and universally endorsing chaplain mccoys book with its unadulterated promotion of christian religious supremacy and concomitant excoriating and denigrating of the veracity integrity and character of the hundreds of thousands of united states military personnel who freely elect to follow no religious path petraeus unlawfully fashions his own de facto religion test in direct contravention of americas most cherished and beloved governing document his command leadership role thus has become terminally freighted and compromised with this disgusting vile unconstitutional christian religious tyranny and exceptionalism at precisely the same time we are at war with islamic fundamentalists framing americas iraq and afghanistan combat efforts as a modern day crusade the monumentally detrimental national security risks attendant to petraeuss actions of constitutional defiance justify the swift forfeiture of his titular position of military command and further cry out for his immediate punishment by general courts martial under article 134

6950202 we are very close in terms of time to the four cars right in front of us the car just needs to be fine tuned a bit and then well be right up there we have a tendency to race a lot better than we qualify now the team will go to work theyll make some changes before the race tomorrow and well be good
6950203 we would have liked to have bragged a little more but were in the third row which is a fairly good position to start we always race better than we qualify so i think were in good position for the race
6950204 but we have a car that runs consistent lap times over and over strategy is also really important here everyone who has won a race here has won it based on having great pit stops so well have to do the same
6950205 a fifth place qualifying effort isnt totally unexpected in the context of this weekend although it is definitely not what we anticipated coming into here this has historically been a good track for us but we will keep working at it were fortunate to have a half hour practice before the race tomorrow and we will try a couple of more things

6950220 i was at a point in my life where things that i had really struggled with a lot to overcome when i was fifteen years old
6950221 i went up to a mountain every morning at 5am to meet my sifu chinese calling for teacher he taught me chinese literature and chinese calligraphy for over two years
6950222 at that time i was so passionate with what i do
6950223 maybe too passionate i had no time for my family my wife left me at last
6950224 i suppose what really consumed my thoughts was the idea of trying to accept what has happened in the past i think there are resentments but there is also wanting to have hope and realizing that you cant control everything at the same time
6950225 his passion in work his attitude in life his interests in chinese literature and culture made me respect him more and more each day

6950231 the club idea is not to make me rich or to make the other people poor
6950232 if i choose to smoke this is not illegal immoral or fattening and its within the law as a club
6950233 if it hadnt been for those exports we may have remained a wilderness and a colony for many years
6950234 with the economy as it is people are staying home more and traveling less
6950235 and with the price of gasoline people are looking for other things to do so business has actually increased since the gas went up
6950236 the taxation of cigarettes of alcohol is exorbitant not only on a state but on a federal level
6950237 the sin tax as its called is levied only on those people that choose to use but it pays for the good of everyone
6950238 invitations were out the program was set it was too far down the line to include michael
6950239 it becomes a catch 22 when you miss the first debate people assume youre not interested
6950240 they are all friends of ryans and craig pitts father and i have had the opportunity to meet them and their families
6950241 it is becoming very clear why post traumatic stress disorder alcohol abuse and drug overdoses are prevalent

6950271 the big mistake from bush was that after 9 11 he thought he had a mission
6950272 bush is rigid and boring and is surrounded by people who are boring and rigid
6950273 well you deserve where you are now dont uprise against me and maybe next lifetime youll be doing as good as me
6950274 this pentacle is fit for exciting earthquakes seeing that the power of each order of angels herein invoked is sufficient to make the whole universe tremble

6950277 this is the covenant i will make with the house of israel after that time
6950278 i will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts i will be their god and they will be my people 34 no longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying know the lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest
6950279 and with a burning pain in my heart i realized how needless and petty and disceptive were all those things that ketp us from loving one another i came to realize that when you are in love that in all your judgments about love that you should start from something higher and more important than happiness and unhappiness verture and sin and all their expected meanings or you should make no judgments at all
6950280 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
6950281 dont settle for being an option rather than a priority
6950282 and the sky was made of amethyst and all the stars look just like little fish you should learn when to go you should learn how to say no
6950283 from a community point of view theyre not just getting the standard graphs where you see temperature going up or the global average which doesnt really mean a lot to a lot of people
6950284 theyll be able to find out as a community what the implications of climate change will be on them and how it might increase the flood risk but then we want to see how they can adapt to that and make changes to the river
6950285 ghaffur is very unhappy because the met is briefing against him
6950286 details of the claim will not be available to anyone until next week
6950287 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
6950288 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6950289 we will have to see what other issues were present
6950290 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6950291 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6950292 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometres away i want to be with them
6950293 they really want to go home so they can get on with their lives
6950294 that is the way they will best deal with this situation
6950295 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6950296 to me theres a lot of politics being played and a lot of people trying to put people in bad positions in order to further their agendas
6950297 when you have people dying because theyre poor and black or poor and white or because of whatever they are if thats a number on a political scale then that is the most wrong thing that erases everything thats great about our country
6950298 theres no reason why someone cant go down there whos supposed to be the leader of the free world and say im giving you a job to do and im not leaving here until its done and youre held accountable and youre held accountable and youre held accountable
6950299 this is what ive given you to do and if its not done by the time i get back on my plane then youre fired and someone else will be in your place
6950300 i fear for our country if we cant handle our people during a natural disaster and i cant stand to see it it doesnt take a brain surgeon to figure out point a to point b and they cant even skip from point a to point b
6950301 i want to run for the senate from tennessee not now but when im 50 when the music dies down
6950302 at least we can justly claim that back home we have no choice but to toe the party line what excuse have the americans got
6950303 the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the 26 member states affirmed the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity a diplomatic formula rejecting demands supported by moscow for independence for the contested breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia

6950307 if the guys in the kiosk he has to run across the yard to shut it down if theres an accident
6950308 he wont make it in time ill guarantee you that propane explodes very fast
6950309 i could see all their propane tanks piling up piling up
6950310 it was a mess it was dirty im angry im furious im frustrated
6950311 everybody complained saying why are they putting this station here we complained to city hall mps politicians nobody listened to us and we were all like somethings going to happen and eventually it happened
6950312 those who have a close connection to what is being supervised and perhaps have a vested interest are those who are now doing the supervising
6950313 the judgement itself im sure speaks volumes on the ethics for sunrise
6950314 part of the plan to safeguard the paper confronted with difficulties which threaten its very existence lhumanit will not appear this friday and saturday
6950315 to get the newspaper out of the financial impasse in which it has been placed due to the non realisation of the sale of its building in mid july
6950316 dont allow lhumanit to be weakened or gagged at the moment when our fellow citizens more than ever need plural sources of information
6950317 we want this forum to lead to means which will defend the plurality of the press defend the daily press and create the conditions so they can exist and for a new reflection on aid for the press
6950318 neither the president nor the ministry of culture nor the main media have taken a position once again lhumanit is dying amid general indifference besides the mobilization of lhumanit s readers it is total radio silence from official intellectuals and ideologues who are trying to reinforce the big multimedia press empires allied with those in power
6950319 since 1997 in spite of important work with a useful contribution from the communists in the plural majority government men and women have remarked that in fact the policy of the government is not transforming their daily lives
6950320 do unto others as you would have them do unto you as if you were them
6950321 its the closest thing to hell ive seen the corpses were boiling everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
6950322 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared from view in a hollow past the end of the runway
6950323 the plane left the gate for take off at 1 20 pm but then the pilot apologised and said he would have to return because of a technical problem
6950324 an hour later we went to take off i heard a horrible noise and the next thing i remember was being flung from the aircraft i must have passed out but woke when there was a loud explosion
6950325 i could hardly move but lifted my head and saw other bodies around me there was incredible heat and i heard people and children crying for help i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
6950326 such engine fires are extremely rare but when they do occur they are invariably the result of some form of mechanical failure
6950327 the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away
6950328 the organised chaos in which the company exists cant continue
6950329 the lack of resources and their quality on the ground the repeated aogs grounded planes in the fleet the scarcity of crews and the system of movement of crew members mean that the general feeling is one of operational chaos that places the passengers at risk
6950330 the operation continues to be a disaster and is getting worse by the day
6950331 the md fleet has not been renewed in favour of a320s in the agreed timeframe
6950332 my victory has proved that athletes with a yellow skin can run as fast as those with black and white skins
6950333 perhaps a nation of 1 3 billion should not place the burden of its aspirations on a boys shoulder
6950334 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon the competition due to injury and we hope he will cast aside the mental burden and settle his mind to overcoming his injury
6950335 lift your fighting spirit and seek to win greater honour for the motherland
6950336 even as they sip cappuccino at starbucks or show off their new buicks made by gm the last thing most want is to make over their homeland in the wests image theyre after something far more ambitious a china that lives up to their sense of national greatness
6950337 members of this class grumble about corruption but on the whole they have fared quite well from chinas economic boom of the past decade they know that if democracy were introduced tomorrow they would be outvoted and they have little interest in changing the system
6950338 not standing is no crime one who thinks differently is not a criminal
6950339 im doing the same work as a secondary school teacher but im being paid 13 000 less to do it
6950340 the major towns of the agency like khar raghagan hajilawant jar and others were completely deserted no sign of life was seen there some of the houses and a religious seminary near jar village had been dashed to the ground after being hit by missiles fired from gunship helicopters or jet fighters that were used in the operation
6950341 they the military are not hitting the known targets of the militants but blitzing the civilian abodes
6950342 around 30 people were killed in our village during the operation which forced us to leave the town
6950343 i am in a miserable condition here in the camp but i cannot return to our home due to continued shelling which has already wounded my daughter and destroyed our house
6950344 we arrived here this morning as our village nawagai was heavily shelled by gunship helicopters
6950345 pitiable as they did not have the required facilities including power potable water toilets etc
6950346 the internally displaced people of bajaur said the troops did not target the militant centres which are located at stone throws distance from their bases
6950347 rather the helicopters and artillery target the civilian population resulting in mounting civilian casualties
6950348 no one can deny the fact that pakistan and afghanistan are the gateway to the rich oil and gas reserves of the central asian republics
6950349 the war on terror was started to gain control of these reserves
6950350 if it the offensive in the fata doesnt stop we will continue such attacks the wah factory is a killer factory where arms are being produced to kill our women and children
6950351 the pro us policies pursued by the musharraf led regime
6950352 my son was not the kind of kid who had conflict with the police shields said
6950353 family members said they did not think that shields even had a weapon that morning
6950354 interest on savings bank accounts should be credited on a regular basis whether the account is operative or not if a fixed deposit receipt matures and proceeds are unpaid the amount left unclaimed with the bank will attract savings bank rate of interest
6950355 the solar business will see significant investment however we would not like to disclose the overall size of the investment at this point
6950356 we are considering sites in three states which includes madhya pradesh chhattisgarh and orissa to establish a manufacturing site for solar modules
6950357 with star jolsha as well we plan to create a revolution in the bengali entertainment similar to what we have been able to achieve with our other leading brands viewers can look forward to a standard of bengali entertainment thats on par with the finest in the country bar none
6950358 its one we can hopefully build off if we eliminate our mistakes
6950359 i cant think of anything better than being out here
6950360 n o zoei muito com os jogadores apenas perguntei pra eles se o brasil tinha esquecido o seu bom futebol ou ficaram com medo do meu primo me perdoe os brasileiros mas ver a argentina ganhar do brasil legal
6950361 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
6950362 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and on the league he never intended for this to be the case
6950363 he has said to me if you need me to resign as a director to serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that as long as it doesnt change anything else
6950364 were talking about a lot of things weve talked about restructuring the board and selling part of his stake to an equity partner who could come in and take some of the pressure away
6950365 with fan and fred on the brink of a treasury bailout crucial support to the mortgage market will be sorely tested
6950366 the ensnared banks in turn are asking larger players in the market to redeem their long term borrowings which could trigger further sales of asset backed securities this means credit is about to get even costlier and tighter
6950367 healing in the housing market might still be a few quarters away time that fannie and freddie and possibly several others in the financial industry probably dont have
6950368 definitely off from what the production hoped its hard to know what exactly is to blame
6950369 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6950370 that information is totally false there is a healthy advance for the show and there is no chance of the run being shortened
6950371 this is an agreement that of course will establish a missile defense site here in poland a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threat to the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6950372 just because youre not tired of being lied to heres condoleezza rice
6950373 this is an agreement that of course will establish a missile defense site here in poland a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threat to the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea

6950375 the people in this stadium need to know who were going to fight for
6950376 the reason that im running for president is because of you not because of folks who are writing big checks and thats a clear message that has to be sent i think by every candidate
6950377 some people were moving around and i didnt quite get all of his answer
6950378 the honest answer to that is i dont but i think it is absolutely wrong as president of the united states for me to have used that faith basis as a basis for denying anybody their rights and i will not do that when im president of the united states
6950379 how do you address the issue of sex race in your campaign
6950380 partisanship plays a major role as to why nothing can get done in washington today
6950381 i hope you know you are going to die i just stabbed you in the head

6950386 it was promised that there would be no overpass because it would increase truck traffic through the southern part of town which is residential areas

6950388 it will help some but i dont think its slowed anybody down this place is packed
6950389 sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself can he then be trusted with the government of others or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him let history answer this question
6950390 barack obamas failure to accurately report his campaigns financial records is an incredibly suspicious situation that appears to be an attempt to hide his campaigns interaction with a left wing organization previously convicted of voter fraud for a candidate who claims to be practicing new politics his fec reports look an awful lot like the old style chicago politics of yesterday
6950391 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6950392 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6950393 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6950394 tell me who your friends are and ill tell you who you are
6950395 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me

6950430 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6950431 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6950432 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6950433 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6950434 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
6950435 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
6950436 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves

6950439 its very frustrating to have to sit here and fight with the states attorneys office who is supposed to be protecting you and then fight with the police department who is also there to protect you
6950440 if youve got the guy taped drinking isnt that the best evidence of all

6950442 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6950443 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector

6950445 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6950446 the only way to get somebody who agrees with you 100 percent is to run yourself and i have no interest in that

6950452 he cometido el peor de los pecados confiar en los espejos
6950453 roy is a dominant pitcher he proved it again tonight
6950454 thats the name of the game you have to get clutch hits when you have guys with an opportunity to score weve been kind of scratching these last few days trying to come up with base hits in key situations and havent been able to do it
6950455 they got a ground ball through the infield in the first inning and then reyes moved to second on a pitch in the dirt they bunted him over to third and got that bleeder over the infield to score him after being down 1 0 there youve got to kind of shut it down there
6950456 i thought i threw a pretty good pitch to schneider
6950457 i think he just cheated guessing on a first pitch heater and went out there and got it it was a pretty good pitch as far as location i was trying to get a first pitch strike down and away i threw it down and away but he was able to hook it to right field
6950458 other than that home run i thought roy was terrific just as well as he threw last time out when he allowed one hit in eight scoreless innings against arizona
6950459 in a normal situation youre going to end up with some runs when youre facing santana its a little tough to scratch anything off him we had him a couple times there we just couldnt get the hit when we needed it
6950460 i aint doing nothing special im just one of the only people thatll speak up
6950461 por que si queremos cambiar las cosas tenemos que empezar por nosotros
6950462 ya en ese momento lugo ten a claro que hab a que adecuar la doctrina a la realidad latinoamericana desde siempre estuvo comprometido con la teolog a de la liberaci n y lo demostr con su trabajo en las regiones m s pobres y en su experiencia con los abor genes guaran es
6950463 con una propuesta valiente de cambio combatir el hambre impulsar la agricultura familiar impulsar la inclusi n
6950464 porque es una manera de ver el poder por eso l debe desmantelarla y su base no ser el parlamento porque all es d bil su base ser popular all radica su fortaleza
6950465 los pueblos abor genes tienen sus propias agendas y las est n articulando con otros sectores
6950466 el cristianismo no siga destruyendo las creencias ind genas sino que debemos seguir aprendiendo y apoyando su cosmovisi n
6950467 la l gica que explota al hombre es igual a la que explota a la naturaleza e hizo hincapi en que el mandato b blico de dios no fue que el hombre dominara la tierra y sus seres sino el de
6950468 el ser humano es creado y creador dios entreg la tierra a los seres humanos como herencia para que la cuiden no para que sean dominadores
6950469 debemos aceptar la alteridad esto es el derecho del otro a estar aqu con nosotros
6950470 cu l es la novedad matiz la iglesia no estuvo siempre caritativamente atenta al sufrimiento de los pobres la diferencia capital es que el cristianismo de la liberaci n ya no considera a los pobres como simples objetos de ayuda compasi n o caridad sino como protagonistas de su propia historia art fices de su propia liberaci n
6950471 entre los pobres est el gran pobre que es el planeta tierra explotado saqueado por la voracidad del proceso industrial moderno enfatiza todos vivimos bajo un modelo de civilizaci n que explota a las personas las clases las naciones y agota los escasos recursos de la tierra por eso necesitamos una ecolog a de la liberaci n unir ecolog a f sica cu ntica discurso teol gico y espiritualidad
6950472 no s lo los pobres gritan las aguas gritan los animales gritan el planeta entero grita
6950473 que es la marca registrada de la teolog a de la liberaci n
6950474 el gran pobre que es la tierra y sus ecosistemas
6950475 por eso hablamos de una eco teolog a de la liberaci n
6950476 la visi n que los astronautas nos dan de la tierra ellos cuando ven la tierra desde afuera dicen que no hay distinci n entre la humanidad y la tierra que todo es una misma unidad el ser humano es la propia tierra que en un momento de su evoluci n empez a sentir a pensar a amar nosotros somos tierra no estamos sobre el planeta tierra somos la propia tierra que piensa que ama basta de hablar de medio ambiente hay que hablar de ambiente entero
6950477 hay una nueva conciencia del orgullo de ser se est n organizando son los primeros due os de la tierra y reclaman sus derechos imponen agendas
6950478 es que la mayor a de los medios de comunicaci n son empresas que quieren ganancias
6950479 claro que hay otros medios como las radios comunitarias la tv p blica o internet que rompen las hegemon as de los grandes medios
6950480 estamos ante una traves a desde un tipo de sociedad industrial enfrentada con la naturaleza hacia otra de inclusi n que priorice la l gica de la vida
6950481 como un proceso nico y contradictorio con caos y cosmos que a medida que se expande se vuelve m s complejo y cuanto m s complejo m s cargado de conciencia hasta llegar a la conciencia del ser humano y a la vida como autorganizaci n de la materia
6950482 debemos librarnos de una teolog a c nica a la que no le interesan los temas de la gente y abrazar la teolog a de la calle la teolog a viviente
6950483 siempre hubo pobreza pero ahora es escandalosa y visible no pueden ocultarla es subhumana

6950489 the red kelpie dog named ruby is lost up there somewhere so if anyone does come across it family hopefully will go up there later today and try and locate the dog and call its name and a happy ending hopefully will be had by all
6950490 the kelpie dog is probably what saved his life and if he didnt have the dog with him certainly the outcome could have been substantially more serious in fact who knows how serious the weather up there was well below zero
6950491 poor is the man whose pleasure depends on the permission of another
6950492 if sixth graders in america took finance i could say to you that as every sixth grader knows diversification mitigates risk and this policy is substantially more diversified and that is why it has a lower standard deviation

6950508 it is not good that man be alone i will make him a helper fit for him
6950509 abortions have not gone down in the united states during the presidency of george w bush a strong abortion opponent
6950510 i believe in roe vs wade and i come to that conclusion not because im proabortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members
6950511 and so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way ive now inserted this into the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions the fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address
6950512 theres no way to spin this one the abortion rate is at its lowest rate since 1974

6950517 it didnt really look like fernando wanted to be out there i dont think thats any secret
6950518 theyre kind of going for broke and they dont have much to lose they kind of have an excuse that was tough
6950519 at the beginning he played really good and i played horrible
6950520 in the second i played better and he started to miss much more and in the third set he served really good and i didnt have too many chances to break him
6950521 i need to forget about this match about all the mistakes i made and try to see everything positively for the open
6950522 hopefully the champions league will take me on to the next stage
6950523 to win a competition like that is a great achievement for any player we are all in the game to win trophies i am no different
6950524 when i have finished i will look back and see how many trophies i have won and judge myself then
6950525 we have a lot of young players in the team and it can only help us
6950526 hopefully we can take that in to the next few years and make us a better team
6950527 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6950528 i dont just judge my performance on goals i look at assists and how i have helped the team play that is the way my game is
6950529 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a footballer
6950530 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
6950531 when dud they leave and where did they go leopard hunting
6950532 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6950533 most of them have generators built into their home and they still store some of our vaccines that are on ice and some of the animals because they do not evacuate they stay
6950534 get your pet up to date on its vaccinations if you need any calming meds talk to your vet start researching on the internet pet friendly hotels
6950535 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6950536 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6950537 they try and preach it to whoever comes in here
6950538 you dont play if you dont think youre going to win
6950539 we think were going to win every time out no matter who we face no matter who were playing individually and as a team so i dont think any of us are surprised that were here because were playing how we expect to play obviously it doesnt work out like that every year but if we actually play up to our own expectations you should be successful right now were playing well as a team and different guys are stepping up every night to get us wins
6950540 thats only going to help them for the future regardless of how the season plays out
6950541 theyre very quick to lift us up and tell us when we did well in our outings
6950542 very seldom do they air us out and make us feel like were not doing what they want us to do
6950543 but you cant be foolishly optimistic and put all your eggs in one basket
6950544 we knew we had enough pieces of the puzzle here with mauer morneau and nathan
6950545 it is a real buzz to get back there and actually drive the track
6950546 i had some fans with me to watch the first nationwide race this year and they got debris in their beer cans
6950547 thats all they could talk about was how they were sitting so close that they got debris in their beer cans bristol is a great place its one of the best tracks we go to because of the atmosphere
6950548 people ask me all the time which racetrack is my favorite and before they can even get the question out i tell them its bristol
6950549 bristol is racing heaven a super fast short track with unbelievable banking and its only gotten better since they repaved it after the spring race in 2007
6950550 now you can race high and low and it opens up the track for more passing and better racing the two races at bristol are by far my favorite of the year daytona is daytona and indy is indy they are historic pressure packed and prestigious but bristol is just awesome bristol is fun fast paced challenging edge of your seat racing everything i love about racing
6950551 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else
6950552 you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
6950553 races at bristol are always crazy but they seem to get a little wilder when were racing at night
6950554 i dont know why the night races seem to have more wrecks maybe its because the fans are so hyped up by the time the race starts the drivers just feed off of their excitement
6950555 i think we are close i think we are competitive
6950556 we still need a little bit more speed to be in our comfort zone of what we want but we have made a lot of progress over the summer we just get into those final 10 races and see what happens
6950557 carl has shown a lot of strength i think we have over the last few weeks as well kyle has been rock solid all year so you know those three are the obvious ones
6950558 but when you get into the chase and that points margin closes up there are going to be some other guys we will need to think about and worry about as well we are just going to keep doing our jobs and give 100 percent and hopefully get the job done
6950559 in all of the years that i have been racing i have never taken anything to my car like a good luck charm
6950560 but at michigan a nice lady working in the napa suite handed me a furry monkey she told me that i had a monkey on my back and she wanted me to put the monkey in my car so i could get the monkey off my back
6950561 i carried it with me and i think we got it done he just rolled around in my car and behaved we ended up finishing in the top 20 we had a solid run all i wanted to do was compete and be competitive we accomplished that on sunday
6950562 i would say he picks up 99 percent of everything
6950563 it wasnt an easy thing to do but i had very good positive reinforcement from my mom and dad
6950564 i know that im where im at now because of my speaking skills
6950565 what kid wouldnt look at that and say you know whatever ive got i need to work a little bit harder and i can overcome whatever problems i might have
6950566 he certainly is a good example of overcoming a disability
6950567 he doesnt let it bother him at all he has always been genuinely enthusiastic
6950568 i gave him the responsibility of taking care of the defensemen and changing the defense as the games progressed
6950569 he just took charge and got his point across to the guys
6950570 they said thank you for making one of our childs dreams comes true
6950571 he really played with his head on a swivel he had to
6950572 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6950573 reps are cherished in this league as a quarterback so i mean every single rep whether it be a game or practice i try to make the absolute most out of
6950574 so these reps have been great obviously everybody wants to play so i just try to make the most of every single one
6950575 when that comes ill deal with it thats part of the game too but until then no
6950576 i did have an injury and was out some things happened and competition is a part of this game
6950577 it happens everyday out here with a lot of positions for some reason quarterback is a position in the nfl where it doesnt happen as often especially when you are a high pick
6950578 you can be 14 2 and lose your job you can be 2 14 and lose your job
6950579 sometimes you can be 2 14 and keep your job i dont think about it its not something that you live with every day as far as coaching goes
6950580 when coach martz came in he told me the more i understand what hes trying to do the more ill like it
6950581 i see it i see it its going to be fun this year
6950582 hes a regular guy when it comes to being a teammate
6950583 the thing ive gotten to learn about him is his work ethic is pretty impressive he knows hes a pretty special player hes gone about it impressively
6950584 we had a meeting with 25 players who felt like a team we havent felt like that for a week
6950585 evidently the boston thing was something he wanted to change
6950586 i had a great 12 years in new york managing the yankees it was time to go somewhere else
6950587 the guys have received me with open arms its been great
6950588 it feels like im on vacation im here for another month or two after this i dont know whats going to happen im living day by day
6950589 the clubhouse is a little looser were just having fun thats the way its supposed to be
6950590 id say hes changed how everybody reacts around here hes really loose any clubhouse he comes into hes going to make it looser whatever it was whether it was him or us were playing real well right now
6950591 i think the attentions going to follow him the curiosity what hes going to bring to us
6950592 mannys presence and how its changed the personality of the team has helped the guys understand theres a lot of baseball left
6950593 im not sure he wants to be the voice i think hes come in here and basically been himself i think hes surprised all the people have jumped on his coattails i think we were developing a personality we liked before manny arrived i think manny was able to combine the fun part with the work aspect
6950594 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
6950595 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
6950596 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
6950597 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
6950598 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
6950599 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
6950600 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
6950601 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
6950602 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
6950603 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
6950604 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
6950605 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
6950606 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
6950607 i feel like im playing really solid and much better than i have been all year to be honest i really look forward to it
6950608 there was a lot of uncertainty staff wise whether wed be retained
6950609 there were a lot of rumors and a lot of stuff flying around we had never been bad we just kind of hit the wall a little bit
6950610 we played so poorly you just wondered if what youre doing is really good
6950611 we had put so much into it all spring two a days my first thought was we should go back to the i formation
6950612 probably if we didnt have that success we would have gone back to the i
6950613 i think charlie coming in there was no question that wasnt great for us
6950614 i got some e mails and notes from people when i took the job and they wanted coach gone
6950615 i said coach we need to talk about this before the season starts
6950616 he said charlie im going to coach somewhere next year
6950617 everybody is spread out and anybody can get the ball at any time
6950618 if hes 45 years old after that first championship hes probably got five major schools after him especially the second title
6950619 but hes as content as anybody to finish his career at appalachian
6950620 if youre a versatile quarterback youve got to be looking at us
6950621 youve got west virginia and now michigan and florida and utah that are locked into the spread offense if youre not at that level then weve got to be the next choice as far as what were doing its got to be fun to be a quarterback youre a running back youre a thrower
6950622 being named the u s flag bearer for the closing ceremony is almost like winning a gold medal maybe even better
6950623 i thought i could win a gold medal in competition but i never thought id have this opportunity i am truly truly so proud to be an american citizen and part of the u s olympic team
6950624 you understand why this is the year you dont need to go into it in detail this is the year to make it happen if it doesnt happen i think changes are going to be made im not sure what direction but i see it coming
6950625 you try to gauge talent and its tough to go in that direction because talent doesnt always win
6950626 it comes down to cohesiveness of a unit how well guys work together how much they want it and how hard they work there are a lot more factors that go into creating a championship team than just talent
6950627 since my last suspension ive been handling myself in the manner of a professional athlete
6950628 it was an unfortunate situation which happened to me this last little incident but like i said since my last suspension ive been doing everything right
6950629 maybe we dont have the best 11 defensive players but maybe collectively we have 22 that can make 11 in certain spots
6950630 those of us that have been around have learned its not fun to say a lot anymore
6950631 i could say lots of stuff who cares its about what we do on sundays
6950632 especially during draft time i thought id be out of here
6950633 but im here and im going to put all of that behind me i know you guys will hound me about it every day until week 7 when theres no more trades
6950634 its going to be drastic because we used to pass so much
6950635 if we can at least run a little bit it will open things up on the outside
6950636 it would be nice to start but thats not my goal
6950637 starters only play the first play for sure i want to finish
6950638 i hope we learned that it takes more work monday through saturday because thats where we lost last season
6950639 we didnt get overmatched in the second half we didnt execute the simple things because we didnt put in time outside of meetings to study our playbook to know every detail
6950640 its all about knowing where your help is and when youll have it
6950641 everybody should be excited to come out here and work get better and get ready to go to the playoffs
6950642 there are things we work on that need work and we correct them we try to improve on them the next day and then add things if we have them in then good and we move on to something else if we need more time on them then we try to tune those up before we move on to something else that is the way it always is just a normal camp
6950643 shawns under everyones wing im still under vrabels wing still under adalius wing
6950644 i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room and on the field they have a great group of guys in the locker room i think that is all you can ask for coach belichick understands football and understands his players he puts us together as one and we come together as a team
6950645 in ways we are very far ahead of where we were last year
6950646 we know what we can do its not about getting lined up in the formation and running the play now its about getting into a better play if the play we called in the huddle isnt the one we like the best when we line up on the field those guys can adjust because they know the signals and routes
6950647 in chicago we are known for defense hats off to the offense i want them to play well and be one of the top offenses the top offense in the league but as far as im concerned this is where the buck stops this is where we need to be dominant
6950648 youve got superstars at almost every position on our defense
6950649 our offense has great players good veteran leadership with olin kreutz and that offensive line weve got good skill position players special teams youve got brad maynard were a very solid team all around
6950650 it wasnt based on just the preseason games or just training camp not one thing just a lot of different things
6950651 now its just all about the offensive unit and knowing what everybodys going to do and just kind of tailoring things to the way that we like it
6950652 i feel like even if i am banged up im still better than anyone
6950653 we still have to go out there and prove ourselves we didnt do anything last year
6950654 we know what they can do theyre very high level players and should complement the guys that are already here
6950655 yeah it could have been kind of predictable last year
6950656 but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
6950657 we dont want to get ahead of ourselves we dont want to be a team thats talking playoffs and all this and we come out and get our butts kicked its the one game at a time one week at a time approach
6950658 of course we have goals we want to win our division we want to go to the playoffs everybody knows that but were not going to be talking about all that stuff our goal is to beat dallas on sept 7 right now thats it
6950659 he wanted everything perfect always so focused on the goal not saying that coach z isnt as competitive or intense but hes got a different way of going about it he can make a joke he can keep it a little bit light and people arent on pins and needles around him
6950660 hes not going to get too excited hes not going to get too down he just zips along consequently the players respond that way they start to emulate the head coach hes an exceptional leader
6950661 hes done a great job with this team attitude wise i think the guys are responding i think the guys are enjoying it theyre having fun at practice he generates a great optimism
6950662 doctor i have a lot to do i cannot fall sick give me all the ammunition to fight the enemy
6950663 my goal is to be back for the first game
6950664 dan has done an excellent job running the steelers and has been a great contributor to the league
6950665 we believe he deserves the opportunity to continue so were working toward a resolution on that basis
6950666 this has been a new process for me and its not been the most enjoyable process
6950667 i can throw i have been able to keep my arm in shape i can certainly lift weights with my upper body and my lower body so i feel ive been able to stay with my strength level as far as when and how much time i need well just have to kind of wait and see
6950668 when the dust settles hopefully people will be pleasantly surprised
6950669 i have no concerns at all that itll start coming around
6950670 i think when you see the attitude our ability to run and protect up front theres a lot of positives you can draw from in whats going to be a really good offense i think at the end of the day
6950671 they know if its run right and guys are doing the things they should do we have a chance for success

6950788 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6950789 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
6950790 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good
6950791 if you can hold them to one run an inning its not as demoralizing to your team we were able to stay in and come back and win it
6950792 i was trying to be too perfect with it and i was far from it on that one
6950793 the key to the whole game was we didnt get abreu out at all
6950794 he wont chase bad pitches thats probably why he is as good of a hitter as he is
6950795 i think weve done our homework on him and faced him enough so that we have a pretty good idea how he pitches
6950796 what you have to do is make him throw it over the plate you cant chase it
6950797 the ones cabrera threw at the end might have had double hit me on them
6950798 i didnt pitch my greatest it was six innings of survival it was like boy scouts just making do with what i had
6950799 ill be excited that maybe wont be in the lineup and recognizes everything that comes out of my hand
6950800 i knew he was a good catcher but hes a great receiver
6950801 hes really good he blocks the ball better than i thought he did what he brings behind the plate a wealth of knowledge against the hitters is great ive enjoyed throwing to him i think weve gelled pretty quickly
6950802 the first day there was a little bit of uncertainty early because i wasnt sure how hitters react to him you use those first three of four innings to get a bit of a read today there was much more rhythm
6950803 weve had nights like this where weve come in here and im explaining why we lost or how we lost we found a way to turn it around tonight and have a good win

6950931 ello no debe entenderse desde una vertiente optimista sino que se interpreta como que los esfuerzos por visualizar este delito especialmente reprochable desde las vertientes penal y social por la absoluta y m xima vulnerabilidad de la v ctima no alcanza todos sus fines
6950932 podr a existir una absoluta impunidad en bolsas ocultas de maltrato a los mayores al concurrir la ventaja a adida de que el trinomio mayor maltratado vulnerable nunca denuncia el hecho
6950933 todo ello provoca que el oscurantismo de esta conducta permanezca manteni ndose la dependencia f sica y emocional del maltratador ante su agresor o agresores dado que pueden concurrir varios agresores del mismo entorno sobre la misma persona
6950934 enquistadas en una forma de convivencia y es el oscurantismo de las relaciones y de los lazos familiares lo que propicia la impunidad de las mismas
6950935 ya que en m ltiples ocasiones se trata de un hijo del agredido o agredida con problemas mentales quien le propicia las referidas agresiones

6950967 desde muy chiquitito mi abuelo me ense a a torear yo tendr a unos seis a os despu s toda mi vida he querido ser torero desde peque o se me inculc la afici n a los toros y siempre ha sido mi sue o
6950968 el miedo te supera o te puede cuando no eres capaz de poder con el toro con lo que tienes delante
6950969 en el triunfo sientes una gran satisfacci n despu s de la tensi n a la que te has visto sometido durante todo el d a de los nervios del si saldr bien o saldr mal cuando todo sale bien y cruzas la puerta grande la satisfacci n es la sensaci n de las cosas bien hechas de pensar que todo ha salido bien que he estado bien en la plaza y entonces tienes un relax tremendo mantener en esos momentos los pies en el suelo en lo que a m respecta nunca me ha costado siempre he tratado de tenerlos y siempre he pensado que el triunfo es muy importante pero que ma ana es otro d a y siempre hay que tratar de mejorar y buscar que cada d a sea una nueva jornada de triunfo los grandes grandes en cualquier profesi n ya no s lo del toreo han sabido asimilar tanto los triunfos como los fracasos precisamente por eso son grandes
6950970 del d a que se torea lo peor son un par de momentos cuando est s en el hotel antes de vestirte en la siesta se es uno de ellos despu s te empiezas a vestir y parece que ya comienza todo pero esa espera antes de vestirte en la que te mentalizas pensando en qu va a pasar y tienes las dudas de si habr viento si van a embestir los toros o no es un momento muy tenso despu s hay otro momento un poquito antes de que salga el toro en el que est s esperando para ver c mo va a ser el animal que tambi n es muy duro adem s hay tardes con plazas en las que tienes m s presi n y otras donde est s un poquito m s relajado pero esos dos momentos son siempre tensos
6950971 uno nunca se acostumbra a jugarse la vida nunca cuando empiezas ves a las m ximas figuras y piensas que ellos ya no pasan tanto miedo porque est n consolidados pero ahora creo que no es as que no es verdad que cuando est s en figura todav a tienes m s responsabilidad y te sientes m s presionado porque la gente espera mucho de ti
6950972 yo sufro mucho cuando toreo cada vez m s antes no sufr a tanto por mi familia pero ahora sufro cada vez m s antes era m s joven y no pensaba en esas cosas ahora todo esto tiene mucho m rito porque pasas miedo por todos por m por mi mujer por mi hija aunque es muy chiquita y no se da cuenta pero yo lo paso mal por ella por mi madre por mi familia por todos quieras o no sufres por ellos porque lo pasan muy mal porque quieren que est s contento que todo te salga bien
6950973 para m la familia es un gran apoyo y sentir ese apoyo de los que m s te quieren desinteresadamente vale mucho y lo valoras sobre todo cuando te juegas la vida cada tarde valoras mucho m s todas esas peque as cosas por eso los toreros son muy maduros en su comportamiento en general porque ven la vida desde otro prisma y lo valoran todo mucho m s incluido ese amor familiar te das cuenta de lo que es estar con tu madre y con tu mujer y eso lo vives intensamente tambi n es cierto que el torero tiene mucho mundo interior pero yo me apoyo m s en mis amigos y en mi familia que en la soledad no obstante hay momentos en los que necesitas mentalizarte y buscas esa soledad pero para m el apoyo de mi familia de mi mujer me ayuda much simo no soy un hombre de estar solo a m me gusta estar acompa ado y si es bien acompa ado mejor
6950974 lo primero que siento si me dicen la palabra toro es respeto y una profunda admiraci n ante un animal con esa bravura es un animal nico en el mundo no hay ning n otro animal que tenga la bravura del toro de lidia del toro bravo el crecerse ante el castigo el ir a m s el embestir hasta morir eso es impresionante el torero es la persona que m s quiere y admira a un toro aunque sea contradictorio porque lo tenga que matar pero esto es as para eso nace este animal para morir en una plaza de toros y conservar de esa manera su especie m s que sufrir cuando tengo que matarlos s es verdad que ha habido veces que he pensado que hab a toros que han merecido el indulto y no se lo han dado pero tambi n es cierto que el toro bravo es un animal que no perdona absolutamente que si puede y tiene la oportunidad te mata es animal irracional y como tal no tiene sentimientos no sabe qu va a ocurrir por lo tanto eso es una de las cosas que hace que el toro bravo no sufra l vive el momento y su bravura le impide ese sufrimiento eso es muy diferente a que t en un momento dado hayas pensado que ese animal ha merecido el indulto
6950975 lo mejor del toreo es cuando cuajo un toro bien a lo mejor a otros les gusta m s la salida a hombros o cuando ya has triunfado no lo s para m desde luego el mejor momento es cuando estoy a gusto con un toro y lo estoy cuajando tengo al toro en la mano y lo que pienso lo que yo tengo en la cabeza me sale perfecto eso para m es la mayor satisfacci n cuando ves que est s cuajando un toro que est s a gusto que est s sintiendo que est s creando una obra de arte de alguna manera te llegas a olvidar de que tienes cuerpo eso pasa yo lo llamo abandonarte de alguna manera est s tan a gusto que te abandonas puede sonar a expresi n artificial eso de que te olvidas del cuerpo pero es verdad cuando t te abandonas todo brota con naturalidad y eso es realmente el toreo cuando todo sale con naturalidad
6950976 el toreo no son gestos forzados en el toreo de verdad cl sico el arte brota de verdad de tu cuerpo sin t buscarlo por eso pienso que el arte se tiene o no se tiene t no lo puedes perseguir el toreo es el arte entre las artes no hay nada que se pueda comparar a l en una corrida de toros est n presentes otras grandes expresiones art sticas como es la m sica la escultura la poes a ha inspirado a grandes artistas de la pintura de la poes a de la danza de todo el toreo ha sido fuente de inspiraci n para todos ellos y sa es la prueba m s evidente de que el toreo es un arte
6950977 sin duda hay que ser torero dentro y fuera de la plaza y ser torero fuera de la plaza es serlo en actitud no es decirlo no es postura es actitud y c mo es eso siendo educado siendo amable ser en definitiva un caballero un se or y buena gente eso es ser torero fuera de la plaza todo lo dem s es mentira ser torero no es estar con una postura determinada es tener actitud de torero
6950978 yo soy muy autocr tico no me conformo con poco siempre busco estar mejor pero lo bueno tambi n es que yo s c mo he estado soy autocr tico pero s hasta d nde he podido llegar y cuando no he podido hacer m s tambi n lo s no soy autocr tico de intentar buscar siempre la faena perfecta sino que soy autocr tico con el toro que tengo delante que es como hay que ver a un torero t tienes que analizar a un torero con el toro que tiene delante no pedirle que haga lo que t esperas ver de l con un toro que no tiene un pase yo hay muchas veces que con toros muy malos he salido satisfecho y a lo mejor no ha tenido repercusi n ni eco en los tendidos

6951078 limaginaire a pour r le ici de permettre de retrouver cette dimension plus archa que qui si elle tait mise en uvre dans la r alit rendrait la vie deux impossible
6951079 une part de notre imaginaire rotique est en effet constitu e dimpressions souvent anciennes de r ves diffus dont la symbolique et le sens nous chappent de prime abord

6951082 certains sexologues conseillent de garder ses fantasmes pour soi explique willy pasini
6951083 le conjoint peut ne pas appr cier par exemple les intrusions dans le lit conjugal dinconnus nayant pas plus voir avec le r el quavec lui
6951084 une femme peut tre g n e dapprendre que pour la p n trer son partenaire pense une autre femme dit willy pasini
6951085 cest le mari qui dans ce cas peut ne pas appr cier
6951086 depuis quelque temps pendant nos rapports sexuels confie t elle nous nous laissons aller imaginer que nous avons entre nous physiquement une amie

6951090 le fait de penser dautres personnes r elles ou imaginaires pendant quon fait lamour est un comportement courant selon willy pasini

6951105 i think the players will get to grips with what we want to play and i believe at the end it will be a playing style the whole world will fear
6951106 we have the bulk and the speed we have everything we just have to put it together so that they utilise the opportunities that arise by rounding off the moves
6951107 i must make it clear we want to play a total rugby expansive game we want to throw the ball around we want to use all of our players so that they can enjoy the game and so that the spectators can enjoy the game
6951108 if you look at our starter moves and the way we manage to break the line its all coming into place but after that the decision making from there is one thing that the players are not used to
6951109 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me

6951122 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6951123 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse
6951124 obama has apparently lost some support but we are still in a lock
6951125 weve essentially been in a holding pattern since the nominations were wrapped up

6951132 our libertarian candidates represent a return to the fundamental principles of american government individual liberty personal responsibility and limited government

6951250 im so sorry miguel you know i would never intentionally hurt you
6951251 now its my turn to come clean i havent stop thinking of you either because after you i never really felt the same way about a guy and at that time you knew i was leaving to another school and their was less than two weeks before the school year was over and i didnt want to deal with the fact of having to leave you
6951252 my voice raising slightly thats not an explanation thats an excuse we couldve tried the summer we couldve tried to make it work but you choose not to
6951253 i dont wanna keep my friends waiting for me the movie is probably passed previews by now

6951258 just dont take too long as she finshed saying this she makes her way toward
6951259 i hold her in my arms as i whisper neither could i thought it would take a forever to meet a girl as good as you i lean in making the move to kiss her
6951260 when we stopped i had to ask her will you go out with me
6951261 no i said i just didnt feel the same way i did before
6951262 yes i move in closer towards her i do know and i will keep caring for you if you would still like to be friends

6951267 she laughs you havent changed a bit but i hope to see you later in life
6951268 i smile back well when you gotta go you gotta go
6951269 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6951270 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6951271 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6951272 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6951273 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6951274 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6951275 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6951276 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6951277 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6951278 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6951279 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6951280 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6951281 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6951282 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6951283 hey would it be alright if i called you sometime
6951284 with every single letter in every single word there will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl
6951285 after having not seen each other in 3 years while you were away at school we started hanging out again because of the wednesday night poker games that jason and i were throwing every week when we first got together shortly after that you took a gamble on me
6951286 if we still want him to paint the manse he is available
6951287 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6951288 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district of san francisco place its coming from a faithful place
6951289 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6951290 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6951291 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6951292 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6951293 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6951294 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6951295 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6951296 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6951297 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6951298 the president wishes to allay fears that an all out war will be launched by the saber toothed cat fossils found
6951299 wow look at that beautiful pirouette nastia did on the uneven bars
6951300 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6951301 the president wishes to allay fears that an all out war will be launched by the saber toothed cat fossils found
6951302 in my darkest hour i didnt have anyone to call
6951303 what you too i thought i was the only one
6951304 and all who call on the name of the lord will be saved
6951305 as a man thinks in his heart so he is
6951306 la inteligencia emocional es la capacidad de reconocer nuestras propias emociones las de los dem s y saber manejarlas es motivarnos a nosotros mismos y aprender a gestionar las relaciones con los otros

6951311 an expectation by financial market participants that financial crises will never occur would create its own form of moral hazard
6951312 and encourage behavior that would make financial crises more rather than less likely
6951313 no other industrial country has the central bank also doing prudential supervision
6951314 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6951315 as you get older sometimes its best not to hold grudges for what happened at a young age while you was in school
6951316 one trigger would be if they are unable to rollover their debt in a profitable manner
6951317 the best stories can usually be told in one sentence
6951318 i never loved another man the way i love you
6951319 your legacy is not forgotten you live on in our hearts and minds
6951320 whenever my sister comes over she always give me a bath

6951346 the whole aim of our work last month on the ruby demo for amd was to show that the quality of offline and real time work is identical starting with this generation of gpus the following presentations this month are just introducing lightstage and how it makes characters or any cg object look 100 real in those real time environments

6951348 the processor will be featured on a new graphics card from amd called the ati radeon and will go on sale in a few weeks for 200 the graphics card which will also be built into some new computers and possibly video game consoles someday will be able to show special effects in games that many of todays graphics cards dont most pc games let you turn off those features if your processor cant handle them amd is hoping that it can appeal to developers who want to create games that are of movie quality it also hopes that moviemakers will use the extra horsepower so they can render film faster and if they want make movies more interactive amd calls this strategy cinema 2 0

6951351 all of my life i have been extremely sensitive to energies in june 2006 i became very ill with pneumonia which was quite a surprise to me as i had not been sick in years something i attributed to my own understanding of the mind body spirit connection i allowed that for reasons unknown to me the illness must have something to do with my own opening to the new energy this was confirmed for me when shortly after my recovery i was able to translate the many energies i could feel around me into words and this opened up to a whole new level of interdimensional communicating i was told that i was reclaiming an ability that i had in the days of lemuria but that it would not fit in my physical body as is hence the pneumonia made room in my lungs for what could not previously be brought through my biology as ancient encodings within my dna were activated since then i have translated the energies of many different nonphysical beings into words and now frequently engage in this kind of communication

6951363 saturday is a big start for me and the team
6951364 not to make amends im not here to make amends im here to do my job and thats to win ball games thats what i would have like to been doing the last three years it just hasnt worked out that way
6951365 im not looking for other things to go wrong and i dont expect them i dont know what tomorrow brings but i know right now i feel good
6951366 its just something weve gone through a lot this year and well have to get through this stretch as well
6951367 consistency comes with putting the same guys on the field and weve had a carousel of guys whether it be injury or suspensions so on that part its been frustrating
6951368 but we have to keep fighting through it and making sure whatever changes we do make everybody is confident enough to carry out what we try to accomplish every game
6951369 and you have to respect a guy who has done a lot for this club im sure he was upset about leaving i know he didnt want to leave and hes got something to play for as well
6951370 everything takes time and i think the more he does it the better he gets at it and right to the point when he gets good we might get marcelo back
6951371 we have to get six points in these two games because going down into the last couple games its not going to be easy to beat teams at home you have to get maximum points at home thats the bottom line
6951372 i think it is a must win you cant go into a game at this juncture in the season knowing with the amount of guys we have out right now we have to go in knowing we have to win this game if not then theres a problem
6951373 it is profoundly disappointing to see surrogates for barack obama attacking cindy mccain particularly after obama himself claimed that families are off limits and pledged to speak out against attacks on spouses in this campaign if barack obama expects the american people to believe he is a man of his word he has a personal responsibility to condemn this ad
6951374 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time
6951375 it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6951376 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6951377 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6951378 im really excited to get back in here were in a playoff race
6951379 hopefully i can contribute help out do whatever it takes i feel great

6951392 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6951393 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6951394 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6951395 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6951396 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6951397 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6951398 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6951399 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6951400 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6951401 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6951402 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6951403 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6951404 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6951405 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6951406 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

6951408 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6951412 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6951413 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6951414 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6951415 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6951421 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6951422 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6951423 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6951424 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6951425 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6951426 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6951427 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6951428 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6951429 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6951430 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6951431 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6951432 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6951433 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6951434 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6951435 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6951436 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6951437 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6951438 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6951439 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6951440 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6951441 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6951442 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6951443 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6951444 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6951445 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6951446 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6951447 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6951448 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6951449 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6951450 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6951451 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6951452 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6951453 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6951454 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6951455 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6951456 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6951457 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6951458 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6951459 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6951460 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6951461 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6951462 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6951463 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6951464 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6951465 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6951466 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6951467 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6951468 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6951469 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6951470 stay on this road for 200 meters and then ask someone else
6951471 you dont look like a person who can tell your left from your right
6951472 stay on this road for 100 meters and then ask someone else
6951473 come down sv road and make a left at the color plus store
6951474 then just ask for khar gymkhana everyone knows where that is
6951475 learn about the buying habits of people in the united states
6951476 the work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
6951477 a subsidiary of the north american islamic trust which is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia
6951478 i actually like people that do not repudiate their past
6951479 it is clear that a debate has again arisen on the significance of the 1980s the temptation is great to relate everything that is now said one on one to the present day
6951480 i agree with the observation that the turkish government is not doing enough on actually carrying out reforms to lead to an improvement in religious freedom and contribute to a change in the attitude that exists among part of the turkish population in relation to other religions religious freedom and the improvement of the situation of religious minorities in turkey are therefore continually recurring topics in bilateral contacts with the turkish government
6951481 to make the conclusion that the finger is pointing to god is pretty far fetched it is pointing that way in order to direct people as to where to push the button
6951482 we want to show that there is only one way to reach god and that is up and through jesus
6951483 la farnesina italys ministry of foreign affairs is providing the moroccan consular diplomatic authorities in rome all the resources so that they can carry out their assistance and diplomatic protection for the senator
6951484 freedom for determining the ways of advance of their respective countries
6951485 damage either socialism in their country or the fundamental interests of other socialist countries
6951486 this is all to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
6951487 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims are not
6951488 it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religion and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking
6951489 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
6951490 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we reject it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
6951491 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
6951492 could lead to discrimination between a muslim and a christian living in the same country
6951493 is discriminatory since it violates human rights the constitution and national unity
6951494 if organ donations are from the third or fourth degree of the family then there is less of a chance of a trade happening as its not likely that family members will sell organs to each other
6951495 the road from 9 11 through chechnya to bali and now mombasa is a clear one
6951496 small al qaeda groups can infiltrate in and out very quickly weapons are available everywhere it is not complex these are not large groups of people just two or three who plan for a while and then launch several rockets
6951497 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that
6951498 it is important to have a muslim statesman as the countrys national leader we will promote this idea not only to the president but also to anyone willing to offer himself as the future leader
6951499 the country is in need of a leader who is not just a politician or the chairman of a political party we need a statesman who can take on great responsibility for the sake of the countrys development
6951500 our idea is purely a suggestion we think all future leader hopefuls will accept this idea because islam is a rahmatan lil alamin blessing for the universe
6951501 ramadhan is a holy month it is better for them to close shop if they refuse they should expect us and our affiliate the banser to pay them a visit
6951502 we ask that those locations be permanently closed after all who can guarantee that they will abide by the law
6951503 the authority have already acknowledged their illegal presence but for some reason they are still allowed to operate in other words it is as if the regency endorses prostitution
6951504 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
6951505 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others
6951506 300 licensed gun owners politicians and local government officials have set up a civilian militia
6951507 local patrons have already supplied guns and ammunition to civilian militias and police auxiliaries
6951508 our cvos will help the philippine national police to secure the towns and population centres
6951509 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6951510 i saw three illegal immigrants escape the temporary reception centre and i found them at a bar completely drunk later with the help of an official from the municipality i made them get in the car and i took them back to the centre
6951511 this is not a matter of racism it is a security problem in many cases these people have not yet been identified and i cannot allow them to go around the town endangering the peace of tourists and residents
6951512 in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna
6951513 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked
6951514 with the intent to eliminate the times standard and tri city weekly as competitors and destroy competition
6951515 it is a real buzz to get back there and actually drive the track
6951516 i had some fans with me to watch the first nationwide race this year and they got debris in their beer cans
6951517 thats all they could talk about was how they were sitting so close that they got debris in their beer cans bristol is a great place its one of the best tracks we go to because of the atmosphere
6951518 people ask me all the time which racetrack is my favorite and before they can even get the question out i tell them its bristol
6951519 bristol is racing heaven a super fast short track with unbelievable banking and its only gotten better since they repaved it after the spring race in 2007
6951520 now you can race high and low and it opens up the track for more passing and better racing the two races at bristol are by far my favorite of the year daytona is daytona and indy is indy they are historic pressure packed and prestigious but bristol is just awesome bristol is fun fast paced challenging edge of your seat racing everything i love about racing
6951521 you just have to realize that more than likely youre going to make someone mad or youre going to get mad at someone else
6951522 you cant help it youre turning 500 laps around the place thats a lot of time to get into it with someone
6951523 races at bristol are always crazy but they seem to get a little wilder when were racing at night
6951524 i dont know why the night races seem to have more wrecks maybe its because the fans are so hyped up by the time the race starts the drivers just feed off of their excitement
6951525 i think we are close i think we are competitive
6951526 we still need a little bit more speed to be in our comfort zone of what we want but we have made a lot of progress over the summer we just get into those final 10 races and see what happens
6951527 carl has shown a lot of strength i think we have over the last few weeks as well kyle has been rock solid all year so you know those three are the obvious ones
6951528 but when you get into the chase and that points margin closes up there are going to be some other guys we will need to think about and worry about as well we are just going to keep doing our jobs and give 100 percent and hopefully get the job done
6951529 in all of the years that i have been racing i have never taken anything to my car like a good luck charm
6951530 but at michigan a nice lady working in the napa suite handed me a furry monkey she told me that i had a monkey on my back and she wanted me to put the monkey in my car so i could get the monkey off my back
6951531 i carried it with me and i think we got it done he just rolled around in my car and behaved we ended up finishing in the top 20 we had a solid run all i wanted to do was compete and be competitive we accomplished that on sunday
6951532 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6951533 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6951534 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6951535 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6951536 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6951537 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6951538 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6951539 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6951540 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6951541 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6951542 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6951543 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6951544 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6951545 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6951546 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
6951547 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6951548 we will have to see what other issues were present
6951549 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6951550 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6951551 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
6951552 doesnt come out in the u s until october he is already talking his next project
6951553 it will be a very big production visceral and intellectual
6951554 they dont even have a script yet we are way ahead
6951555 angesichts des geringen und sehr unregelm igen durchflusses kann die menge des betroffenen materials nur gering sein
6951556 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6951557 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6951558 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6951559 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6951560 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6951561 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6951562 this could mean death by a thousand cuts for many threatened and endangered species
6951563 the creation of an arbitrary deadline could enable even the most harmful projects to escape endangered species act scrutiny
6951564 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6951565 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6951566 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6951567 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6951568 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6951569 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6951570 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6951571 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6951572 i didnt like soul man it didnt make any sense to me
6951573 one of the lyrics said i was educated at woodstock what does that mean there wasnt a school at woodstock
6951574 it was written following segregation we were black men we were soul men it took me many years to understand that
6951575 everybody was always pushing the gangs out but we included them
6951576 they liked the power of working security but didnt like being around gay people they did it anyway
6951577 people want to think all these problems have gone away but it hasnt
6951578 we try to fool ourselves into thinking it doesnt exist being gay is still the worst thing you can be in this country hopefully we are making an impact
6951579 i will always be appreciative to the man who put sam amp dave on the map
6951580 i do this concert for the memory of the bald headed one but im sorry im doing it this way
6951581 he has indicated he is going to waive but until a court order is signed by a judge on monday its not official
6951582 the families of the victims and the victims have had it brought to mind and old wounds have freshened with the attention thats been brought to that milestone
6951583 michael decided that he didnt want to cause any more pain particularly at this point
6951584 hes willing to devote another year of his life to try to do everything in his power to be sure that dr brown or any other experts of the state would no longer have reservations about his being able to successfully reintegrate into society without his being a danger to anyone
6951585 if he doesnt want to cause pain for the families he will always stay in there it doesnt matter what year it is its painful every day
6951586 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6951587 this essentially means that not only do we have the sharpest digital image taken during your mammogram but this technology is carried through if a biopsy is recommended
6951588 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6951589 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6951590 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6951591 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6951592 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6951593 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6951594 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6951595 desire for change on earmarks and our commitment to get it done
6951596 funding will send your tax dollars back to be used in your neighborhood where it belongs
6951597 not every earmark is bad but my goodness they ought to pass the straight face test
6951598 even though it would be very beneficial politically its hard when a very substantial portion of the conference isnt on board
6951599 then of course came skyrocketing gas prices and the opportunity to draw a real contrast on drilling
6951600 this is a pristine live recording direct from the soundboard
6951601 fox execs are believed to have had doubts the 16 million pic while looking a sure fire hit in blighty because its based on a cult 1970s tv series would sell elsewhere without a major star
6951602 originally published in 1942 the offbeat tale centers on a man who becomes increasingly disturbed when he realizes he cannot account for his activities during the day or even what he does for a living he divulges his problem to the husband and wife partners of a private detective agency and their investigation leads to a series of revelations they could never have fathomed
6951603 how can i expect her to stay with me anymore
6951604 shes not going to want to be intimate with a freak elephant man thats the way i saw myself
6951605 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
6951606 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
6951607 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
6951608 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
6951609 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
6951610 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control
6951611 this war can result in separate bedrooms and sexless loveless marriages 25 years down the road
6951612 many couples are resilient and their relationships last or may even be strengthened
6951613 one woman sends her husband to the bunker in the basement
6951614 its inadvertently sending a message that he cant handle it
6951615 i was good looking before and im better looking now
6951616 the issue is on what level do you do this
6951617 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6951618 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6951619 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6951620 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6951621 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6951622 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6951623 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6951624 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6951625 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

6951646 i share the interest and anxiety of many hoosiers who would love to see evan bayh on the ticket
6951647 i think it could make it a blue state in november
6951648 in indiana hes a favorite son hes an administrator he has been the ceo of the state of indiana he governed without tax increases jobs grew and he showed hoosiers he could govern and i think hes very very much a midwesterner
6951649 the middle of the midwest and the north of the old south
6951650 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
6951651 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
6951652 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6951653 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6951654 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
6951655 being selected as an appropriate audience for a stupid joke suggests that there is something amiss with the hearers sense of humor
6951656 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6951657 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6951658 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6951659 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6951660 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6951661 the hearn family is very grateful to the winston salem and wake forest communities for your support of toms work and for your friendship over the last 25 years
6951662 he was a loving and good natured boy who never complained
6951663 i must end my final goodbye by giving thanks to all of you in and out of wake forest
6951664 you helped me and you often stood in my place i hope in turn i have helped you
6951665 the hate that has wounded us must not be reciprocated on the innocent among us
6951666 im ready to go and i will meet you later
6951667 as always we remind students and parents of the limitations of these and other rankings which they should use as only one source of information as they engage with the college application process
6951668 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6951669 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6951670 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6951671 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6951672 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6951673 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6951674 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6951675 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6951676 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6951677 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6951678 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6951679 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6951680 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6951681 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6951682 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6951683 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6951684 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6951685 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6951686 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6951687 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6951688 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6951689 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6951690 are subject to direction and supervision of the sec and thus are inferior officers not required to be appointed by the president
6951691 the most important separation of powers case regarding the presidents appointment and removal powers to reach the courts in the last 20 years
6951692 welcome news for the sec investors and u s capital markets
6951693 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6951694 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6951695 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6951696 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6951697 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6951698 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6951699 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6951700 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6951701 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6951702 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6951703 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6951704 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6951705 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6951706 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6951707 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6951708 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6951709 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6951710 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6951711 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6951712 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6951713 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6951714 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6951715 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6951716 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6951717 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6951718 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6951719 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6951720 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6951721 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6951722 i have no idea how broken and desperate she is
6951723 did he do it to himself or was it done to him
6951724 see this these are stairs see this this is a chair see this this is a bike
6951725 we dont care if this has never happened before in recorded history this is what happened
6951726 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in the u s and that is a notion that the u s somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders
6951727 we want to make sure our american colleagues understand that the days of overthrowing leaders by military means those days are gone
6951728 he has made everything beautiful in its time he has also set eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what god has done from beginning to end
6951729 i dont think the president would ever pass up an opportunity to meet with the president of the mormon church
6951730 if you dont live in the city ill instantly delete your email without reading it
6951731 i like the ocean and the kids love it here and i love that
6951732 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6951733 the lord will keep you from all harm he will watch over your life the lord will watch over your coming and your going both now and forever more
6951734 so that the influences of upbringing or home school and social environment are wholesome and positive directing us from early childhood on towards and not away from those essential attitudes of personal family and social responsibility
6951735 to the european pakeha woman protester at todays boobs on bikes parade who wandered down the street seeking out every brown skinned and asian male she could find hissing at each one do you like staring at white girls titties do you congratulations on undermining the otherwise dignified human rights protest your team was making by being a blatant racist you confirm that new zealand need not worry over a little nudity once a year but ugly racism every day is by far a bigger problem
6951736 and if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white excuse me than in the republican party
6951737 is still searching for an explanation as to why this hostility blacks toward republicans is as deep and abiding as it seems to be
6951738 what are they republicans doing for the millions of african americans that are suffering

6951740 the bushies can hardly tell russia to stop doing what they themselves did in iraq unilaterally invade a country against the will of the world to scare the bejesus out of some leaders in the region they didnt like
6951741 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
6951742 after government attempts to appeal to employers sense of corporate social responsibility fell on deaf ears

6951759 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6951760 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6951761 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6951762 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6951763 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6951764 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6951765 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6951766 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6951767 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through

6951771 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6951772 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6951773 i will never forget the man who just stayed with me for a day
6951774 he didnt say much and we were not deep friends he just showed up and stayed with me we talked when i wanted to or could it meant so much to me
6951775 it was so helpful to have people say that they were praying for us that we were being remembered in an ongoing way and being lifted up
6951776 i may have forgotten some of them as those first weeks were and are still a blur but i know what we appreciated
6951777 remarks like i guess god just needed another angel or i am sure god did this for a purpose i have to believe that our son did not die either for gods pleasure or to enhance his plans i do know however that god was with us as we walked through the darkest days that was the real comfort
6951778 it helped to be reminded that god was with us in the darkness of this time i know that god grieved with me
6951779 if we say god is in charge of every detail of what happens in life then we are much more likely to blame god
6951780 one of the worst things anyone could say is that they understand
6951781 you cannot walk in the shoes of the bereaved just stand with them and let them tell their story
6951782 we dont advertise so it must have been someone else
6951783 i said what could they possibly do they cant arrest me for this i was wrong
6951784 i completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and not going to my court date

6951791 the gospel of god concerns his son who was born of a descendent of david according to the flesh who was declared the son of god with power by the resurrection from the dead according to the spirit of holiness jesus christ our lord
6951792 this jesus god raised up again to which we are all witnesses therefore having been exalted to the right hand of god and having received the promise of the holy spirit he has poured forth this which you both see and hear for it was not david who ascended into heaven but he himself says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet therefore let all the house of israel know for certain that god has made him both lord and christ this jesus whom you crucified
6951793 he who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all
6951794 being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god displayed publicly as a propitiation in his blood through faith this was to demonstrate his righteousness because in the forbearance of god he passed over the sins previously committed for the demonstration i say of his righteousness at the present time so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in jesus
6951795 yet with respect to the promise of god he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully assured that what god had promised he was able also to perform therefore it was also credited to him for righteousness now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him but for our sake also to whom it will be credited as those who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead he who was delivered over because of our transgressions and was raised because of our justification

6951798 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6951799 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6951800 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6951801 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6951802 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6951842 soy divorciado tengo dos hijos convivo con ellos y con mi ex mujer
6951843 bagiku kamu saat ini tidak lebih dari seorang bocah kecil yang sama saja dengan ribuan bocah kecil lainnya
6951844 aku berburu ayam manusia memburuku semua ayam sama saja dan semua manusia sama juga dan akibatnya aku jadi agak bosan tapi jika kamu menjinakkan aku akan terasa seolah matahari menyinari hidupku aku akan mengenali suara langkah yang terdengar berbeda dari semua langkah lain langkah langkah lain akan mendorongku bergegas kembali ke bawah tanah tapi langkahmu akan memanggilku seperti musik keluar dari persembunyianku dan coba lihat kamu lihat ladang gandum jauh disana aku tidak makan roti gandum tidak ada manfaatnya bagiku ladang gandum tidak punya arti apa apa bagiku dan itu menyedihkan tapi rambutmu berwarna emas pikirkan betapa indah jadinya nanti jika kamu telah menjinakkan aku butir butir gandum yang juga berwarna keemasan akan membuatku ingat kepadamu dan aku akan senang sekali mendengarkan suara angin yang meniup butir butir gandum
6951845 tapi aku tidak punya banyak waktu ada banyak teman yang harus kucari dan banyak hal yang harus kumengerti
6951846 pertama tama kamu duduk agak jauh dariku seperti itu diatas rumput
6951847 aku tidak pernah berkeinginan mencelakaimu sama sekali tapi kamu ingin aku menjinakkan kamu
6951848 pergi dan lihatlah lagi bunga bunga mawar itu kamu akan mengerti sekarang bahwa bungamu adalah satu satunya di seluruh dunia lalu kembalilah dan ucapkan selamat tinggal padaku aku akan memberimu hadiah berupa sebuah rahasia
6951849 jadi kamu tidak ada artinya tidak ada yang menjinakkan kamu dan kamu tidak menjinakkan siapa siapa kamu seperti rubahku ketika pertama kali aku mengenalnya dia hanya seekor rubah seperti seratus ribu rubah lainnya tapi aku telah menjadikannya temanku dan kini dia menjadi satu satunya di seluruh dunia
6951850 dan sekarang inilah rahasiaku rahasia yang sangat sederhana hanya dengan hatilah orang bisa melihat dengan benar hal apa yang terpenting itu tidak dapat dilihat dengan mata
6951851 waktu yang telah kamu habiskan untuk mawarmu itulah yang membuat mawarmu begitu penting

6951855 the only way i can see someone like that being in a u s commercial would be in a nike montage
6951856 it works in a limited time like during the olympics
6951857 but its not about the people in the commercial its about the overall feel and them trying to pull at your heartstrings

6951878 what does education do for you create opportunities open more doors and broadened your horizons
6951879 education is important to african americans why if change is truly the key to success today we need to start somewhere
6951880 i think its a defeatist attitude an attitude that prematurely drains the hope from our youth
6951881 but we want to preach everything that kids can do but the one ingredient we frequently forget to mention is education
6951882 take the one in three million odds to land a well paying job in professional sports

6951885 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry
6951886 in a way that is still true its just that instead of a few dozen cottages there turn out to be tens of thousands
6951887 i was drawn to write about gold farming due to my perception that its a significant phenomenon that academics and development organisations are unaware of
6951888 the indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400 000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900 000
6951889 nonetheless the two are still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
6951890 or at least the edges of a digital underworld populated by scammers and hackers and pornographers and which has spread to the
6951891 when you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet
6951892 the only thing i dislike about getting older is seeing the people i love and respect fade or die away
6951893 we do have suspicion that the rationale for the rejections might be because of the protests and our activities
6951894 comienzo de la crisis financiera m s dura de nuestro tiempo tenemos que hacer frente a una combinaci n compleja e intrincada de aumento de la inflaci n ca da del crecimiento restricciones del cr dito y difusi n de las tensiones de liquidez en el interior de la industria y de los servicios financieros mundiales
6951895 por esta raz n el gobierno espa ol ha convocado una reuni n vacacional de mucho aparato medi tico para dar a entender que est al mando y que toma medidas de las que unas son para dentro de bastantes meses y otras no significan nada es mejor as que no haga nada es decir que siga el ejemplo de los dem s
6951896 why does the media mention the race of a minority in the first paragraph of an article but doesnt mention the race at all of a white person
6951897 but now its more majority rule pure numbers wise there are more whites in america than any other race of people and when editors approve an article thats their take you never need to mention the race of the majority its implied
6951898 is it that the focus on these stories and that horrible man cop drew peterson and others want their 3 minutes of fame
6951899 dont tell me its because of poverty in the aforementioned cases most of theses men are white and earn a decent living
6951900 dog bits man is not news but man bits dog is thats the media
6951901 when is the last time you saw an amber alert with a little black girl or even a hispanic or asian girl
6951902 as far as the interest by the national media in the story i think race probably had an impact
6951903 its a small college in the south its the daughter of simple people who maybe are not important outside of their circle and maybe we dont attach the same importance to them that we do for other people
6951904 were not going to stop until we know something were going to be relentless
6951905 ill ask that god may touch whoever may have done this that they may come forward and bring tasha back to us because we love her very much
6951906 we live in a country where if you slay a hog you go to the fair if you slay a dog you go to prison
6951907 steve jobs eventually will get old i like our chances
6951908 that to me would be probably one of the last steps on a long journey working with usa baseball i have enjoyed my time when i managed the dutch team so i have really taken care of my baseball fix craving this is going to be the pinnacle really of my career
6951909 we have had tremendous competition with russia with australia with cuba recently so we know we are going into a challenging situation and looking forward to coming away with the gold
6951910 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6951911 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6951912 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6951913 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6951914 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6951915 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6951916 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6951917 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6951918 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6951919 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6951920 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6951922 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6951923 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6951924 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6951925 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6951926 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6951927 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6951928 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6951929 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6951930 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6951931 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6951932 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6951933 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6951934 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6951935 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6951936 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6951937 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6951938 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6951939 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6951940 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6951941 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6951942 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6951943 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6951944 this is a planning took where all things are going
6951945 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6951946 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6951947 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6951948 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6951949 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6951950 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6951951 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6951952 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6951953 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6951954 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6951955 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6951956 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6951957 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6951958 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6951959 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6951960 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6951961 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6951962 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6951963 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6951964 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6951965 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6951966 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6951967 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6951968 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6951969 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6951970 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6951971 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6951972 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6951973 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6951974 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6951975 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6951976 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6951977 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6951978 queridos arthur y janet espero que est n ustedes bien
6951979 que es necesario un cambio de enfoque de cu les han de ser los activos esenciales y tambi n un despliegue de capital que permita acelerar la adquisici n de activos digitales ello crear la plataforma apropiada para poder competir en el actual panorama medi tico
6951980 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6951981 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6951982 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6951983 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6951984 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6951985 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6951986 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6951987 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6951988 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6951989 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6951990 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6951991 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6951992 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6951993 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6951994 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6951995 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6951996 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6951997 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6951998 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6951999 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6952000 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6952001 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6952002 factores econ micos globales fuera del control de cualquier individuo o gobierno

6952006 i think bob barr is running a very important race and im encouraging him i havent endorsed him but hes saying the kind of things i like to hear said and i hope he does real well
6952007 but we also have chuck baldwin who runs on the constitution party his views are very very close to mine and he worked very hard in my campaign so for me to pick one over the other is not easy i hope they both together get a lot of votes
6952008 thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided
6952009 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
6952010 im still going through a lot mentally this has completely changed my life im not the person i used to be i was very strong i am afraid of a lot of stuff now i live scared
6952011 if he wants to run for mayor a third time i think its a great idea
6952012 wed love to have him around but thats a decision he has to make
6952013 there was a time he wanted to run for president that wouldnt have been a bad idea either
6952014 you can make an argument that one is too little two is right three is too much or vice versa
6952015 doesnt want bloomberg running for governor and extending term limits is one way to get rid of him
6952016 we benefit from the fact that labor day weekend is sort of the start of college season and many of those students returning come with family and friends
6952017 its not a huge number but its significant in the sense that for about 10 years we saw steady increases in travelers for pretty much every holiday with the exception of 2002 following the 9 11 terrorism attacks
6952018 weve seen it all year that people are driving a little bit less due to high gas prices and uncertainty in the economy in general
6952019 its the first time in my career that my pay is up to date
6952020 it makes it easier especially with the way things are now with the economy
6952021 at first he was skeptical but when i called him last night to tell him he said i could do this
6952022 i had to move out from where i was to a smaller place
6952023 i love the raise i cant wait to see it
6952024 theres going to be a higher standard because of the pay
6952025 there are a lot of officers here that are struggling to get by
6952026 it was a struggle but now i think were getting what we deserve
6952027 right now it tells me that it would probably prevail
6952028 i am kind of a survivor if i am in a fight i am going to fight alone i dont have to worry about anybody else saving me
6952029 could not power on vm admission check failed for memory resource
6952030 hes a high quality player hes great at keeping possession hes got great vision and hes training really well
6952031 we learned a lot about them and they no doubt learned a lot about us
6952032 he has got no need to feel gutted about anything
6952033 jamo is a class act he is a world class keeper and he will keep showing that to be honest i cant remember him making any bad mistakes in the games
6952034 when someone puts a free kick right in the top corner i dont think there is anything the keeper can do about it
6952035 we all know what jamo can do but miracles are not always possible
6952036 what we have got to do with joey is just try to assess where his fitness is
6952037 it is all right to come in and play a game but how will he react after it
6952038 i am fully aware he has got his thing on september 5 and it is highly unlikely joey will be involved with us beforehand
6952039 if he was fit enough and looked strong enough and put himself up for selection that way i would play him before then
6952040 but at the moment it is looking unlikely just because of the work he has missed
6952041 mark viduka will probably be a couple of weeks still because unlike michael owen he missed the end of last season as well and unlike michael he has had an injection in his achilles
6952042 it will be a little bit longer for him but he is close he came back into training two days this week and was absolutely outstanding so it wont be long
6952043 claudio cacapa has not trained with us i was going to involve him at old trafford maybe play him but on the friday he just tweaked his hamstring
6952044 but he is not far off being fit again because it didnt go he just got a warning he had had one the week before so we just eased back on it
6952045 when you play as a striker it is always like this
6952046 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back and play again you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
6952047 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have
6952048 scolari has an unbelievable record in the world game and he has the resources available which are the envy of us all im sure hell do very well there
6952049 you cant write chelsea off when it comes to the title it was so close last season it went right down to the wire
6952050 i thought the key to the whole game was that we didnt get abreu out at all and he wont chase bad pitches
6952051 his velocity was about the same the second and third time around there were some pitches up
6952052 till i went to canada and saw some beautiful hos
6952053 i am still mad at jon stewart does that make me petty
6952054 we got the harpsichord on 6 6 07 it took four of us to carry it into the house mary jo was so emotional that she couldnt even talk it is just beautiful is the wood walnut and the sound is something out of this world mahalo
6952055 after six days of anxious waiting after speaking with you the harpsichord finally arrived in perfect condition yesterday it is without a doubt the most gorgeous harpsichord i have ever seen or heard bar none i would have called to thank you personally but i have a tendency to talk a little too long for my budget it was so kind of you to put the gold banding on it for me as well as my name on that gorgeous soundboard that meant a lot to me
6952056 for as long as i can remember homosexuals have been explaining why gay people have no choice about their orientation and it finally dawned on me that their arguments explain why being anti gay is also not a choice but an innate predisposition beyond our power to restrain this led me to embrace my convictions and stop trying in vain to repress who i am since millions suffer from this same condition im hopeful that my epiphany will help others accept themselves and their convictions too
6952057 if we cant control whom we love thats because we cant control our strong passions but passions can be both for and against and just as gay love is a passion which is impossible to control i now know that my passionate anti gayness must also be impossible to control i might wish i could change but its hopeless my judgmental tendency draws me as irresistibly as their same sex affection
6952058 i used to think that restraint was the key differentiator between animals and men but then it was explained to me that sexual urges are such a deep element of real human nature that its wrong to suppress them this led me to realize that moral urges are an equally deep aspect of human identity and it must be unhealthy to try to suppress them too just as someone may feel a deep desire to have same gender sex i often suffer the seemingly irresistible urge to espouse my views on sexual ethics in fact my desire to express my beliefs is so deeply human that even the first amendment to our constitution explicitly protects it so it must be truly unhealthy to try repressing something as innate as opposition to homosexuality
6952059 who would choose to suffer discrimination fear alienation and family discord i used to worry that this argument would prevent disapproving of any behavior at all since it seems to entail the unusual conclusion that the more despised something is the less anyone can be blamed for it but then i realized that i have been ridiculed called intolerant and fired from an academic post for my beliefs on this subject in fact ive often thought how much easier my life in this culture would be if only i could lay down the burden of believing in traditional morals and embrace homosexuality since no rational person in the united states in 2008 would choose to be anti gay if he didnt have to be it must not be a choice
6952060 the realization that no one straight or gay ever consciously flips a switch to set their sexual preference led me to the recognition that i never chose to be anti gay its not like i went to bed one night thinking supportive thoughts about gayness and then woke up the next morning committed to opposing it its more accurate to say that one day i just sort of realized almost to my horror that i thought gay behavior was wrong i felt like i had been suppressing my innate moral voice because of social pressure before finally coming to terms with it on top of my parents both being pro gay and having lots of gay friends i had actually taken a seminar on gay theory from richard mohr one of the countys most prominent gay philosophers i would gladly have been homo endorsant if i could have been but all to no avail and i clearly cant un choose what i had never chosen in the first place
6952061 which so far is heartbreaking and wonderful despite or because of it being such a rant when my daughter reads it in 4 or 5 years i wonder if it will resonate because society has self corrected or because weve gone even deeper into the rathole of fear i certainly hope it is the former

6952092 due to the unprecedented demand our inventories have been depleted
6952093 we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
6952094 this whole thing started about the time the ruskies made their move
6952095 it may very well be that the usgovt is preparing for the real financial meltdown by hoarding all remaining gold flows
6952096 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6952097 if i dont have something to sell i lose business
6952098 the situation is strange and doesnt fit the normal supply amp demand economic model
6952099 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the commodities exchanges are being used as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets

6952101 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders while i realize the dangerous precedent of allowing the lowest common denominator dictate what is and is not a valid form of expression unfortunately the current tone has totally obfuscated the original aims of the piece while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation due to these profound misunderstandings i simply feel that from an artistic point of view the work has lost the ability to have any valuable impact poetic or otherwise i have not been pressured by the leipziger messe nor by the computerspiele museum in this decision to the contrary they have offered their support in defending the right of artists to speak freely and in whatever context they may choose

6952128 i know we had one as young as 11 last year
6952129 it was so sad i couldnt even imagine me having a baby and im 16
6952130 they just want to learn more for the child and spend time with their moms and sisters
6952131 they dont realize how fertile they are and schools arent teaching them this
6952132 i always knew shed have a baby first because she and her baby daddy are so in love
6952133 i was shooting for 21 hoping that it would never be before that
6952134 thats when my mom had me and i thought that would be a good age and a good point in my life i would be almost out of college
6952135 the reason that we really didnt even think about it was because we didnt have the money at the time
6952136 i want to be home based still productive enough to not have to struggle
6952137 i just want to know what kind of person hes going to be
6952138 what hes going to look like who hes going to look like just everything
6952139 its way too early to know if this is the start of a new trend but given the long term progress weve witnessed this change is notable

6952151 same guy said catcher russell martin who was behind the plate for most of madduxs dozen starts for the dodgers in 2006 when he went 6 3 with a 3
6952152 i dont think burrells walk took something out of maddux torre said
6952153 he was very economical pitch count wise unfortunately he was just in there one hitter too long four one at that point in time was still a winnable game for us
6952154 i would have liked to have started out a little bit better obviously he said
6952155 but i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the park no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win
6952156 there is a convergence of interests now in a change in the roles and missions for american forces and for reductions of troop numbers
6952157 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6952158 what can i say this is the best turnout that we have had in a while and it could not come at a better time
6952159 i really believe that advertising especially the stories in the local paper helped us out immensely
6952160 it is a great cause and i am proud to be part of this i have been duck hunting for too many years to remember i hope that my grandkids will one day be a part of this
6952161 i have been a duck hunter for most of my life
6952162 whether you are hunting in the woods or in the marshes preserving the land becomes an important part of your life that is why i became a member years ago and plan on remaining a member for years to come it is a great cause
6952163 just like so many others i have been hunting most of my life it was something that has been handed down to me and i take this seriously
6952164 i have lived and hunted here all my life this local chapter of ducks unlimited has given me a chance to give back to something that means so much
6952165 it is nice to see a big crowd out this year i can remember back 20 or so years ago when we would have 400 to 450 folks of course it was all men back then now it is more family oriented and that is a very good thing i really dont think the economy has had that much to do with the smaller crowds 200 last year in the past few years i think the guys just did a great job of getting the word out to the public that plus bigger and better prizes and auction items didnt hurt either
6952166 but we could have had a few more folks ease in while the meal was being served regardless it was a great turnout and we are very grateful to those who made it such a success
6952167 when you start out every year you have to expect to win
6952168 for us we expect to go deep in the playoffs and keep playing from there as far as we can were not just going out here to play a 10 game season
6952169 all the previous teams and players have set a winning tradition and were looking to continue that
6952170 kaseys a great player who just broke out last season
6952171 hes part of what makes this offense go we also have some depth at running back and an overall good group to work with
6952172 we feel good about a lot of those skill positions
6952173 we have a lot of good experience back there but a lot will depend on how the offensive line comes together weve had to put together a new group there and thats where things need to happen for us to make our offense go
6952174 were quick were strong were going to get to the ball and make the play the only thing we really lack is height weve had a very good defense here for years and thats something we take pride in we expect nothing different
6952175 were going to face a lot of different teams that we dont know much about
6952176 we have our work cut out scouting those teams this year but the bottom line is we have to show up every friday night ready to play
6952177 its a neat thing for the kids to open up at reliant
6952178 its a great venue and a chance to make some of their dreams come true and wed love to end the season at state on that same field we open up on
6952179 on wednesday a british television journalist was detained and roughed up by police as he filmed a free tibet protest police later said they thought he was part of the protest but there was no apology
6952180 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
6952181 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again

6952222 any relevant evidence in the case will be put forth in court
6952223 i think its pretty hypocritical for the secretary to look at other agencies and departments and grandstand when he has different standards in his own shop

6952240 mccain is loosey goosey and romney is buttoned down business romney tends to be programmed and mccain is anything but
6952241 if mccain asks romney to be his vice president it will be for the same reason john f kennedy asked lyndon johnson because he thinks he can win not because he loves him they dont have to hug they can have offices in different buildings
6952242 the youth and exhuberance of romney vs the tough hard bitten age of mccain probably plays to romneys advantage in terms of being selected
6952243 romneys got a mastery of the economy which is helpful because mccain by his own admission has less experience with that

6952252 you must have heard about the story of lakhinder and behula lakhinder was once bitten by a snake and died soon after that but then his wife behula prayed to mansa devi who then after being pleased with her granted back her husbands life to him since then our forefathers made this a tradition to worship mansa devi by getting bitten by snakes with this faith that mansa devi would save them anyhow

6952315 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges

6952318 i feel that some of your polices are beginning to depart from deeply held traditional canadian values and you are transforming the face of canada with the mandate of a minority government you also have a majority in the house of commons who voted on behalf of canadians to support the request made by american war resisters to remain in canada i believe you are turning your back on a majority of canadians on an issue that is very important to us that is not the sign of a democratic prime minister somehow canada has always been a little bit different and we have always been proud of that we dont want to be more like anyone else sir in the name of decency compassion and a higher justice i request you to allow american war resisters to remain in canada as conscientious objectors please dont send them off to have their lives and families desroyed by an unjust war your decision to begin deporting american war resisters lacks decency and compassion i strongly urge you to reconsider your position

6952327 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq
6952328 im sure that this will be approved by the parliament as soon as they come back from vacation and they get their act together
6952329 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
6952330 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
6952331 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6952332 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6952333 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6952334 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6952335 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies
6952336 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6952337 because he was deemed not to be a security threat

6952339 explores the human side of globalization exposing the many ways it uproots people in latin american and asia driving them to migrate at the same time u s immigration policy makes the labor of those displaced people a crime in the united states illegal people explains why our national policy produces even more displacement more migration more immigration raids and a more divided polarized society

6952423 is getting the girls phone number the same thing as getting a date with her
6952424 im not going to make any excuses but sacks werent our biggest goal
6952425 our biggest goal was bend but dont break this year our goal is attack attack attack and go straight to the quarterback
6952426 hes got really long arms and gives phenomenal effort every play we have three of those guys there at end
6952427 if you can get pressure out of your base defense then youre way down the road ahead of everybody else
6952428 its just that this year were going to get to show it i feel comfortable saying that
6952429 actually im superman because im superhuman and hes batman because hes got all the tools
6952430 i think we need a sack in every 10 pass attempts
6952431 every six attempts we need a hurry or a pressure
6952432 we should have a lot more sacks this year because were going to get them not just on third down but also on first and second
6952433 were going to be going to them not waiting on them
6952434 a lot of times it just came down to aggressiveness
6952435 wed play for a screen where there wasnt a screen sometimes wed drop linemen into coverage and not even rush the passer
6952436 was go tell him last year that we were taking him out of the rotation
6952437 i had a feeling about him in spring training he was just throwing the ball great and was really really consistent
6952438 his sense of how to pitch is unbelievable and with his experience he knows how to get hitters out
6952439 he obviously doesnt have the power fastball like he used to anymore but hes still the same guy hes been for the last three years
6952440 he makes a living away he doesnt like pitching in and he makes you get yourself out
6952441 i know he has pitched against us at least twice maybe three times every time its been a little different
6952442 im not there every day to know why but i would have to say hes probably executed his pitches the way he wants to
6952443 ive just been pleased ive been able to go out there every time its my turn and pitch well
6952444 it depends on what his motivation is is it something we want for him more than he wants for himself
6952445 i think he could get it if he decided to and i think the excitement of this year maybe will motivate him to do that i know it would mean a lot to him but hes also understanding of how much this game takes you away from your family
6952446 i could be one of these people that only cared about myself and be like im just gon get it forget everybody else in houston but im not like that
6952447 i wanna help everybody else and help motivate and tell them look man we need to get off our you know whats get out there and get it cause i feel like were not grinding the way we used to

6952455 the united states secret service has dispatched a protective detail to assume the immediate protection of sen joseph biden d del a source tells abc news indicating in all likelihood that biden has been officially notified that sen barack obama d illinois has selected him to be his running mate
6952456 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6952457 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6952458 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6952459 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
6952460 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6952461 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6952462 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6952463 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6952464 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6952465 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6952466 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6952467 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6952468 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6952469 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6952470 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6952471 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
6952472 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6952473 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
6952474 joe is tough sen biden rather is tough hes also a remarkably gifted public speaker

6952477 i have been collecting foxfire books for some 20 years now i was so happy to find these books have so much important information from the past for our future lest we forget
6952478 a real big surprise for me cause ive been asking around about the gun laws here and generally understand that its very restrictive so many various permits are needed and separate permits if you want to transport your gun to the range and even then for a good chunk of the year guns are banned from the streets because politicians tend to get shot guns arent practical or usable for self defense with laws like this i hope therell be positive effects from what happens in iligan when the fighting stops

6952483 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6952484 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6952485 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6952486 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6952487 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6952488 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6952489 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6952490 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6952491 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it

6952550 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
6952551 obama will require that employers provide seven paid sick days per year to their employees
6952552 obama will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be included in the fuel supply by 2022 and will increase that to at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol by 2030

6952560 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6952561 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6952562 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
6952563 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
6952564 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
6952565 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
6952566 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
6952567 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
6952568 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
6952569 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
6952570 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
6952571 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
6952572 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
6952573 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
6952574 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
6952575 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost

6952579 obviously this is a situation where the similarities are striking
6952580 so i tried it on of course it didnt fit me
6952581 its bad enough that employees who exercise their right to refrain from union membership are forced to pay fees to a union they do not want
6952582 but teamsters bosses are violating the law by compelling nonmembers to fund strikes and organizing activities which seek to corral even more workers into forced unionism
6952583 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6952584 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6952585 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy

6952591 store is so dirty but hey they have awesome prices
6952592 i let that stupid girl at customer service have it im so smart and shes so dumb i rule
6952593 she would like to have a meal with oprah winfrey
6952594 and thats why we decided to give a part of the profits from the tournament to mira
6952595 hes given so much to the people and now i feel like we are giving back to him

6952635 anybody who wants to cast aspersions about our program about drugs i can just say one thing they can go to hell we are ready at any time at any hour to be tested
6952636 but we all have to be realistic we cant be utopian doping is to sport what criminality is to society and there will always be criminality in society

6952689 the country has seen a new phenomenon of cheer girls in cricket but the visit of these political stalwarts to the house of a terrorist and extending their support and sympathy to his family is disgusting
6952690 earlier there used to be around two ceasefire violations a month along the loc but after mid july there has been a spurt in the incidents

6952692 the pakistani army is basically giving out signals to the separatists in the valley that we are with you also it is trying to gain public sympathy back home
6952693 the terrorists have been in the launch pads for quite some time now in nearly 40 camps in pok pakistan occupied kashmir and in punjab and balochistan that are out of the public glare
6952694 given that the majority of infiltration bids have been foiled the pakistan army is now trying to utilize separatist elements like syed ali shah geelani of the hurriyats hardline faction to foment trouble in the state
6952695 the terrorists are desperate as they have not been able to execute any major incidents in the state and they got an adequate opportunity on aug 15 in the form of the azadi rally which acted as trigger for the seperatists call for independence

6952737 there was a genuine consensus that the systems broken that the state land is valuated differently across the park
6952738 and that is a function of how well the towns have been able to negotiate with the office of real property services and the strength of their local assessors
6952739 there was a general consensus that this is part of a larger problem of the tax load on the private citizens across the state but especially in the park where the burden has increased and the number of state mandates has increased
6952740 they are a missing a whole value component we call intrinsic value
6952741 we are going to take this information and figure out an improvement plan for the sidewalks
6952742 having this information helps if we want to go after any funding we will be able to make a better case
6952743 it is one of the smallest sections of the budget historically
6952744 its the worst and most travelled sidewalks in the village that we hit first
6952745 all together i would say the average condition of the sidewalks would be fair

6952752 she was really proud of the job she was counted on to do every day she really loved the thrill of it
6952753 she was a strong enough person that she was able to keep things in order and minimize the chaos when the orders came flying in when the salesmen were disorderly she would keep them in line
6952754 it was a high pressure technical kind of job she loved it she would really see the doom and gloom of it she would really be thrilled by the high volume she liked being busy

6952766 a site map or sitemap is a web page that lists the pages on a web site site typically organized in hierarchical fashion this helps visitors and search engine bots to find pages on the site site maps can improve search engine optimization of a site by making sure that all the pages can be found this is especially important if a site uses macromedia flash or javascript menus that do not include html links site maps do have limitations most search engines will only follow a finite number of links from a page so if a site is very large additional strategies besides the site map may be required that search engines and visitors can access all content on the site while some developers argue that site index is a more appropriately used term to relay page function web visitors are used to seeing each term and generally associate both as one in the same

6952774 if i could just get back to texas if i could hold you in my arms tonight the way we used to do when we were young and restless
6952775 it started with jack ingrams first record when we were all at smu in dallas hes become quite a craftsman both in writing and producing im proud to have his name on there he does great work and no one knows the jackopierce sound better than cary plus
6952776 we really wanted to showcase that song in a way that would draw new folks to it the lyrics are amazing and timeless jack is a 3rd generation army kid i think hes read every war book ever written the lyrics every generation makes the same mistakes but still we send our sons away to do the same are universal almost everyone can relate to that in some way
6952777 i couldnt just take a break i needed it to be over i needed to find myself outside of being the guy from jackopierce
6952778 i was in the middle of a painful divorce and it seemed as though my life was falling apart brady and i started scheming on the phone about the reunion while brandt was working on jack
6952779 we both admit that we did not realize or appreciate what we had
6952780 there is a lot more gratitude for each other and for the gifts we have to write and play music
6952781 we have been blessed with the ability to strap guitars on our backs get on a plane and go play a show anywhere in the country
6952782 that is the career i always hoped we would have
6952783 i love the universal theme that is in the lyrics of
6952784 obviously i want people to hear the album and love it
6952785 but when it comes down to it i dont care because this is a totally unfiltered expression of who i am and what i do
6952786 this was a totally different experience and one that felt emancipating
6952787 first i got out of the old label which was major now im just so happy not to be caught up in that big machine thats breaking down for a while it felt like i was on deck of the titanic and i was just supposed to play the violin for myself on the ship as it was going down i know that i was feeling that way and could tell the people at the company were feeling that too but no one could admit it there was bullshit going down all around me and i was extremely happy to get out of it all of course then i had to figure out what the hell to do i knew i wanted to make another record but how
6952788 before long i had an epiphany because i even reached out to other writers and it wasnt working
6952789 i thought maybe im not being specific enough about what i want finally i just went with my gut instinct keep it up soulful happy and real i dont want to do anything but that i dont want to try to accommodate what i think other people want so i was super clear to myself and from that moment everything flowed
6952790 we decided to get back to the roots of recording we all set up in one room and communicated with each other rather than playing to something that had already been laid down to tape so in five days we had fifteen songs down leave the mistakes and keep the vibe
6952791 we completed the whole album in basically three weeks im so excited in a way i havent been in a long time it feels like so much has come together right this time and i think its because im not trying to prove anything anymore
6952792 everything seems based on fear at the big labels today and you cant get music made like that you cant do anything like that this was the opposite of that
6952793 we were going to put it out ourselves solely through go funk yourself records
6952794 then concord got word of it and that we were doing it ourselves and approached us about going through the recently relaunched stax records so we invited them into the studio and played them a few things and they were like we have to have this and it was so nice to hear enthusiasm coming from a company based on what we were doing not based on what we could be doing
6952795 stax is the epitome of what im about that was the original integrated soul music thats the vibe that moved me about soul music when i was twelve and it moves me still
6952796 i want to get on the bus and just go for it playing live is when it all comes together its my thing the part i love the most
6952797 i love the road but when i stopped wanting to pack my bag and get on the bus that was a telltale sign it was time for a change
6952798 so with a heavy heart a deep respect for where she came from and an artists hunger to evolve heidi newfield flew the trick pony coop
6952799 right away we just clicked right away i think he got my song sensibility and was right on track with it loved that i wanted to step out from what i had been doing kind of get out of the bar room for a minute
6952800 thats the way i feel like a record should be made
6952801 its been creative and fun and professional and just a total joy
6952802 from the moment that we started in on it we all three just sort of looked at each other and went ok wait a minute this is really a special song
6952803 i still listen to johnny amp june right now after all the writing and going through it and living with it and i still get chills up my spine
6952804 powerful and big and crazy and wild everybody wants to find that kind of a big love in their life
6952805 it takes a special man to watch their spouse get on a bus and go up amp down the road
6952806 this job takes a lot out of you and it is very time consuming and even when youre home youre not sometimes my wheels are always turning and he goes off in that way too but then you have your time together we do a good job supporting one another
6952807 interesting and sad the ultimate joy and the ultimate pain and sorrow at the same time but my mom its weird because i really feel her shes with me very much shes right there with me
6952808 we didnt know what we were doing and we certainly didnt have the money to be running me all over back and forth between nashville but they did their very best to try to support me
6952809 there are parts of this record that are not just about a man and a woman for me
6952810 theyre about my experiences all the way around like leaving the group and my feelings about that the pain and the hurt or the joy of being independent and standing on my own two feet everybody who listens to this record can take these songs and place them in their lives and relate to them
6952811 i wanted to create a body of work no matter how long it took me
6952812 i had no interest in just going in and making another nashville country record that gets thrown out there
6952813 i respect the originality of an artist like dr john
6952814 he created a persona to use as an agent of fearlessness
6952815 no puedo ser el responsable de la conducta ni de los actos de un hermano ni de nadie

6952818 tidak ada salahnya menanyakan latar belakang pendidikan konselor yang bersangkutan setidaknya pilihlah mereka yang mengikuti pendidikan dari universitas yang terakreditasi dan tidak ada salahnya menanyakan kasus kasus perkawinan yang pernah mereka tangani calon klien punya hak untuk menanyakan akreditasi dari konselor yang bersangkutan bila perlu tanyakan apakah mereka memiliki izin praktik yang dapat di cross check melalui himpunan organisasi profesi seperti himpunan psikologi indonesia
6952819 jika sesama jenis besar kemungkinan memperoleh sudut pandang yang sama dari gender yang sama walaupun hal ini tidak merupakan jaminan karena pada dasarnya seorang konselor harus bertindak objektif dan tidak dilandasi perbedaan gender
6952820 yang pernah selingkuh tentu tidak bisa ditanggung tidak selingkuh lagi

6952825 pero el presidente s y parece que en el segundo intento de despegue el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista y se observa que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver
6952826 se gripase o que alguna pieza saliese despedida dando al empenaje de cola y eso derivara en un giro del avi n a la derecha que el piloto no pudiera controlar
6952827 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue
6952828 ser n las cajas amarillas o negras como son conocidas las que lo diluciden
6952829 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6952830 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6952831 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera
6952832 puedo afirmar rotundamente que no se oblig a salir a este vuelo si no se cumpl an las condiciones hay muchas personas responsables t cnicos de mantenimiento pilotos hay una serie de procedimientos muy rigurosos que se cumplen a rajatabla nunca se asumen riesgos porque los tripulantes de vuelo y los pilotos son personas tienen familia y por ellos mismos hablando ego stamente no quieren asumir riesgos nadie quiere arriesgar su vida por un trabajo

6952834 la gente debe ser consciente de que la conexi n ferroviaria con villena no beneficiar a tan s lo a las empresas sino que tambi n facilitar a la llegada de visitantes y potenciar a el turismo y al comercio adem s los vecinos de la foia tambi n contar an con la posibilidad de desplazarse en tren hasta alicante lo que sin duda supondr a una ventaja
6952835 estudiantes vecinos comerciantes y en definitiva a todo el mundo
6952836 aprovechando que en estos momentos se est construyendo la autov a central podr a promoverse un trazado paralelo por el que circulara el tren
6952837 perdamos dinero y al mismo tiempo a los consumidores no se les apliquen precios abusivos
6952838 cada vez est n m s caros y la gente en muchas ocasiones no compra por su precio
6952839 el concejal francisco mu oz dijo en abril que estaba en perfectas condiciones y pilar fern ndez afirm en julio que estaba en ruinas esto demuestra que el pp se ha inventado un cuento para justificar que tienen que hundir la plaza de toros
6952840 esos desperfectos no son ahora un impedimento para celebrar un espect culo
6952841 demuestra que la plaza de toros se podr a reformar para albergar festejos dicen que est en ruinas y eso es un cuento para poder demolerla
6952842 esto es cuesti n de los arquitectos para la celebraci n del d a 7 han dado el visto bueno pero cada vez nos dejan m s claro que en cualquier momento no nos lo permitir n con su firma est n certificando que se haga ese espect culo pero cada vez nos lo ponen m s dif cil la gente puede estar tranquila porque antes de cada evento se hace una revisi n t cnica
6952843 cada vez nos cuesta m s que un arquitecto firme ese permiso porque la plaza no est en buen estado pero mientras que un arquitecto nos certifique que puede entrar gente sin riesgo nosotros lo avalaremos ahora bien cada d a es m s complicado lo que no queremos es que llegue un d a en que elda se quede sin plaza de toros
6952844 una obra que tiene tantos a os no se estropea en dos meses hace cuatro meses se gastaron un dinero en rehabilitar la plaza y entonces s que val a y ahora no es incongruente
6952845 nuestra intenci n de rehabilitar la plaza porque es un hito urban stico
6952846 the cadillac ranch just west of amarillo is a famous route 66 landmark built up in 1974 by said to be eccentric but brilliant millionaire stanley marsh 3 and the ant farm this line of old cadillacs are buried nose first into the ground the angle of the cars are also reputed to be the same as the ancient pyramids at cheops the cadillacs were moved further west in 1997 from its original location due to growth from nearby amarillo the cadillac ranch is another of the must see sights off the mother road
6952847 how about if we add blue to the orange we just made oh look that makes brown
6952848 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
6952849 by seizing the opportunity to pound georgia with air strikes and military incursions vladimir putin russias prime minister is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed
6952850 come into the garden of earthly delights where every bubble smells of mysterious green herbs and freshly picked wildflowers youll leave with the clean of a mountain stream and the shine of the morning sun in your hair and beautiful thoughts of faraway places in your head experience herbal essences shampoo a non alkaline ph shampoo with natural protein your hair will get very excited
6952851 the turnout was tremendous and there were a lot of new faces in the crowd
6952852 it was a wonderful day people were happy and having fun
6952853 for the second year in a row our attendance has increased by nearly 30 percent over the previous year we would certainly like to see this pattern continue
6952854 always planned carefully with the goal of coming in at or under budget
6952855 we work very hard trying to keep expenses reasonable without sacrificing quality which sounds much easier than it really is last year right before our 2007 festival we began to discuss the emerging economic troubles in the u s the impact that could have on our 2008 festival and planning for what lay ahead
6952856 what we want to do is help kids to create a vision for what they want in their life and help them create a roadmap of where they are now where they want to go and how they are going to get there
6952857 in the heterosexual community you have no clue what gay people are going through it just doesnt occur to you
6952858 as i got to know josh more and started to know more about his experience i realized and was sickened by the complete lack of resources that were out there
6952859 i ended up trying to live someone elses life or trying to numb myself from the negative backlash
6952860 there was no road map or mentor for me trying to figure out who i was and how to come out
6952861 theres a more constructive way of achieving that and coming out of the closet becoming okay with it yourself and then letting your parents become okay with it i was absolutely blind to the fact that it would be painful for my parents too
6952862 i love you was something i really needed to hear in my coming out process
6952863 it brings about a vicious self perpetuating cycle its trial by fire and only if youre lucky you get through it unscathed as these generations of youth get to be adults this becomes a problem
6952864 therefore accept one another just as christ also accepted us to the glory of god
6952865 when our daughter came out to us 16 years ago
6952866 i immediately knew that church was the first place i couldnt go it seemed like the most condemning place of all
6952867 when people discover they are the parent of a gay lesbian bisexual or transgender person they can feel isolated lonely confused and fearful especially if they are christians
6952868 a support group such as ours can give them a listening caring ear because many of us have been where they are that was my main reason for wanting to start this kind of group within the church that would reach out to people of faith
6952869 helens experience as it turned out was shared by many people
6952870 these people had felt the same prejudice and family members of lgbt persons felt the same kind of pushing away the actual gay person feels youre afraid you have to stay in the closet along with your child
6952871 ruth and i always accepted their son and we were shocked to find out how negative the entirety of the united methodist church was toward both the parents and the lgbt child
6952872 because to me the love of christ was prevalent over everything to have people picking bible verses to condone the rejection of lgbt persons that shocked me i still am shocked at the hurt we put on people in the name of christ that really bothers me
6952873 it all leads me to say to people as a person of faith to others of faith who would jesus exclude
6952874 when i try to figure that out i cant think of anyone
6952875 the main thing ruth and i are trying to do it make people understand whatever you are is ok
6952876 its not the churchs job to make those kinds of judgements
6952877 these are babies less than a year old almost always if the church is not going to accept these children later hen they discover for themselves theyre homosexual then why is the church baptizing them
6952878 i think the church needs to stop baptizing babies if theyre not going to hold up their part of the baptismal covenant
6952879 i saw the group as a way to break the silence
6952880 silence on the issue of homosexuality within the church feels like rejection and exclusion and silence is also complacency it implies complacency people dont want to talk about what makes them uncomfortable the group is a place where people can talk in confidence and with confidentiality about their fears their confusion whatever
6952881 our mission is be be the living body of the church we are called to be a community with diverse opinions and gifts united as children of god through the love of christ as an open and inclusive church we invite all to the table by belonging to christ we already belong to each other
6952882 im willing to bet most people who quote bible verses regarding why homosexuals should be viewed with derision havent actually read the bible
6952883 are they really basing their prejudices on verses in leviticus its all sort of misinterpretation of the bible
6952884 i thought she was gonna hyperventilate and faint because she was so incredibly happy before then or since then i dont think i have seen her so out of her mind happy as that drive to target that day to pick out her dress
6952885 because ehrensaft sees transgenderism as akin to homosexuality she says she thinks zuckers therapy which seeks to condition children out of a transgender identity is unethical
6952886 suppose you were a clinician and a 4 year old black kid came into your office and said he wanted to be white would you go with that i dont think we would
6952887 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
6952888 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
6952889 we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
6952890 flood people out of their houses rain just good ole swamp the intersections rain were not asking for hail the size of canned hams just rain
6952891 its personal work not editorial so i did whatever i wanted and had no one directing me i want the reader to open up the first page as if hes getting on a roller coaster for a ride when the roller coaster goes up your stomach starts to get into knots when you see the top of that first hill youre about to drop down on its all over youre hooked
6952892 i saw this picture and knew it had to be yours
6952893 were estimating that rupaul will bring in several thousand people
6952894 the amount of advertising weve done should bring in more were bracing ourselves for 10 000
6952895 the two biggest years weve ever had was the year the mayor and city council of greenville had some isues back in the mid 1990s and that success was generated by the press
6952896 the same thing happened in myrtle beach 10 years ago the media and controversy bring out the curious bystanders who wouldnt usually come
6952897 targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
6952898 i strongly believe that we are at a turning point in our country and that obama and mccain represent two distinct visions for our nation and for the role our nation plays in the world
6952899 i became an obama supporter after living two years abroad budapest hungary where i was working on my dissertation and realized how far our image our image as a nation our image as citizens has fallen in the eyes of many other countries i think obama has the ability to start to turn this around first by his desire to listen to others and to build relationships with other nations
6952900 i also wanted to help ensure that the lgbt community is well represented in the party
6952901 i will be a voice for full equality at every opportunity at the convention and will work with the lgbt caucus to ensure our issues are a part of the convention
6952902 actively to make sure our interests are represented in the platform and to try to influence obamas staff on the importance of our issues
6952903 this has been the most inclusive drafting process for a party platform in history
6952904 makes very clear that our party rejects discrimination based on a wide range of issues
6952905 for the first time in the history of our party the platform stands for full inclusion in the life of the nation for transgender people
6952906 we support the full inclusion of all families including same sex couples in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
6952907 full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation i dont even know what that means in terms of acting on legislation or what support means in this context
6952908 it sounds like a willingness to invite the lgbt family next door over for a barbecue injustice will continue to fester if you cannot even use the words lgbt in your platform
6952909 reflects incredible education and persuasive work thats been done by organizations and people and done for years
6952910 i was very pleased to see the first draft of the platform and see gender identity in it i feel we were listened to and our ideas discussed in detail by the drafting committee
6952911 our country cant take four more years of what george bush has done
6952912 we need a real change to ensure americas place of leadership in the world to restore our failing economy to have a supreme court that believes in protecting our rights and freedom and to tackle the big problems of our time like global warming
6952913 thrilled at the opportunity to have lunch with tammy baldwin and barney frank
6952914 a tendency to isolate us encourage objectification and diminish our sense of lifes nonsexual possibilities
6952915 for a long time it has been considered normal to be on the net
6952916 i dont like to think about the number of books i could have read languages i could have learned and friends i could have stayed in better touch with if i had not wasted so much time cruising online these past 12 years
6952917 when i told them i wanted to be a dude
6952918 a fuckin adrenaline junkie i like to blow shit up
6952919 were looking to expand our real estate and development pursuits outside myrtle beach
6952920 i dont see charleston as the kind of place that would welcome this sort of company with a clear history of discrimination
6952921 our company abides by the laws governing fair and equal treatment of all individuals however as a private company we have not been nor do we intend to be forced or intimidated into supporting organized activities that we believe endanger the historic values of our nation and the cornerstone truths on which they are based
6952922 they have nothing to be proud about it symbolized something so much more for our community
6952923 way for gay fathers coming out of heterosexual relationships to connect
6952924 ensure the full equality of lgbt parents and their children
6952925 it was an amazing word of mouth network that started the organization
6952926 it really stemmed from gay fathers who were really diligent in trying to find ways to maintain their relationships with their children
6952927 to look down the coast and not see anything its amazing
6952928 theyll say its the most spectacular place on earth dont tell anybody
6952929 judgin your behavior and your junky routine its time for you to get clean and stop creating a scene girl you aint got shit on me aint got shit on nyc got nothin on this city save all that cryin for the queen
6952930 my interest in this project was to bring back positive soul songs like the motown era but imani takes what ive come up with and does her own thing shes clever and always surprising its inspirational to vibe off what shes doing
6952931 its been more than two years since we wrote the first record so our musical tastes have changed a bit
6952932 weve been living in los angeles where we got into the whole electro pop rock scene when it came time to write the new album we were really inspired by it musically
6952933 we didnt want to make a record that was the same as the first we definitely wanted to create a different sound for ourselves and reinvent the veronicas
6952934 all ive got is my body an im naked for you
6952935 then i lost my hair it went green i had braces i was on steroids and in chemotherapy i thought about how when theres absolutely nothing else youre possessionless would you love someone when theyre bare naked like that you have absolutely nothing not even eyelashes theres no facade nothing to hide behind
6952936 this album has strong themes about going through hard times but instead of being a victim standing up and being counted
6952937 its good to focus on what life has to offer find things that mean something to you its pop music its meant to be fun magic something you can relate to
6952938 existing public education efforts surrounding hiv prevention must be updated to be more relevant and effective at reaching youth
6952939 recruit and train influential african american men and men of color ages 13 24 and take them through a risk reduction program
6952940 who conducted the interviews who wrote up the results if it was the same folks handing out the gift cards i wouldnt put much stock in those reported reductions in rates of unsafe sex and reductions numbers of sexual partners
6952941 its possible that the 300 men enrolled in the program were telling the gift card givers what they wanted to hear in order to keep the gift cards coming or if the gift card givers had a stake in the success of the program its possible the gift card givers were inclined to read good results into inconclusive data
6952942 as a way to compensate them for their time and energy
6952943 it is important for people to know as much as they can about how the virus is affecting our community we are encouraging people to have conversations about hiv and risk reduction tools and techniques
6952944 doesnt think the gift card program is that bad of an idea
6952945 the gift cards are a way of engaging young people and bringing them to the table
6952946 social marketing campaigns are successful and they do work offering incentives for youth leaders to participate in them is not unusual and is a pretty common practice
6952947 we have dialogue with younger people whove never experienced the original aids epidemic
6952948 but we also have a modern aids epidemic we are experiencing in a different way
6952949 we can talk to any marketing expert today and they will tell you that sex sells
6952950 we may not like it but unfortunately we dont get to create the environment we work in if we want to attract the interest of young people we have to keep in mind that were competing with multi million dollar organizations who are using sex
6952951 the key to reaching these at risk persons is determining where they are their habits outside of sexual activities and when they would be more likely to receive health information
6952952 our stand is that abstinence only sex education does not work
6952953 we believe it is harmful in regard to safe sex practices and stopping the hiv aids epidemic
6952954 programming not developed by young people for young people doesnt work
6952955 the governments vision is an equal inclusive society in northern ireland where everyone is treated with respect and where opportunity for all remains a priority
6952956 the importance of respecting the sexual choice of every individual destroying the taboos and doubts of the students
6952957 the initiative seeks to bring the child to reflect on and to modify stereotypes and prejudices as well as to combat homophobia
6952958 there will be no specific intervention response that targets this group it will be a package to address the most at risk groups and well reach them that way but not as a population cohort themselves
6952959 we would have liked to walk a loving spiritual path with him if he had walked that road with us we would still have supported him financially although we would have asked him to stand back and not to give classes if he had walked the path successfully he would have been reinstated in his post
6952960 jareds election is a victory for democracy gay americans are woefully underrepresented in our government
6952961 jareds victory brings us one step closer to fulfilling americas promise of truly representative government
6952962 it is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people the task force action fund is certainly pleased to see that in the opening paragraph of the section titled a more perfect union for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
6952963 this years democratic party platform does more to address policy issues important to the glbt community than ever before
6952964 to help promote the gay agenda mcdonalds paid 20 000 to become an official organizational ally and corporate partner of the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce and secure a seat on the groups board of directors
6952965 afa asked mcdonalds to remain neutral in the culture war the company refused stating they will continue to support the gay agenda including same sex marriage afa has called for a boycott of mcdonalds restaurants
6952966 americas first pro life pro family biblically based mutual fund group
6952967 mcdonalds corporation has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to continue to earn profits and expand their company by alienating such a large consumer base the christian community they are undoubtedly neglecting this responsibility
6952968 while it is crucial for americans to know specifically how marriage inequality hurts lgbt families and their children the details are irrelevant when it comes to law the myriad of horror stories are not the reason for civil marriage its about equality the federal governments discrimination against lgbt families is an abomination it is cruel to deny our families a marriage certificate while simultaneously doling them out like candy to heterosexuals
6952969 that kind of editing undermines the bureaus mission to provide accurate and high quality data about the u s population and according to a paper on the bureaus own website creates a distorted picture of same sex households
6952970 there are legally married same sex couples in the united states
6952971 its a fact that cant be edited out of existence its time to stop faking the data for the sake of people who want to pretend that same sex married couples dont exist
6952972 the south needs more this is a critical time to raise awareness of community and political leaders together we can influence policies that provide medial treatment and supportive services for our neighbors who need it most
6952973 we are a professional team with a mission and we are committed to honoring that mission as the largest hiv aids service organization in the region
6952974 in the depth of winter i finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer
6952975 we want to be a home school friendly family welcoming nature focused troop we think it would be great to celebrate the seasons together take nature walks do crafts and projects and recognize achievement with badges songs and ceremonies
6952976 increasingly families at home and around the globe are choosing to buy organic food
6952977 the government is committed to supporting our farmers as they seize these new market opportunities
6952978 through this initiative government farmers and industry are ensuring the continued growth of the agricultural sector and a vibrant future for organic farming in canada
6952979 i got a great mail from termeh mazhari who works with amp3 pr in new york and has launched a blog to get the conversation going the more the merrier

6952992 there has been a narrowing down of differences between the various countries it is quite a remarkable feat that 45 different sovereign nations should decide to have one point of view over any issue
6952993 if you can pay a little bit less you can get more for your dollar value
6952994 we are busier than weve ever been our sales are up almost 20 percent over last year
6952995 everything else is so expensive saving money on luxury items is a big thing for me
6952996 im bringing in some old cds and dvds because im going to college and im trying to make money
6952997 every day we have 10 or 12 people that get over 200 dollars as well
6952998 probably half the stuff that comes in we fix it take the scratches out of it
6952999 people buy cds its a lot cheaper to buy the cd download it onto their computer and sell it back or even if they keep it its cheaper than paying a dollar for each song
6953000 myself growing up in music and i know theres a lot of kids out there that are interested in playing music in schools and stuff and im a big supporter of young kids getting into music cause thats all i know
6953001 we got to be here while no one else is here and we got like special treatment or something and its just a wonderful opportunity to be able to do
6953002 i think thats cool i mean i dont know how to play but i can learn
6953003 it just felt right to me to kinda pass on a little bit of what i know you know to a lot of the younger kids that are growing up and may be that are really interested in playing or interested in music
6953004 use him as a role model something to look up to say he did it so maybe i can do something like that
6953005 i think its cool just the fact that someone could come from being native american and coming up to be big and being able to play in a band
6953006 its a big deal gets us back to the paved trail will be opened without a detour well be back to a hard surface all the way around the runners bikers roller bladers will have a nice smooth surface to be back on again
6953007 the thing is with gravel it gets wet there are spots there that are definitely loose and if youre not careful you can wipe out pretty easily
6953008 the thing that we have is we have tradition in this town theres no doubt
6953009 weve been talking about that since we ended last season that we wanted to contend this year
6953010 and i think the work we put in in the offseason has brought us to that point and hopefully we can accomplish that this year
6953011 their motto has been from last november that they didnt want to leave any doubt this year
6953012 and thats been kind of a motivator for them in the weight room and from their acceleration and speed work each day weve got to get better and better and try to accomplish their goal
6953013 the last couple of years every friday night our field is just packed with people standing all over the place that field will allow everyone to sit down and enjoy the game its going to be awesome
6953014 people say it adds a lot of pressure but i dont think it does
6953015 i think weve worked hard and maybe we deserve something a little bigger a little nicer i think its good for the community and we can can come together and hopefully leave that field undefeated
6953016 this person isnt someone id want to take care of my cat while im gone because he would forget all about her and shed die but he would feel bad about forgetting when he suddenly remembered on the last day rushed over to feed her and found her dead but he doesnt know what happened
6953017 la idea que queremos transmitir a cada adolescente es que ellos son libres para hacer lo que quieran pero deben conocer las consecuencias de una irresponsabilidad
6953018 este lunes tuvimos dos chicos muertos en carretera es un goteo que no se detiene y en un mes la cifra de fallecidos en carretera puede alcanzar la centena
6953019 a muchos chicos se les encendi una lucecita y vieron los peligros reales de lo que se repite una y otra vez en la televisi n
6953020 a pesar de los a os de trabajo nunca nos habituamos al dolor
6953021 no podemos quedarnos impasibles a la hora de contar a unos familiares que su hijo ha perdido la vida en una accidente
6953022 para nosotros la posibilidad de darle una sepultura digna es una gran alivio porque pens bamos hasta hace muy poco que sus restos estaban en alguna cuneta
6953023 prefirieron suicidarse para no darles satisfacci n porque sab an que si los cog an vivos los iban a torturar
6953024 s lo quiero traer los restos de mi hermano al cementerio de albolote que sepa yo con tranquilidad que est n ah junto a los de mi madre
6953025 mi hermano era peque o y su compa ero era un hombre alt simo y recio
6953026 lleg incluso a pintar la fachada de su casa de rojo y romp a los precintos que colocaba la guardia civil para tratar de controlar sus salidas
6953027 lo pusieron en la tesitura de o legalizaba el crimen o iba a servir a franco para l aquello era una injusticia y prefiri ocultarse en la sierra como otros muchos j venes de agr n
6953028 formaban un peque o ej rcito de personas con disparidad de ideas una especie de mezcolanza donde conviv an anarquistas comunistas bohemios aventureros e incluso delincuentes comunes
6953029 i have a little boy younger than you who knows six psalms by heart and when you ask him which he would rather have a gingerbread nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn he says oh the verse of a psalm angels sing psalms says he i wish to be a little angel here below he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety
6953030 if you enter the fair and win it ill take you to disneyland
6953031 das ist nat rlich nicht befriedigend nur ein punkt aus zwei spielen keine frage
6953032 wir waren zu statisch in der 2 halbzeit das 0 0 ist ein ergebnis was f r uns nicht zufriedenstellend ist

6953039 icf homes perform really well in extreme climates so if its hot it performs well and if its cold it performs well
6953040 this is about 1 854 square feet and we estimate thatll be about 15 a month to heat and cool the house year round
6953041 the concrete goes all the way down to the footing and that footing stays at the constant temperature of the earth because of that the wall then inside that insulation stays that same temperature all the way up
6953042 all houses have to do to resist the wind in minnesota is a three second gust of 90 miles an hour thats it if its higher than that then its above the code
6953043 some of the greater things in life are best unseen thats why we close our eyes when we kiss cry and dream

6953240 ive gardened before ive got a garden at my house right now me and my dad keep one every year im used to it
6953241 ive got lettuce growing at my house that tastes a lot better than bought lettuce me personally id rather eat something out of a garden it tastes richer
6953242 do something positive instead of sitting around thinking what they did
6953243 it allows us to talk to the kids about anything i dont know what it is about being out there but they just open up the garden just pulls them toward it
6953244 out on the street they are hard core and older than what they are supposed to be when they come in here they are like children again
6953245 while he was in that garden for those 45 minutes to an hour we heard nothing from him as soon as he got out of the garden he went right back to being himself
6953246 these are somebodys kids somebody loves these kids i treat them like they are all mine
6953247 the atmosphere just changes when youre in the garden when they go out there they dont want to come in they want to work they want to unwind
6953248 i hope they get that everything is not hard when you put your hands to the plow theres a gratification sometimes its not easy things take time when you see that result youll get a positive attitude

6953256 the date is 3 17 05 when that pump was replaced
6953257 yes sir i i know what he said but i know what he told me i guess thats what this whole thing is about his word against mine

6953261 all of our tools and stuff like any of our saws or something would go bad wed just replace it and the other one gets trashed
6953262 most of the time i went and asked greg if something was coming up that way if anybody ever came back and that way he could go out there and say i told him he could have it thats been the policy since ive worked here its always been a thing if you wanted it and its in the junk you go up and ask for it and if they say no problem you go ahead and take it ive never ever in my lifetime seen anybody denied anything
6953263 ive never hid any of this because it was common knowledge things are taken out of the junk which i did if you could have it if i were stealing i wouldnt have told anybody about it or put stuff out to advertise it
6953264 the bench grinder was replaced this winter we actually had a little bit of free time and was re doing some stuff we removed our air compressor and put the table out from over there and moved it out moved it over and put better lighting in to make our work area better the conversation i had with our employees at that time we talked about the grinder in there i was concerned ive been in the department for 10 years here and i can honestly say in my 10 years no accidents thats pretty good for a department like ours where you work around stuff every day and i know when i was being observed or critiqued by osha or the insurance guy that was what lead me to say ok everybody said we had to plug it in i was more concerned with everyone reaching over it getting into it with pliers and everybody said its not big enough so we went ahead and bought the 8 inch one
6953265 thats correct if you plugged it in it worked the bearing and stuff is old and shot in it but i guess for the age of it i know its been around 20 years and it still works and thats why i set it down so i put it up by the office me and andy geise one of the employees asked me he said can i take that home and go around that maybe i can get that going a little bit better i said well let me say something to greg it was out there for a week and in that time frame i asked him i said you know that grinder were replacing is junk and thats exactly what he said its junk just dont worry about it thats the way it went its always been verbal i told andy and i took it and they all knew i had it at my house
6953266 its always been around here that you could go ahead and use tools and stuff you knew where it was at like i told my guys just let me know when you got it that way if we need it we know where to go get it thats what i did
6953267 no it probably wont never i was the last one to use it several years ago when i took half a rock off out here
6953268 i didnt ask greg because i when butch told me to go ahead and take that wire i assumed and maybe i shouldnt use that word i assumed he already had that cleared butch being an electrician he knew all the electrical stuff in the city and with him saying its no good to go ahead and take it i assumed that was already set because he put it in the junk
6953269 we use it for storage we have junk we throw back in there signs posts and whatnot i usually take them over once a year like our aluminum signs and stuff well put them all in a pickup truck and take them and thats what well replace our tools in our shop and what weve got broken through the year or lost on jobs and whatnot
6953270 ive always been told that if its in there its junk go ahead and take it because thats what it is junk it costs us more to get rid of it than to have it now thats just always been common knowledge when i took the job as long as ive been here its always been that way
6953271 i asked greg two weeks before thanksgiving they were going to give one of the flag poles to the girl up at the bank and one of the paver bricks that go up to the yard that they tore a building down on main street when he was giving that away i asked him if i could have that pipe i asked him at that time because i knew he was giving stuff away the pipe i was going to buy was 273 and i would have gladly paid that if he asked me
6953272 when they moved out of that building out there and they tore down the old wastewater treatment building and moved out there and was tearing down the water plant we had equipment in one of the buildings that all had to be moved out of there at the time i believe there were four buildings two are left we took all the equipment and put down into there we walked out to one of the buildings they did tear down and couldnt make that work to put equipment in i asked about the benches one was in the workshop and one was in the back behind where the wall was torn apart he berquist said they put all new in the new plant he said you can go ahead and have it
6953273 yes sir im positive i knew a new bench would cost me 45 over at menards at that time
6953274 they had lots of speed and we dont we know we are going to struggle with teams like this all year
6953275 theres only so much you can do to counter it once they figured out how much of an advantage they had after about 15 minutes they just kept attacking junior keeper jessica bland played well but youre going to get scored on especially when the opposing team gets so many open chances
6953276 the major area we focused on this offseason was finishing this game last year we had plenty of chances but ended up 0 0
6953277 lauren hoersten was one in particular who took it upon herself to work on that and she capitalized today the second major stress was being calm and cool before you get the ball knowing your options when you get it and then getting it there theres a saying in soccer that the 10 most important people in soccer are those without the ball we were moving extremely well off the ball and communicating
6953278 this was not the way we wanted to start the season what you saw today was two things one weve been distracted by a lot of things such as fairs and weve struggled to build cohesion with players missing practices
6953279 two were still a relatively young teams we only have two seniors we do have the seven experienced juniors but theyre not fully matured yet its a work in progress i felt junior ashley simerly played her most aggressive game in two years shes young and little but we call her brick wall because she doesnt give up
6953280 i credit jefferson i felt they played harder as the game wore on they never give up
6953281 i felt nikki did a nice job shes cool calm and collected back there just what you need for a keeper as a team we just have to be ready for bryan its a chance for us to get revenge on the team that knocked us out of the tournament last year

6953290 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6953291 fell in complete love with your straight forward yet humorous advice
6953292 how do you know someone is a friend you know because they stand up and defend you when it is hard when hispanics needed a friend in congress during the immigration debate who stood up who spoke out john mccain
6953293 sen mccain worked with republicans and democrats alike to form immigration legislation and while the bill didnt pass only mccain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions
6953294 and barack obama obama did not stand up obama did not speak out and when the time came for him to do the right thing he did not
6953295 obama supported measures designed to insert a deadly poison pill to kill the immigration legislation if obama didnt even have the courage to stand up for immigrants how can he claim to have the strength to change the way washington works john mccain is ready to lead barack obama is not
6953296 youve got to be careful when you judge preseason football
6953297 he likes to get along with people he likes to listen to them
6953298 a lucky politician is one who knows how to take advantage of a break when he gets it
6953299 look at his life and there are half a dozen times when he could have failed being abandoned by his father his troubled adolescent years but he seems to weather adversity better than most
6953300 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
6953301 he has this unusual combination of life experiences that dont fit in any stereotype
6953302 he wasnt part of student government he wasnt in any ap advanced placement classes he was a young man concerned with hanging out with his buddies playing basketball body surfing and eating in excess
6953303 my mother was pretty instrumental in helping barack cultivate this internal flexibility
6953304 after the childhood we had different could never be jarring or dislocating
6953305 growing up i wasnt always sure who i was or what i was doing
6953306 push questions of who i was out of my mind
6953307 hes a gregarious guy and he loves people but he also loves his own company he doesnt expect those closest to him to be all things to him
6953308 its not all fire inside of him there are wide cool pools of water as well
6953309 he wasnt trying to get peoples goats or get a rise out of them
6953310 would have two very pithy paragraphs and it would all be in there he was a very good writer he was succinct
6953311 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
6953312 he would tell us youve got to do things right youve got to take the high road
6953313 he would talk about no permanent friends no permanent enemies
6953314 he became very effective at getting people who did initially did not get along to work together and build alliances
6953315 he found a way to be tough and challenging when he didnt like something at the same time he was not one to burn his bridges with people
6953316 black people would say harold will take care of the problem
6953317 the victories were small they changed peoples lives but they didnt change american society and he wanted to do that
6953318 means you can take risks you can try to do things to improve society and still land on your feet
6953319 he was very straightforward and had a no nonsense all the cards on the table approach
6953320 by choosing to move to hyde park he moved in an area where an independent can come out of nowhere to win
6953321 by choosing to work at that law firm he was making a to where he stood
6953322 he worked all the right circles if you dont like the guy hes a calculating politician if you do hes a smart methodical worker he does nothing thats different from most politicians even the reform politicians the difference is hes extraordinarily gifted his greatest capability is he never makes the same mistake twice
6953323 but he never tips his hand to what he thinks you feel youre on stage and have to perform at the end of the day you dont know whether youve changed his mind or not
6953324 some members of both parties thought that barack was longwinded and a tad aloof and arrogant not me
6953325 how much money do you have in your campaign fund
6953326 hes a realist and he knows when to fold his cards
6953327 i know what its like to have people tell me i cant do something because of my color and i know the bitter swill of swallowed back anger
6953328 my gosh you cant lose two races in a row
6953329 he said if its ok with me it should be ok with you
6953330 if you have the ability to communicate and the timing is right the moment is right things come together all those ingredients were there for barack
6953331 hes the one who walked through it and did the heavy lifting
6953332 he tapped into the new technology better than any candidate ever has he knew what to do with the internet and e mail in a way no candidate has

6953362 we need to test more than one or two of the top athletes randomly
6953363 ive been down there to accelerate the program howman said adding that brazil india and nigeria also have lagged in forming independent anti doping agencies to monitor their athletes
6953364 anybody who wants to cast aspersions about our program about drugs i can just say one thing they can go to hell we are ready at any time at any hour to be tested
6953365 but we all have to be realistic we cant be utopian doping is to sport what criminality is to society and there will always be criminality in society
6953366 is a strong message to say were taking this seriously athletes would be pretty darn stupid to take the risk

6953371 moreover i forgive everyone of all their trespasses against me so he forgives me all of my trespasses against him as scripture says
6953372 therefore he continues to forgive me even as i continue to sin so you satan have no power over me the fact is i have power over you and all other unclean spirits as scripture says
6953373 so in the name of jesus christ of nazareth and by the authority he has given to me i command you to go away and leave me alone and take all of your little workers with you back to hell where you all belong
6953374 therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets

6953376 the 3 000 medals gold silver and bronze were made according to the standards set by the international olympic committee ioc
6953377 in case of gold and silver medals the purity of the medals was 99 9 per cent and they are inlaid with jade from qinghai province

6953387 its provenance had been traced to the 1700s but in tests it was found that it is gold alloy which was only used between 1546 and 1552

6953407 die biodiesel produzenten werden von allen seiten in die mangel genommen sei es von der politik den mineral lkonzernen oder der automobilbranche
6953408 die schwierigkeiten f r die biodiesel produzenten sind auch aufgrund der billig exporte etwa aus den usa immens

6953419 they should blind them that way they would not commit crimes any more prison is not the answer they go to prison and form their own groups there inside and they come out more powerful
6953420 if they cant they ought to resign but they shouldnt stay in government positions or receive a salary for doing nothing
6953421 the criminals now engage in drug traffic kidnapping and money laundering among other activities without a central control or management nor any predominant organization among the crime areas or spheres
6953422 because of that criminal activity became competitive using violence with much more frequency among themselves and against society to gain markets territories or positions
6953423 its obvious that society is outraged its obvious that society is annoyed and they have reason to be
6953424 if we cant agree to commitments and to channel those demands into clear and concrete steps then the people could begin to take other types of actions which would not resolve the problem nor help anyone
6953425 the deaf and dumb cast their votes with the influence of relatives and appearances of pictures on the ballot papers because they did not hear or understand the messages of the parties and their flag bearers
6953426 but the point is you want to be able to communicate in your native language
6953427 they also cost more we dont think its fair for someone whos deaf to have to pay more for his or her cell phone than someone whos hearing
6953428 s o sete s o sete casas e eis uma para a qual os americanos n o podem deixar john mccain se mudar
6953429 its what christopher shays has always stood for he goes where the truth takes him
6953430 its not what is republican or democrat its whats right for america
6953431 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house
6953432 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
6953433 i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low
6953434 but i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6953435 i think as we get further along into this tournament the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little more comfortable
6953436 so youve got to go one step at a time
6953437 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6953438 its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too but i feel a little more pressure
6953439 i think my mind set was a little too defensive
6953440 almost like a u s open but not as hard because the rough isnt up
6953441 you have to plot your way around and try to minimize mistakes
6953442 i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low
6953443 but i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6953444 i think as we get further along into this tournament the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little more comfortable
6953445 so youve got to go one step at a time
6953446 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6953447 its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too but i feel a little more pressure
6953448 but i was just an inmate number youre not any different from anyone else certain staff members liked golf and would talk to me about it but a lot of the staff couldnt care less who i was
6953449 i made bad decisions and youve got to own up to your own mistakes i didnt try to hide from anything i didnt take the easy way out i served a lot of time and i paid my dues
6953450 it was a very long period and i never lost hope of getting out early
6953451 but i lost my appeals it didnt happen and i had to accept it i had a lot of support from friends and family to help me get through it
6953452 i was just hoping when i got out that he was still playing at a high level
6953453 id never hold you back from an opportunity like that
6953454 and youll always have a job with me if it doesnt work out
6953455 and he has a great outlook on the future and on living every day to the fullest he brings that to the golf course and i think thats something i didnt have last year on my bag and definitely in my life so its obviously a huge benefit to have him there
6953456 he made a bad decision and ive made a ton of those in my life everyone does but hes ready to work every day and hes very positive sometimes i get down on myself and he picks me right back up i think hes getting better every tournament
6953457 the skys the limit with this kid you always hope as a caddie that youll catch on with the next great player but to actually do it is kind of surreal
6953458 but i was just an inmate number youre not any different from anyone else certain staff members liked golf and would talk to me about it but a lot of the staff couldnt care less who i was
6953459 i made bad decisions and youve got to own up to your own mistakes i didnt try to hide from anything i didnt take the easy way out i served a lot of time and i paid my dues
6953460 it was a very long period and i never lost hope of getting out early
6953461 but i lost my appeals it didnt happen and i had to accept it i had a lot of support from friends and family to help me get through it
6953462 i was just hoping when i got out that he was still playing at a high level
6953463 its a big change but we know he can do the job
6953464 he had a great spring in baseball and hes put on about 12 pounds of muscle were expecting him to carry a load for us offensively
6953465 i played quarterback my freshman year and it was a lot of fun
6953466 i thought it was a lot of fun because you are in on every play as a receiver you dont have as big a role
6953467 hes a good leader and he will be a good field general
6953468 his ability to run the ball gives us another good dimension he gives us that extra wrinkle another weapon
6953469 were not the first team to do that we have good players well be fine
6953470 its a big change but we know he can do the job
6953471 he had a great spring in baseball and hes put on about 12 pounds of muscle were expecting him to carry a load for us offensively
6953472 i played quarterback my freshman year and it was a lot of fun
6953473 i thought it was a lot of fun because you are in on every play as a receiver you dont have as big a role
6953474 hes a good leader and he will be a good field general
6953475 his ability to run the ball gives us another good dimension he gives us that extra wrinkle another weapon
6953476 were not the first team to do that we have good players well be fine
6953477 but im not going to worry about that because some weeks they go for you you just have to remember to stay patient and wait for the good weeks
6953478 for him to have an off day is awkward to see he probably just needs a couple of down days to get rested and get his game back
6953479 theres no doubt that a couple of days rest will do me more good than playing two more rounds at the bottom of the field
6953480 youre nearly better off laying up on all the par 5s and i made a mess of some of them by trying to go for them
6953481 so its kind of a week when maybe youd be better off being a short hitter
6953482 you never like missing cuts and you dont want to do that much
6953483 but i think id rather take a couple of wins and a missed cut
6953484 but im not going to worry about that because some weeks they go for you you just have to remember to stay patient and wait for the good weeks
6953485 for him to have an off day is awkward to see he probably just needs a couple of down days to get rested and get his game back
6953486 theres no doubt that a couple of days rest will do me more good than playing two more rounds at the bottom of the field
6953487 youre nearly better off laying up on all the par 5s and i made a mess of some of them by trying to go for them
6953488 so its kind of a week when maybe youd be better off being a short hitter
6953489 you never like missing cuts and you dont want to do that much
6953490 but i think id rather take a couple of wins and a missed cut
6953491 im a soccer player i just want to play soccer
6953492 hes a phenomenal soccer player he just has a good sense of the game
6953493 he just fit right in and took over with no problem
6953494 its a killer here im going to have to revamp the system
6953495 its tough not knowing whos here and whos not going to be here
6953496 it puts us three or four weeks behind everybody else
6953497 im a soccer player i just want to play soccer
6953498 hes a phenomenal soccer player he just has a good sense of the game
6953499 he just fit right in and took over with no problem
6953500 its a killer here im going to have to revamp the system
6953501 its tough not knowing whos here and whos not going to be here
6953502 it puts us three or four weeks behind everybody else
6953503 our forefathers have been doing this for the past many years but we have no idea why they do it we are doing this as a part of our tradition these poisonous snakes here are cobras and if they bite the person sitting on the carrier he wont get affected because he has some very effective medicines applied all over his body
6953504 you must have heard about the story of lakhinder and behula lakhinder was once bitten by a snake and died soon after that but then his wife behula prayed to mansa devi who then after being pleased with her granted back her husbands life to him since then our forefathers made this a tradition to worship mansa devi by getting bitten by snakes with this faith that mansa devi would save them anyhow
6953505 i said to my partner one thing were lucky about is that weve done so many stadium shows
6953506 well rehearse a little and then show up thursday and hope to do it
6953507 i have my team with me i know what were getting into its not easy but at the end of the day its going to be one of the most historic things ever and how can you not want to be a part of it
6953508 every time you do one of these you try to do something technologically advanced that people havent seen before
6953509 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6953510 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6953511 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6953512 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6953513 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6953514 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6953515 the fed needs to raise interest rates now slowly and predictably to restore confidence in its continued commitment to price stability
6953516 most cars will float and be swept away in 18 24 inches of moving water
6953517 it can be difficult finding the time to be social on all these social sites and some like facebook and myspace seem to take more time than many other there are several ways you can manage your activities on facebook that will increase your presence but dont take up all your time
6953518 i work at insert retail store name here then i can say
6953519 it helps everybody out it keeps everybody in good spirits for everybody
6953520 peoples incomes and wages are flat and their costs are rising
6953521 people are worried that if we dont deal with these issues now that our standard of living could if not decline at least remain stagnant
6953522 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and on the league he never intended for this to be the case
6953523 he has said to me if you need me to resign as a director to serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that as long as it doesnt change anything else
6953524 were talking about a lot of things weve talked about restructuring the board and selling part of his stake to an equity partner who could come in and take some of the pressure away
6953525 it means the diamond pattern on the back window of a pimps cadillac check out supafly or something
6953526 you will according to statistics do most of the cooking dishes laundry floor washing vacuuming and grocery shopping
6953527 when things are this difficult in other areas of our lives we often give up on them we tend to avoid things that make us exhausted but kids are a different story
6953528 we need to let god shine his light on our problems
6953529 entonces alguien dijo que cristo estaba all y mir arriba y lo vi cristo estaba en la cruz los brazos la cabeza hacia abajo su barba sus ojos hasta el ltimo detalle usted puede ver sus costillas y su postura con sus rodillas y brazos colgando al lado yo estaba muy emocionado al tener dos avistamientos en el mismo lugar se confirma que la imagen en la ventana no era falsa

6953552 successful or not is seldom remembered by the public its the celebrities tom hanks stephen king tiger the ones wholl live forever
6953553 by the middle 1980s a certain power status structure had appeared among the companies with ad amp d mistakenly perceived as a mainstream class of its own
6953554 i think that by around 1986 most rpg publishers had bought their own marketing hype that role playing was the big new hobby sweeping the nation
6953555 the illusory success of d amp d was finally outed when its owners 36 million in debt sold tsr to wotc this was then made more interesting when hasbro bought wotc acquiring magic pokemon and tsr with it it became even more interesting when peter adkison left wotc bought gencon from hasbro and formed gencon llc

6953582 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6953583 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6953584 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6953585 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6953586 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6953587 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6953588 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
6953589 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

6953615 he is committed to restoring his good name his career and the cooperative and productive relationships that he enjoyed with pittsburghs development community
6953616 i am contacting you because i know that you have worked with pat in the past and appreciate how much he has given to our city pat wants what each of us wants which is to move forward and get back to work
6953617 was a personal e mail to friends i never intended for the media to obtain a copy i was just doing what any wife would do to help her husband
6953618 while pat may be on paid leave his wife has lost her job they have suffered a loss of income in their family and at the same time an unexpected expense of legal fees for clearing his good name from a political attack against him
6953619 just the goodwill of a lot of good people in the development community who really feel for pat and what hes going through
6953620 had he not been a public official with some authority would they be giving him money if his name was joe schmo and he set up a legal defense fund would the same people be giving him money the answer probably is no
6953621 then why are they giving the money the reason is these donors probably think the donation will be influential in achieving their goals with city government
6953622 are there any hot girls here for a sexy older man
6953623 i found him to be very pleasant personable and professional

6953628 the difference in a post 9 11 world is that the perception of threat isnt likely to ease just because u s troops are no longer actively engaged in iraq

6953642 when i got the call about the dna the cloud disappeared from beneath me and i fell to the ground and crashed
6953643 i was actually keeping my hopes up i just thought the first one failed and theyd do another set do more testing and it would work out this time
6953644 in my mind i was hoping for a better result in my mind i was preparing to bring nellie home
6953645 im just trying to keep a good thought i hope this can lead us to the next step
6953646 are there any hot girls here for a sexy older man
6953647 i found him to be very pleasant personable and professional
6953648 i would hate to think i knew about this and one of my customers was injured due to my neglect
6953649 were just kind of blanketing the area as best we can with the contacts we have im hoping that for every one contact we have well generate 10 more contacts in the neighborhood of the business

6953660 she was really proud of the job she was counted on to do every day she really loved the thrill of it
6953661 she was a strong enough person that she was able to keep things in order and minimize the chaos when the orders came flying in when the salesmen were disorderly she would keep them in line
6953662 it was a high pressure technical kind of job she loved it she would really see the doom and gloom of it she would really be thrilled by the high volume she liked being busy
6953663 she had a great sense of humor and was very strong willed she knew what she wanted and she usually got it she had a special spot she liked to sit at the nursing home she liked to watch the traffic go by watch people come and go and kept track of staff at bingo games she sat by the caller to make sure they called the right letters she was a delightful lady

6953956 it seems the major studios and the big television networks dont know what to do with the internet the news is they are trying to figure out how to make content how to get advertising and how to get started now digital filmmaking of the future is here and it is time for independent filmmakers to jump into the arena so we have jumped in head first we produced an internet series trailers and boom a feature was created the internet is nothing like any media that has ever been when it comes to creating content we can dig right into subjects the studios will not touch beachwood drive is becoming bigger than a broadcast or cablecast program because it is being seen around the world it is not scaled down television or small screen cinema this is something new our viewers watch when they want where they want and what they want this is the next level of video on demand
6953957 heads into the final mix preceding release on dvd film director pritchett is busy putting together a project that has more action than the first
6953958 agape is a black soap opera with an emphasis on urban city living centering on black family life
6953959 i saw people running ducking talking to images and handling objects that were not there
6953960 pritchett is now applying his form of filmmaking to the relationships and the experiences of the back streets of hollywood
6953961 when we looked at agape as a black soap opera i started to follow the same formula the networks follow each episode may feature some of the shows current storylines but not always all of them we also have added lots of action which you dont see on the networks there is of course gun play explosions sex and music that will hold an audience
6953962 this is now the time for making films that can be seen by millions of internet users once the promotional scenes have been viewed by internet users the way has been paved to have your project sold to an established fan base
6953963 it was said by one of the ladies helping us that this story must be told
6953964 im able to produce special effects in my personal studio today that just a few years ago could only have been created by major hollywood companies at the cost of many millions of dollars

6953979 wild irish bog trotters from west ireland cutting out the trees the width of the canal track were set to work knee deep in the wet muck they could wear no clothing but a flannel shirt and a slouch cap and there were no tools that could be used
6953980 in my day we had slow heavy boats ninety six feet long carrying heavy loads of coal or lumber or salt most of the fighting was before that when the packets were running they were light passenger boats built for speed it used to be that if one canal boat got within two hundred yards of a lock another boat couldnt pass it but the packets wouldnt do that waiting for two or maybe three hours time was important to them so all the packets carried fighters sometimes they were men who didnt do anything but just sit around til they came to a lock then theyd fight to see whod go through first
6953981 chippy connolly was known as champion of the erie canal he wouldnt hire a man that wasnt a fighter
6953982 the champion before connolly was john mcmahon one time his driver got into a fight his name was bill stewart and the other driver licked him john said bill i didnt think youd let him roll you around in the dust like that bill said well captain you know before breakfast i cant seem to fight right so john took him over to a canal store and bought him some beer and bread and cheese all he wanted when hed finished eating bill called the other driver off his boat and licked him easy
6953983 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and on the league he never intended for this to be the case
6953984 he has said to me if you need me to resign as a director to serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that as long as it doesnt change anything else
6953985 were talking about a lot of things weve talked about restructuring the board and selling part of his stake to an equity partner who could come in and take some of the pressure away
6953986 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders while i realize the dangerous precedent of allowing the lowest common denominator dictate what is and is not a valid form of expression unfortunately the current tone has totally obfuscated the original aims of the piece while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation due to these profound misunderstandings i simply feel that from an artistic point of view the work has lost the ability to have any valuable impact poetic or otherwise i have not been pressured by the leipziger messe nor by the computerspiele museum in this decision to the contrary they have offered their support in defending the right of artists to speak freely and in whatever context they may choose
6953987 if we dont go on and move its going to continue to deteriorate so were at a crucial point
6953988 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6953989 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
6953990 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern
6953991 the older ladies would teach us how to usher and wear our gloves
6953992 here we are a national landmark building and if we lose it you cant get it back
6953993 i would hate that if we didnt complete this thing you would pass by and say that used to be a national landmark it would be a tragic loss
6953994 people didnt like americans that much i realized its not a great state of affairs
6953995 if i dont know how to optimize a blog for search and build a reputation nobody will ever look at my stories
6953996 the first thing he said to us was we will continue the schulerkreis
6953997 its an opportunity for the pope to enjoy what he would have loved to have done full time namely be a theologian and writer and discuss with his colleagues issues of importance
6953998 were not talking about the next encyclical or what kind of bishops hes going to put in belgium
6953999 i would love to be fair for everyone but sooner or later if they can see through me to god thats what i want to try to do im not god and i cant drive them to god but i can pray for them
6954000 the usoc explained that athletes are free to choose their religious preferences and it cannot be a condition of participation on any team or camp
6954001 some athletes do have an athlete generated daily bible session at the otc but participation is voluntary as far as the usoc knows and the coach does not attend
6954002 they have a responsibility to be inclusive and to embrace diversity and we often think of diversity as a racial or gender thing
6954003 but religion is definitely a big part of it as well
6954004 he has the highest reputation of coaching in the world
6954005 i was really impressed with him and his philosophy on life and stuff and just how he carried himself in general
6954006 i wondered if the olympic training center if it was an appropriate place to be pressing people to decide on their faith
6954007 to me it felt like he did have expectations of people turning toward christianity
6954008 i think that thats something the white house senior staff is working through right now
6954009 regarding medical futility the results indicate that physicians can be reasonably sure they are trusted to make those decisions however they need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
6954010 to get people to understand that frozen is fresher than raw
6954011 if its frozen at sea and handled right properly we can live with it theres not a difference
6954012 we have to get consumers behind us to make a difference in what we eat
6954013 are shucked and frozen within 10 minutes of being pulled out of the sea
6954014 they are a fantastic product and the freshness is unbeatable
6954015 taking advantage of the seasonality of fish by changing menus to reflect that
6954016 we are always going to have demand for hawaiian fish and such but if chefs are aware of their footprints a la fish every little bit helps
6954017 chefs really hate to sacrifice quality even at the expense of greenhouse gas or carbon emissions but awareness will make a difference
6954018 im in a unique position because im located on an ocean
6954019 some people are of the thought you buy farmed fish thats terrible
6954020 were definitely educators in the community i think its so important to teach local people about this especially when it comes to fish
6954021 im not going to say that i dont buy some fish from hawaii or even tobago now and then but we do try to maintain a good balance between sustainable and local
6954022 weve encountered low level resistance because fresh sells particularly in seafood
6954023 restaurants are not opposed to frozen fish they are just more willing to pay a premium for fresh fresh is the single most powerful adjective in describing seafood
6954024 maryland did a good job in the first half that exposed problems for us and in the second half we made some adjustments our guys did a good job and it was nice to come back at maryland and get the result on the road but we still have a lot of work to do
6954025 what if you did this seemingly meaningless thing you put your hand on the wall and you were healed sometimes things happen because we choose for them to happen
6954026 is it that if you can convince me that its real your faith will be more real
6954027 when someone asks you to think about what jesus would do remember that a valid option is to freak out and turn over tables
6954028 we thank you for the miracle of human experience in the birth of our child
6954029 they want their babies circumcised in the comfort of their homes surrounded by family and friends and they want it performed by someone highly experienced who brings spirituality and meaning to the practice
6954030 it makes no difference to the child who does the cutting or what is hanging on the wall
6954031 its still traumatic it still removes a natural healthy functioning body part
6954032 everything is wonderful weve been having some good sleep filled nights colins been sleeping about four five hours at a time
6954033 the benefit to you in dealing with our company us is bla bla bla 1 2 3 4
6954034 what benefit does my prospective customer get because of my point of difference
6954035 weve used our season passes more this year but thats because we take less trips because of gas
6954036 we dont see the drop off that airlines hotels motels and restaurants would see

6954038 the style at gpo was unique and fascinating the clothes were very different from other fashion looks
6954039 in the last 10 years there has been an absolute explosion of retail shopping opportunities
6954040 people can be exposed to the blue green algae in two ways either by contact with the skin or by swallowing it
6954041 the basic message for this weekend is if you see blue green algae floating in the river avoid swimming jet skiing or any other water activity where you might come into contact with it
6954042 blue green algae is eliminated during the water treatment process so public drinking water supplies from the ohio river should be safe
6954043 but i dont want to say something and then sunday spain wins and i look stupid

6954057 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6954058 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better

6954093 i think what happens is people see greg doing all of these amazing things on his talent or his physical ability and forget hes still learning
6954094 i mean we all know what he is capable of his god given ability is astounding and it is scary sometimes to watch him because guys that big arent supposed to be able to do some of the things he can do or run as fast as he does
6954095 i do expect him to be a big factor for us but lets not put him in the college football hall of fame quite yet because he hasnt accomplished anything
6954096 you see those kinds of plays and you realize that he is something special
6954097 but again you have to temper it with the knowledge that he is still raw in so many ways what i like about him is that he learns from his mistakes you combine his physical ability with how coachable he is and yes the sky is the limit
6954098 i dont think about all conference or how many sacks i am going to get or any of that stuff

6954101 i guess two things id like to see happen this year
6954102 the obvious is we win the big east or at least get to a bowl game and also id like to play well enough to help our defense be great and that in turn gets the other three guys on the defensive line noticed and recognized for all conference honors if all of that happens it will be a great season

6954263 i have seen obama speak before during the primary in burlington iowa and that was a great experience
6954264 he really gives a good speech and i think he gives people hope but also something solid and i think thats what this country really needs
6954265 if someone had been on the pavement they would have been killed
6954266 water came into the building when the roof came off and some of our inventory was damaged
6954267 we thought this would be covered by insurance but not all of it was
6954268 it was amazing i could feel the pressure drop me and my dad gregg were in the shop at the time and we stood in the garage and watched the roof come off the building
6954269 so far we have received 31 801 50 for emergency protective measures and 351 739 92 for debris removal
6954270 we hope and expect to receive an additional 9 407 61 for emergency protective measures and 107 154 16 for debris removal plus 10 000 to 15 000 for administration costs
6954271 i was speaking to farmers just this week and they said they could still remember exactly what they were doing at the moment the storm hit
6954272 a lot of people were covered for 500 for the contents of their refrigerators so that helped
6954273 if trees fell in peoples gardens but didnt hit a car or the house we couldnt cover the cost of removing the trees which can be very expensive
6954274 we dealt with some very big claims for roof damage
6954275 the only significant power base that might challenge the regime is the military since kim jong il became chairman of the national defense commission however he has promoted 230 generals most of the armys 1 200 strong general officer corps owes their allegiance to him

6954285 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6954286 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6954287 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
6954288 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship

6954291 during the height of the cold war in the late 50s vogel was the only point man
6954292 an intriguing possibility however is that caffeine can help prevent or ameliorate depression
6954293 if you give an athlete more petrol in the tank they will go further what weve done is to give them 50 60 per cent more petrol
6954294 it has been incredibly hard for exercise physiologists to help athletes in this way and its a dilemma that has occupied researchers for decades we asked athletes to ingest caffeine which has no nutritional benefit and the results were astounding
6954295 we found that the amount of carbohydrate that could be stored by the muscles when ingested along with caffeine was about 60 per cent higher than with carbohydrates alone
6954296 the practical outcome of that is that an athlete training or competing the next day will have a better training session or race
6954297 caffeine has a wonderful effect on both short term sprint performance and on endurance it is a remarkable drug that affects both ends of the spectrum
6954298 the violent physical abuse and sexual abuse from guantanamo to afghanistan and then into iraq this was simply people having fun what you see in the pictures is people trying to have fun
6954299 at the end of the day its the job of government and in fact its the most fundamental job of government to scare the electorate
6954300 if you want evidence you have to make something up based on public preconceptions and the threat from terrorism

6954306 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6954307 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6954308 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6954309 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6954310 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6954311 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6954312 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6954313 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6954314 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6954315 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6954316 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6954317 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6954318 our main mission is the freedom of kashmir nothing else we are not spreading terrorism there is no movement of terrorism in kashmir it is a freedom struggle a simple freedom struggle freedom from indian occupation

6954342 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6954343 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6954344 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6954345 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6954356 between the centro the 800w and the pro we have a great story in the last year
6954357 were very excited about where weve come from and where were going
6954358 everybody whether theyre the it purchaser the ceo or the person who works in the mailroom theyre also consumers and so aesthetics are absolutely important

6954364 i think the issues overall for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6954365 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6954366 today we have some subtle teachers who have gone to secular colleges and have been brainwashed into secular humanism
6954367 and because they have these degrees and they are christians many individuals are brought into seminaries and bible schools
6954368 a nd sic in the process they give the secular idea that we ought to allegorize prophecy or we ought to spiritualize it
6954369 the bowery was very gritty when we first visited it

6954407 argentine basketball star emanuel ginobili is injured and will miss sundays game for olympic bronze against lithuania argentine team doctor diego grippo confirmed friday
6954408 there is no chance that manu will recover he will not play against lithuania
6954409 it was determined that the damage to miles knee was severe enough to be classified as career ending prompting the blazers to request waivers for his release they were given relief by the league from the 18 million left on miles contract this had to grate on every celtic fan as when reggie lewis died the league refused to give the celtics any cap relief now that he signed with the celtics all he has to do is play in 10 games next season and he will be guaranteed the 18 million that was left on his contract with the blazers
6954410 the 22 year old worked out with the nuggets summer league team and the u
6954411 he demonstrated that he not only wants to be a good player but a good denver nugget
6954412 there wasnt a free agent that was in the gym this summer with his own team more than j r
6954413 im probably not the first person to say this but tape delay has ruined olympic hoops for those of us on the west coast i know i could watch it on my laptop or go into a self imposed media blackout until the game actually airs which creates such a time warp y mess that i might never recover from it those would be ideal pure and remotely enjoyable instead i end up trying to do the latter but ending up peeking at live blogs and then end up only half interested in seeing the one sided contest to the end when it actually airs
6954414 as perhaps the ultimate compliment bryants teammates here are raving about him in spite of his numbers he is only the third leading scorer on the team at 14 3 points a game he ranks fourth in steals he ranks sixth in assists he is eighth in rebounding its not about the numbers its about the perception his teammates cant believe this is the kobe bryant who has at various times in this career cast himself as heartless and selfish his teammates see him only as the leader of a defense that has scored 84 more points off turnovers than their opponents and 91 more points off fast breaks
6954415 he came to the campus as a small town basketball star with ideas that stretched far outside the confines of a gymnasium now 45 years later lakers coach phil jackson is being bestowed with an honorary doctorate from his alma mater the university of north dakota jackson will receive his honorary degree monday evening during convocation exercises at the university a 1967 graduate of und with emphasis in religion philosophy and psychology jackson will receive his doctorate from the schools college of arts and sciences
6954416 maybe we should do something similar to the soccer approach and limit it to players 23 and under the real question is whether or not the nba with our increasing global strength can create our own global tournament to replace the olympics and make money doing it
6954417 if forced turnovers are indeed the divining rod of the redeem team the trend is not good after averaging almost 23 per contest in pool play they forced only 11 against australia and 16 against argentina in the quarters and semis of course they still won both of those games but i do think its safe to say that spain has more talent than australia and ill mention again that ginobili played only 6 minutes today the health of jose calderon may play a huge part in this game if calderon is able to play hes spains best option for protecting the ball as promising as ricky rubio is handling withering defensive pressure with a gold medal on the line at the age of 17 is a tall order
6954418 zone defenses can work extremely when used by a less athletic team trying to nullify the athletic advantage zone defenses can become a killer to beat offensively if your team is undisciplined and makes bad decisions no matter how athletic you are in the first half when argentina reluctantly switched to the zone that is exactly what happened team usa settled for 3 pointers didnt share the ball and just didnt play smart overall in the second half they started to pass the ball get offensive rebounds and make smart decisions and it worked

6954464 roy is a dominant pitcher he proved it again tonight
6954465 thats the name of the game you have to get clutch hits when you have guys with an opportunity to score weve been kind of scratching these last few days trying to come up with base hits in key situations and havent been able to do it
6954466 they got a ground ball through the infield in the first inning and then reyes moved to second on a pitch in the dirt they bunted him over to third and got that bleeder over the infield to score him after being down 1 0 there youve got to kind of shut it down there
6954467 i thought i threw a pretty good pitch to schneider
6954468 i think he just cheated guessing on a first pitch heater and went out there and got it it was a pretty good pitch as far as location i was trying to get a first pitch strike down and away i threw it down and away but he was able to hook it to right field
6954469 other than that home run i thought roy was terrific just as well as he threw last time out when he allowed one hit in eight scoreless innings against arizona
6954470 in a normal situation youre going to end up with some runs when youre facing santana its a little tough to scratch anything off him we had him a couple times there we just couldnt get the hit when we needed it

6954474 perhaps it takes emblematic events to make us realize that the government is far from living up to its obligations
6954475 but this time there is growing social pressure and it appears to have a focus
6954476 the bottom line is coordination between the states and federal government and maybe this is going to be the catalyzer
6954477 theres enough political concern that theyre going to sit down and figure out a better way to coordinate
6954478 could be effective if there is the political will to do what needs to be done
6954479 we are sick of the way things seem to be out of control
6954480 perhaps it takes emblematic events to make us realize that the government is far from living up to its obligations
6954481 but this time there is growing social pressure and it appears to have a focus
6954482 the bottom line is coordination between the states and federal government and maybe this is going to be the catalyzer
6954483 theres enough political concern that theyre going to sit down and figure out a better way to coordinate

6954519 they have guns and they hunt it is very disturbing they also raise chickens these are their only interests are you looking for chickens
6954520 i am looking for friends what does that mean tame
6954521 to me you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys and i have no need of you and you on your part have no need of me to you i am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes but if you tame me then we shall need each other to me you will be unique in all the world to you i shall be unique in all the world
6954522 there is a flower i think she has tamed me
6954523 i hunt chickens men hunt me all chickens are just alike and all the men are just alike and in consequence i am a little bored but if you tame me it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life i shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground yours will call me like music out of my burrow and then look you see the grain fields down yonder i do not eat bread wheat is of no use to me the wheat fields have nothing to say to me and that is sad but you have hair that is the color of gold think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me the grain which is also golden will bring me back the thought of you and i shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat
6954524 but i have not much time i have friends to discover and a great many things to understand
6954525 men have no more time to understand anything they buy things all ready made at the shops but there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship and so men have no friends any more if you want a friend tame me
6954526 it would have been better to come back at the same hour
6954527 if for example you came at four oclock in the afternoon then at three oclock i shall begin to be happy i shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances at four oclock i shall be worrying and jumping about i shall show you how happy i am but if you come at just any time i shall never know at what hour my heart is ready to greet you one must observe the proper rites
6954528 they are what make one day different from other days one hour different from other hours there is a rite for example among my hunters every thursday they danse with the village girls so thursday is a wonderful day for me i can take a walk as far as the vineyards but if the hunters danced at just any time every day would be like every other day and i should never have any vacation at all
6954529 i never wished you any sort of harm but you wanted me to tame you
6954530 go and look again at the roses you will understand now that yours is unique in all the world then come back to say goodbye to me and i will make you a present of a secret
6954531 as yet you are nothing no one has tamed you and you have tamed no one you are like my fox when i first knew him he was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes but i have made a friend and now he is unique in all the world
6954532 one could not die for you to be sure an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you the rose that belongs to me but in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses because it is she that i have watered because it is she that i have put under the glass globe because it is for her that i have killed the caterpillars except the two or three we saved to become butterflies because it is she that i have listened to when she grumbled or boasted or even sometimes when she said nothing because she is my rose
6954533 and now here is my secret a very simple secret it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye
6954534 it is the time you have wasted for your rose
6954535 it is the time i have wasted for my rose
6954536 but you must not forget it you become responsible forever for what you have tamed you are responsible for your rose
6954537 i think one of those gym teachers got sick thats why this group is so big

6954543 some people drink deeply from the river of knowledge others only gargle
6954544 i figured if anybody really wanted her they would call
6954545 at one point i wanted to be a journalist then i was at the receiving end now after playing a tv journalist in mumbai meri jaan im more sympathetic towards the medias job
6954546 i understand why they need to ask uncomfortable questions of course i still wont answer personal questions but i understand the journalist has a right to ask what he or she wants to
6954547 my job brings me into daily contact with the media and i watch the news closely recently when we had 23 bomb attacks in 24 hours i watched the full coverage theres too much of de sensitised lurid sensational coverage on tv
6954548 i play one of those hard nosed trp driven journalists i play a journalist who forgets that during those times the people being interviewed are human then i undergo a crisis and change
6954549 though were together in mumbai meri jaan we dont have scenes together

6954552 i dont know when i will go back to tv if my films dont do well i will have to go back but right now im doing films and i hope it takes me somewhere
6954553 it is not that i dont want to go back to my tv image of wearing saris but it is too early to do all that again i have other films in hand also so tv will wait for now
6954554 what i was doing on tv was very regressive i have done nothing for my looks in the film it was all abhisheks vision it was all that he wanted me to do in the film and all thanks to the people who have worked on my styling i just had to carry the character
6954555 my characters name is sakshi and i play adityas farhans wife in the film it is very unlike what you have seen me do on tv i play a more sophisticated character who is a mature girl and very positive of course somebody who can do anything to see her husband happy
6954556 but i dont want that im not a superstar im not saying this for effect im only here to entertain people i keep telling my wife i dont want to be either no 1 or no 2 i just want to be alive and kicking in the film industry
6954557 it is not a great film its an entertaining film thats the kind of cinema i believe in
6954558 its my first home production and ive dedicated the film to my late secretary mr vikas bali and to my father theyd be so proud of singh is kinng
6954559 thats a scary thought and i dont want to think about it
6954560 the print was in deplorable condition and even while giving full attention from only a few yards the dialogues between parbati and her husband were very difficult to follow
6954561 the sound has become inaudible and the film has become obscure the projectionists struggled to raise the volume to almost no effect still the dialogues could not be clearly heard
6954562 the only print of the 1934 film is preserved in a room of a rented house of bfa at mohammadpur in the capital at 26 degrees celsius when the international standard is 12 degrees celsius or less
6954563 mismanagement preservers apathy to carrying out duties the absence of training shortage of manpower inadequate budget and the absence of a permanent building have contributed over the years to bring the archives to this sorry state

6954569 hadis ahad tidak dijadikan dalil dalam masalah aqidah tetapi sebagai dalil amal perbuatan
6954570 kami memandang bahwa imam ahmad dalam masalah aqidah berpegang pada dalil dalil syara secara manqul tidak tunduk kepada hasil akal semata beliau adalah seorang ulama ahli sunnah maka imam ahmad berpegang pada nash yang ditegakkan berdasarkan dalil qathi karena ia dalil qathi yaitu al quran dan hadis mutawatir pent berasal dari allah swt dan juga dengan ucapan rasul yang qathi juga berasal dari allah swt
6954571 jika ada hadis ahad mengenai hukum dia harus diamalkan saya berkeyakinan demikian tetapi saya tidak menyaksikan bahwa nabi saw benar benar menyatakan demikian
6954572 hadis ahad tidak berfaedah qathi dan inilah pendapat kebanyakan pendukung dan ulama mutaakhirin dari pengikut imam ahmad
6954573 apa yang dituduhkan kepada imam ahmad oleh ibnu hajib al
6954574 ijma yang diriwayatkan secara ahad tidak qathi tetapi digunakan sebagai dalil masalah amal perbuatan
6954575 jika saya melihat hadis shohih saya akan berbuat berdasarkan hadis itu tapi saya tidak bersumpah bahwa nabi saw mengatakan demikian
6954576 imam ahmad berkata bahwa hadis ahad adalah dalil yang qathi kalau umat menyepakatinya
6954577 ijma yang diriwayatkan secara ahad adalah tidak qathi tetapi digunakan sebagai dalil dalam masalah amal perbuatan
6954578 bayan dapat ditempatkan brdasarkan urutan berikut al quran sunnah al ijma khobar wahid dan qiyas
6954579 tatkala sebuah hadis terbukti sebagai hadis ahad maka ini tidak berfaedah ilmu dzani
6954580 ada pun pendapat para ahli hadis bahwa ia hadis ahad pent adalah
6954581 pendapat ini menyalahi pendapat para ahli tahqiq dan jumhur ulama walaupun hadis tersebut ada dalam kitab shohihain selama tidak mencapai derajat mutawatir maka hadis itu menghasilkan dzon dalam masalah ini imam bukhari imam muslim dan para imam hadis lainnya dihukumi dengan cara yang sama
6954582 hadis ahad tidak qothi dan tidak dapat dijadikan dalil dalam masalah ushul atau aqidah
6954583 hadis ahad tidak menghasilkan ilmu dzani tetapi dapat dijadikan dalil dalam cabang hukum syariat
6954584 bahwa ushulu fiqh dalam agama harus dibangun dengan dalil dalil qathi bukannya dengan dalil dalil dzani seandainya boleh menjadikan dalil dzani sebagai dalil dalam masalah ushul seperti ushul fiqh maka juga membolehkan hadis ahad pent sebagai dalil dalam masalah ushul ad din aqidah pent dan hal ini jelas tidak diperbolehkan menuruj ijma kesepakatan pent karena masalah ushul fiqh juga dinisbahkan dalam masalah ushul ad din
6954585 syara memperbolehkan dalil dzani dalam masalah masalah amaliyah yaitu masalah furu tanpa amaliyah dalam masalah qowaid ushul ad din demikianlah qowaid ushul ad din sebagaimana dinukil oleh al anbari dalam kitab syarah burhan dari para ulama yang terpercaya
6954586 imam malik berpendapat barang siapa sholat dengan membaca qiraat bacaan pent ibn masud yang tidak mutawatir dan tidak termasuk qiraat para 23 ilmu mustholah hadis ust moh anwar bc hk hlm 32 24 fathul bari juz 4 hlm 156 25 al muhalla juz i hlm 2 26 ilmu mustholah hadis ust moh anwar bc hk hlm 31 27 al muwafaqat fi ushuli pent 28 nihayah fi ilm al ushul 29 lihat majmu fatwa juz 18 hlm 41 page 8 8 shahabat maka ia telah menyelisihi mushfah mushhaf imam yang mutawatir pent dan janganlah sholat di belakangnya
6954587 pendapat sebagian besar fukoha menerima hadis ahad yang terpercaya dan adil serta diamalkan dalam masalah tasyri kecuali masalah aqidah sebab itiqod wajib dibangun dengan dalil dalil yang qothi yang tidak ada keraguan didalamnya sementara masalah amal tasyri cukup dengan dalil yang rajih kuat saja
6954588 hadis ahad hanya menghasilkan persangkaan saja allah swt membolehkan hanya dalam massalah amaliyah tasyri yang menjadi cabang cabang agama bukan masalah ilmiah seperti kaidah kaidah pokok hukum agama
6954589 fardhu amali atau dzan adalah apa yang ditetapkan dengan dalil dzani tsubut dan qothi dalalah
6954590 hukum fardhu amali adalah wajib untuk diamalkan tetapi tidak untuk dalil untuk masalah itiqad maka tidak kafir orang yang mengingkarinya
6954591 jangan tulis hadis gharib ini hadis ahad karena dia tidak diterima dan kebanyakan di antaranya adalah dhaif
6954592 para ulama sepakat bahwa hadis ahad tidak menghasilkan keyakinan dan tidak digunakan sebagai dalil dalam masalah aqidah
6954593 sedang hadis ahad adalah hadis yang diriwayatkan oleh seorang perawi atau lebih yang tidak
6954594 hadis ahad adalah jenis hadis yang diriwayatkan dari seorang perawi kepada seorang perawi lainnya atau sekelompok perawi atau sekelompok perawi kepada seorang perawi
6954595 hadis ahad tidak menghasilkan kepastian sebagaimana dua contoh diatas hadis ini tidak dapat dijadikan sebagai dalil dalam masalah aqidah tetapi diterima sebagai dalil dalam masalah amaliyah praktis

6954627 we are truly blessed to have them in our program they set a wonderful example and exemplify the qualities in all of our boosters
6954628 its very difficult for us because major league baseball is very big business and a lot of players that have potential to play in the big leagues theyre either called up or not allowed to come here
6954629 i think thatd be great but i think thats a decision that major league baseball would have to make
6954630 now that we have the world baseball classic i dont see them probably doing that
6954631 but baseball is such a big business in the united states its the offseason in basketball if it was during the nba season id be amazed if they let em come
6954632 but it hasnt and probably wont for one simple reason baseballs leadership lacks the foresight to see what might be it lacks the creativity to do what is in its own best interest

6954637 i t had become a general war between the muslims and the armenians
6954638 in the entire region from bitlis through van to bayezit we were informed that the damage and destruction had been done by the armenians who after the russians retired remained in occupation of the country and who when the turkish army advanced destroyed everything belonging to the musulmans moreover the armenians are accused of having committed murder rape arson and horrible atrocities of every description upon the musulman population at first we were most incredulous of these stories but we finally came to believe them since the testimony was absolutely unanimous and was corroborated by material evidence for instance the only quarters left at all intact in the cities of bitlis and van are the armenian quarters as was evidenced by churches and inscriptions on the houses while the musulman quarters were completely destroyed villages said to have been armenian were still standing whereas musulman villages were completely destroyed
6954639 we must help georgia rebuild that which has been destroyed that is why im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia

6954644 the illicit trafficking and disposal of e waste computers televisions cell phones is driving a burgeoning environmental and human health crisis in several developing nations in asia and increasingly in africa
6954645 criminal networks can profit by collecting e waste in developed countries such as canada and selling it to recyclers in developing nations
6954646 one of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is is that theyre very adaptable and its not like theyve given up any of their traditional markets
6954647 if it wasnt lucrative organized crime groups wouldnt be involved in it

6954698 it has been a dialogue with the machine that began in the political environment of the 60s with a time of continual interaction within an art community
6954699 we were looking for images that were not derived from the world in this earlier work it was a generation of continual interaction between technology and art where we were learning demonstrating and building in a community of with a network of interests
6954700 the idea of realism slowly came to dominate art in the digital era
6954701 the image itself took the dominant function and the contextual information lost its importance

6954706 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6954707 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
6954708 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good

6954750 we are distressed that our initial analysis of this issue was incomplete and we regret that
6954751 the technique we are working with can tell the difference between healthy enamel and decaying enamel and so in the future if this technology is further developed a dentist could identify early decay using it
6954752 however that is not to say dentist drills would become obsolete
6954753 i think there will always be those of us who like our sweets a bit too much and visit the dentist too infrequently to keep them in business
6954754 anything that means that there might be fewer filling materials used in the mouth is a tremendously positive development
6954755 i salute any technology that will scan the mouth and prevent cavities before they occur so we can try to have the least intervention in the mouth as possible

6954758 having irradiation of foods provides a disincentive for animal factories and other food production facilities to clean up their act

6954760 modern science has advanced since and this is an opportunity to apply modern science to evaluate these products
6954761 this is the beginning of getting drugs that are widely used in children in the over the counter world using the same modern approach weve started using for prescription drugs
6954762 this is how the agency can take these products off the market i think this signals the agency is going to apply a modern standard of safety and efficacy to these products and that is a standard these products cannot pass

6954770 mccain is loosey goosey and romney is buttoned down business romney tends to be programmed and mccain is anything but
6954771 if mccain asks romney to be his vice president it will be for the same reason john f kennedy asked lyndon johnson because he thinks he can win not because he loves him they dont have to hug they can have offices in different buildings
6954772 the youth and exhuberance of romney vs the tough hard bitten age of mccain probably plays to romneys advantage in terms of being selected
6954773 romneys got a mastery of the economy which is helpful because mccain by his own admission has less experience with that

6954780 a game needs element x or else it does not qualify as art
6954781 we ascribe beauty to that which is simple which has no superfluous parts which exactly answers its end which stands related to all things which is the mean of many extremes
6954782 science cannot go outside of the sphere of abstractions in this respect it is infinitely inferior to art which in its turn is peculiarly concerned also with general types and general situations but which incarnates them by an artifice of its own in forms which if they are not living in the sense of real life none the less excite in our imagination the memory and sentiment of life art in a certain sense individualizes the types and situations which it conceives by means of the individualities without flesh and bone and consequently permanent and immortal which it has the power to create it recalls to our minds the living real individualities which appear and disappear under our eyes art then is as it were the return of abstraction to life science on the contrary is the perpetual immolation of life fugitive temporary but real on the altar of eternal abstractions
6954783 the poets are almost always wrong about the facts thats because theyre not interested in the facts only the truth
6954784 poetry therefore is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history for poetry tends to express the universal history the particular by the universal i mean how a person of a certain type on occasion speak or act according to the law of probability or necessity and it is this universality at which poetry aim

6954787 this suggests that the game is really a form of indirect communication i may want to tell you about some truth of the human condition but if i say it in conscious or explicit terms it will sound too academic too intellectual and you wont hear me but if i wrap my message up inside a game and let you experience its manifestations rather than its intrinsic nature those manifestations can penetrate your consciousness and work their way down deeper where the true message can be induced from the instantiations and understood

6954811 one time in portugal when i lost a match against spain people waved the white handkerchiefs afterwards they said they wanted me out
6954812 they booed me many times as portugal manager and players sometimes what i try to do is give confidence to the player because people sometimes do not understand what is happening with the whole team
6954813 its not one player that makes a team it is 11 i think england have very good players and lampard is one of these players
6954814 i asked frank today are you sad he said no i said i know why you are sad because now you renewed your contract and you have money you have to think about how to spend it he laughed

6954832 we feel confident we know what the motive for the shooting was
6954833 the information was provided by the suspect during a conversation with an officer i can say it had nothing to do with nor do we believe there was anything involved that was related to gangs or racial motivations
6954834 thats all we can say there may have been a minor incident on the bus on the way to school that day we havent confirmed that
6954835 there is some limited video of the activities that took place at the school

6954845 becky clearly acknowledges that her gifts come from god she always seeks to use her gifts to glorify god and to also encourage the next generation i really admire her for that
6954846 the goal is to prevent the next generation from having the same issues of poverty and the trap that creates for young people dropping out of school limited opportunities unhealthy relationships and even commercial sex work as a survival strategy
6954847 were not only focusing on the spiritual needs of people were not only focusing on physical need were working on the whole person
6954848 but the things that they had survived were simply unimaginable to me
6954849 many of them were widowed had lost children and had become social pariahs in their communities because of their disease status but they were incredibly strong smart and so hopeful and positive they inspired me with their strength and gave me the motivation to do everything i could to help them become financially independent

6954918 but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe and he said to him friend how did you get in here without a wedding robe and he was speechless then the king said to the attendants bind him hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen

6954953 prices have hit the roof there is no sanity in the art market
6954954 i hope this summit will teach me how to make rational decisions i hear photography is the next big thing in new york i also want to know if sculpture is a wise investment
6954955 there is a new de centeredness that has come into play in the art world and it coincides with the so called rise of the rest which means vocalization of positions and perspectives that differ from the western position
6954956 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
6954957 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
6954958 theres not a shred of doubt about any of it
6954959 to state what should be obvious it is not the policy or practice of this agency to violate american law

6954961 consistently fought with some administration officials to prevent them from overstating the case for iraqi involvement in international terrorism
6954962 this isnt what the administration was expecting when they went into the process of negotiating these agreements
6954963 any successful politician in iraq is going to have to run as a nationalist
6954964 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground
6954965 the president said he never heard any democrats making the argument that
6954966 i am glad that the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6954967 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6954968 the fact of the matter is the iraqis demanded some timeline for our departure and the bush administration acceded to their demands
6954969 we should not forget that this is possible only because of the surge a strategy many predicted would fail and that some cannot even today recognize as a stunning success
6954970 if you believe as most iraqis do that theres been a heck of a lot of progress over here what is the next thing theyre going to say
6954971 when are these guys finally leaving so we can get on with our lives
6954972 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6954973 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6954974 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6954975 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
6954976 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

6954990 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6954991 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6954992 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6954993 they have a lot of fun and do a lot of things we dont condone in the u s
6954994 i never imagined we would win like that against a team like the united states
6954995 reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership
6954996 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes thats why when these games are completed we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs
6954997 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6954998 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6954999 i think you have to look at it in the totality of what theyve been able to do over the quadrennium in world championships and world cups and the games
6955000 when he came in as coach in 2005 he decided we werent going to settle for being maybe a contender he got the guys into good training facilities and good teams overseas he instilled a new philosophy of working hard and together with no superstars and picking each other up everyone bought into it
6955001 the sum of our parts is much greater than any individual this team is doing it the right way
6955002 winning or losing isnt going to affect how i feel about myself as a player but it sure as hell is going to be nice having a medal in the house
6955003 one of the reasons im here is because i know so many more lives are invested in this than just my own
6955004 given that responsibility and that im the leader of this team theres some accountability on my part to be here and do my job i wouldnt be here if i wasnt ready to give them everything ive got

6955025 public awareness campaigns which demonstrate the vital link between the equal representation and participation of women and men in decision making positions democracy good governance and citizen participation
6955026 it doesnt matter what kind of structure comes up what we are interested in are the principles that will better serve us as women including an open democracy and non violence
6955027 seriously consider changing the electoral laws for a system of proportional representation as the only electoral process that can safeguard the interests of women
6955028 when the internet first appeared this heated debate developed among economists
6955029 one side said the internet will make it easier for companies to price discriminate and itll be fabulously profitable the other side argued that the internet will be the great make markets close to perfectly competitive and people much more price sensitive and profits will be highly constrained im probably the leading guy associated with that second position arguably i got lucky but what i wrote basically turned out to be correct
6955030 if someone could have gone back and told people then how many phone lines would exist today in the u s theyd have responded that that was physically impossible because every american would need to be a telephone exchange operator that few switchboard operators exist today nevertheless isnt a sign that all those people are unemployed the labor economist alan krueger at princeton has studied what share of the highest paying occupations are occupation codes that didnt exist in the 1980 census the figure is very substantial theres always job churn

6955047 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6955048 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6955049 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6955050 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
6955051 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6955052 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6955053 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6955054 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6955055 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6955056 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6955057 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6955058 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6955059 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6955060 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6955061 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6955062 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6955063 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
6955064 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference

6955068 i also held discussions about homosexuality in islam and in the koran at first my friends were uncomfortable with my opinions and heated debates would often arise but in the end i managed to get the message across and they came to understand
6955069 just look at some bylaws in several regions they actually criminalize homosexuality

6955072 were a better team than this well get better were nowhere near panic
6955073 i thought we did a lot of good things as an offense but i made a couple of poor throws toward the end of the first half
6955074 we were able to come out and score at the beginning of the third quarter and that was a good way to end it
6955075 i think he played well and he handled himself well against a good defense

6955080 the guys at brumos racing did an amazing recovery from yesterday when we were really off the pace joe lajoie our engineer really put his head to the grindstone with the guys working on the car the car was really good in practice this morning and got even better in qualifying i think we have a good car for the race

6955083 lord please send somebody to teach me how to develop these gifts youve given me
6955084 theyre still calling even after the ad was taken down
6955085 its not just the prostitution its the crimes such as robberies and assaults that go along with this type of activity
6955086 purge apparent often graphic solicitations for prostitution rampant on certain sections of its web site
6955087 we have been engaged with craigslist in ongoing and constructive discussions working to develop ways to prevent and monitor ads like the ones in norwich for apparently illicit activity
6955088 merely adopting an interim ordinance after such a proposal does not mean that the ordinance is arbitrarily enacted to delay or prevent the proposed project
6955089 the court agrees with the city that the interim ordinance was validly enacted
6955090 if a court were to accept the citys argument municipalities would suddenly have carte blanche to stop any project for any reason or for no reason at all even where the project complies with the citys zoning code
6955091 preserving the status quo pending further study of zoning constitutes good faith
6955092 this is an opportunity to talk about some serious issues

6955100 how can i expect her to stay with me anymore
6955101 shes not going to want to be intimate with a freak elephant man thats the way i saw myself
6955102 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
6955103 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
6955104 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
6955105 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
6955106 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
6955107 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control

6955264 the players of the olympic national team deserved being summoned again
6955265 its a recognition and a prize for their dedication their behavior and their attitude during the preparation for the olympics and during the competition
6955266 i knew that i was up on the judges scorecards
6955267 i threw a cross to ndlovus stomach but it went below the belt
6955268 thats basically what i feel like that ryder cup is there a couple of weeks away when he makes that decision and im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible
6955269 i want to make that team and i want to be on there i think i could help that team i think i would be a good addition but its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too
6955270 i feel a little more pressure to tell you the truth coming into this week just because of that reason trying to make the team
6955271 like i say ive got two things going on at one time and im trying my best to separate them out
6955272 it would mean a lot whenever us players play and you play at a high level for a period of time that becomes a goal
6955273 its a goal with every u s player out here is to try to be part of that team even though it sounds like its nerve wracking and a tough week you want to be a part of it to experience that and to play for the country and to just take it all in and see what its all about
6955274 to be a part of a team i think is a huge thing
6955275 i didnt realize that until playing on last years team and it had been you know basically 11 years since i played on my first presidents cup team till last years team and its just a lot of fun
6955276 you get to joke around with the guys you get to understand them a little bit better you just get to know them a lot better and you miss that on a week to week basis
6955277 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
6955278 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
6955279 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
6955280 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
6955281 they can see from the olympics the achievements of 30 years of reform and opening up and the chinese peoples good spirit
6955282 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank

6955291 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics

6955293 not to be ungrateful but anybody watching beijing olympic tv could reasonably ask nbc what took you so long
6955294 whats good about nbcs coverage which is so far highly rated and acclaimed is that its another step in the long slog toward bringing common sense to olympic tv and gradually squeezing out elements of the olympic tv formula that long annoyed viewers
6955295 take the up close and personal features nbc uses to introduce viewers to largely unknown athletes now theyre usually concise and neatly tucked in event coverage
6955296 but they used to seem like mini movies that could leave viewers just tuning in wondering if they really had the channel showing the olympics it took nbcs stream of tear jerkers for the 1996 atlanta games how did john tesh manage to find so many athletes whose pets were gravely ill to turn the tide against these maudlin melodramas nbc sports chief dick ebersol joked sort of that theyd no longer portray asthma as a life threatening condition now nbc gives us glimpses of beijing rather than forced sightseeing travelogues became of olympic tv when abcs roone arledge invented the olympic tv formula in the 1960s when spanning the globe seemed exotic but by the time cnn gave us baghdad being bombed live in 1991 the novelty was gone still it was only after nbcs wandering travelogues albeit from fascinating australia for the 2000 sydney games that nbc cut back on forcing viewers back on the tour bus
6955297 kids today might assume there was always lots of live olympic action on various channels even if the best action is still held for all important prime time because the idea seems obvious
6955298 many people probably didnt know that all encompassing world tv coverage was being kept from them until nbc tried to sell it to them with its
6955299 the trickle of supplemental cable tv coverage nbc began with the 2000 games led to this years debut of nbc putting the world tv feed being available online something thats already happened in many other countries
6955300 after an irreverent cable tv skating show with dick button and mary carillo was a hit at the 2006 torino games nbcs beijing coverage has avoided being too earnest even showing host bob costas outdoors
6955301 so now nbc says theres no way that it will deviate from its routine of showing prime time olympic action on tape delay in the pacific and mountain time zones the regular formula it uses for entertainment shows even if michael phelps is swimming for his eighth gold medal in saturdays 4x100 medley relay thats just not how they do things when it comes to olympic tv finally making sense you need to be patient
6955302 i came to these games with stratospheric expectations and theyve been exceeded

6955304 this is a very history for us to try and come out like this and try and vote for the president of the united
6955305 we have wasted money because somebody in the school system didnt do their job
6955306 the olympic committees decision to create the new sponsorship category of official language training and testing supplier in 2007 and invite aifly to fill this role was one of the most important decisions in ensuring the success of the beijing olympics the training and testing services that aifly provided to olympic volunteers over the years leading up to the games were invaluable to our preparations
6955307 once we were asked to take on this role we determined that considering the limited time scale and complexity of the training program that was needed it would be most effective to focus on training volunteers in language and skills that they would be most likely to encounter and need to use effectively during the olympic and paralympic games
6955308 we use different training methods and focus on different content depending on the role and location that each volunteer will be assigned during the olympics so for example for medical aid volunteers we emphasized role playing and maintained small groups of between 4 and 10 students during training
6955309 last may i participated in the language training for college volunteers
6955310 ive been to six olympic games the beijing olympics is much better than i expected all the volunteers are very kind theyve given me a lot of help most of them can speak english fluently i did not expect their language skills to be so strong or to provide such professional service
6955311 what the fuck just because im chinese and you are speaking in that indo slang of yours doesnt mean i do not understand you
6955312 i looked at the phone in disbelief as he said you have cancer jade its real and its serious i collapsed to the floor thinking my boys oh my god im going to die

6955322 you cant win a game putting people on base its obviously been a problem all season long its just not a good thing to look at
6955323 right now his body is completely out in front of his arm his arm has to be quick and you lose control of your pitches
6955324 the first three starts i did well with it but i fell back into it today
6955325 i dont know if it was being tired the team got in from ottawa on friday morning at 5 30 or what
6955326 i think i tried to be a little too fine mccaffrey wasnt giving me anything low anything outside you end up trying to make perfect pitches start opening up forgetting about mechanics and just trying to throw it over the plate
6955327 they had a couple of hard hit balls but a few infield hits bloopers thats what happens when you cant get ahead i was behind pretty much everybody thats what happens
6955328 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6955329 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
6955330 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6955331 they seem to think our community is their open job site
6955332 it is their contention they are not required to do so its our contention that they are
6955333 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6955334 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6955335 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6955336 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6955337 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6955338 he got a little scared early on so we had to calm him down a bit
6955339 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6955340 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6955341 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6955342 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
6955343 it didnt get worse but at the same time hes not going to go back out there and resume what he was doing hes going to get treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him running around and catching grounders either its definitely a setback how far of a setback i just dont know
6955344 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6955345 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6955346 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6955347 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6955348 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6955349 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6955350 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6955351 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6955352 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6955353 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6955354 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6955355 wed even raise a glass to him that is if we could
6955356 theres a lot about rocket science thats been figured out but forests are subject to the intricate web of life the interactions of plants animals sun air you name it
6955357 they dont often think about their land and actively make plans for it because on a day to day basis it meets their needs
6955358 die spd muss sich berlegen ob sie die schwarze traurigkeit weiter an der macht h lt oder mich zum ministerpr sidenten w hlt
6955359 one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour
6955360 a political convention is not a place where you can come away with any trace of faith in human nature
6955361 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
6955362 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america
6955363 it is a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself and in that struggle for the soul of america clinton and clinton are on the other side and george bush is on our side

6955386 we were dead equal clint and i keselowski said after climbing from his car in the cloud of smoke from a just completed burnout
6955387 i needed to catch a break and he gave it to me
6955388 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake he said adding that he tried too quickly to get back on the gas coming out of the second turn
6955389 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
6955390 thats as bad of a points night as we could have edwards said
6955391 we just have to keep our heads up we know were good enough to go win this championship still
6955392 its been a frustrating two months for me bowyer said
6955393 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
6955394 this season weve really risen toward the top and we compete week in and week out with the best in the series
6955395 we do not doubt that criminal elements may be involved in seeking to subvert or corrupt some players or players support staff that may even involve organized criminal gangs but to elevate that suspicion to a claim of mafia involvement is in our view a distortion of the facts and is positively damaging to the sport the 66 page report said
6955396 any player caught cheating should be punished by a lengthy suspension for a first offense and if the circumstances merit it a life ban
6955397 i am very encouraged by the willingness of the sports governing bodies to take bold and proactive initiative in combating this threat to the game rees said
6955398 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
6955399 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
6955400 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6955401 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it
6955402 i knew what was going on i was falling behind in counts and not being aggressive
6955403 tonight i came out attacked the strike zone and got ahead
6955404 here lately his fastball has been up more and out of the strike zone but the good pitches that he made the ball sunk and he kept it low
6955405 i didnt pitch my greatest it was six innings of survival it was like boy scouts just making do with what i had
6955406 im looking forward to facing somebody other than joe inglett leading off the game
6955407 ill be excited that maybe lyle overbay wont be in the lineup and recognizes everything that comes out of my hand
6955408 i knew he was a good catcher but hes a great receiver
6955409 hes really good he blocks the ball better than i thought he did what he brings behind the plate a wealth of knowledge against the hitters is great ive enjoyed throwing to him i think weve gelled pretty quickly
6955410 the first day there was a little bit of uncertainty early because i wasnt sure how hitters react to him you use those first three of four innings to get a bit of a read today there was much more rhythm
6955411 i kept us in the game we were never out of it
6955412 we got the at bats we needed in the end
6955413 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good
6955414 if you can hold them to one run an inning its not as demoralizing to your team we were able to stay in and come back and win it
6955415 i was trying to be too perfect with it and i was far from it on that one
6955416 i think weve done our homework on him and faced him enough so that we have a pretty good idea how he pitches
6955417 what you have to do is make him throw it over the plate you cant chase it
6955418 the ones cabrera threw at the end might have had double hit me on them
6955419 ive only been here two games and things havent been good
6955420 i dont think you put too much stock on results but weve still got to regroup
6955421 my confidence comes from how the team feels and i think the team is really on a high right now
6955422 last week was kind of mixed emotions because of the conditions and the weather
6955423 we had several key mistakes so we were able to learn from that
6955424 its exciting to come out in the first half and move the ball like we did
6955425 all the feedback im getting is that harry will be fine
6955426 i thought i did some good things and i thought i made some mistakes
6955427 were a better team than this well get better were nowhere near panic
6955428 i thought we did a lot of good things as an offense but i made a couple of poor throws toward the end of the first half
6955429 we were able to come out and score at the beginning of the third quarter and that was a good way to end it
6955430 i think he played well and he handled himself well against a good defense
6955431 we have to buckle down and improve before we get into the regular season
6955432 we werent able to complete drives we need to score points
6955433 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
6955434 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
6955435 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
6955436 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
6955437 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
6955438 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
6955439 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
6955440 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
6955441 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
6955442 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
6955443 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
6955444 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
6955445 hes a regular guy when it comes to being a teammate
6955446 the thing ive gotten to learn about him is his work ethic is pretty impressive he knows hes a pretty special player hes gone about it impressively
6955447 we had a meeting with 25 players who felt like a team we havent felt like that for a week
6955448 evidently the boston thing was something he wanted to change
6955449 i had a great 12 years in new york managing the yankees it was time to go somewhere else
6955450 the guys have received me with open arms its been great
6955451 it feels like im on vacation im here for another month or two after this i dont know whats going to happen im living day by day
6955452 the clubhouse is a little looser were just having fun thats the way its supposed to be
6955453 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him what hes brought to the team
6955454 i was glad to just test it it was really good to just bust it down the line
6955455 schneider every year starts to turn it on at the end and thats key for us
6955456 i think what he did tonight that was different from pittsburgh was when he got 0 2 he went out of the strike zone so bad they could not swing at them and when he came back they fouled them off
6955457 youve got to get hits in key situations the clutch hits weve been scratching the last few days
6955458 might see more of that as long as were seeing more of those types of results
6955459 the airline is taking good care of this soldier heading home on leave
6955460 we are carrying the remains of cpl brock bucklin home he was killed in action in iraq and his twin brother brad is accompanying him back
6955461 the reality of that is etched in my mind forever
6955462 i was engrossed in looking out the window and when i turned back and saw what was happening i was angry and disappointed i knew then that we had to do something to first bond with those people that stayed on that airplane but maybe more importantly we had to reach the people who got off
6955463 because theres something very wrong when we cant spend 30 minutes of our life to honor the incredible sacrifices that these members of our military and their families are making
6955464 weve been able to give hundreds of scholarships to spouses
6955465 whether its getting secretarial skills or cosmetology school or some kind of vocation so they can get those skills and assume that role of bread winner and provide for their family financially
6955466 you wake up funny or you tweak it or whatever youve just got to let it calm down a little bit
6955467 hes much better today he told me that holmgren said
6955468 as i said the other day hes got to be ready to play the first game so
6955469 was go tell him last year that we were taking him out of the rotation
6955470 i had a feeling about him in spring training he was just throwing the ball great and was really really consistent
6955471 his sense of how to pitch is unbelievable and with his experience he knows how to get hitters out
6955472 he obviously doesnt have the power fastball like he used to anymore but hes still the same guy hes been for the last three years
6955473 he makes a living away he doesnt like pitching in and he makes you get yourself out
6955474 i know he has pitched against us at least twice maybe three times every time its been a little different
6955475 im not there every day to know why but i would have to say hes probably executed his pitches the way he wants to
6955476 i wasnt worried about how many games i was going to win
6955477 its still august so hopefully i can get a few more here before the seasons over
6955478 i kept us in the game we were never out of it
6955479 we got the at bats we needed in the end
6955480 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good
6955481 if you can hold them to one run an inning its not as demoralizing to your team we were able to stay in and come back and win it
6955482 i was trying to be too perfect with it and i was far from it on that one
6955483 i think weve done our homework on him and faced him enough so that we have a pretty good idea how he pitches
6955484 what you have to do is make him throw it over the plate you cant chase it
6955485 the ones cabrera threw at the end might have had double hit me on them
6955486 i thought i did some good things and i thought i made some mistakes
6955487 were a better team than this well get better were nowhere near panic
6955488 i thought we did a lot of good things as an offense but i made a couple of poor throws toward the end of the first half
6955489 we were able to come out and score at the beginning of the third quarter and that was a good way to end it
6955490 i think he played well and he handled himself well against a good defense
6955491 we have to buckle down and improve before we get into the regular season
6955492 we werent able to complete drives we need to score points
6955493 he is just small by todays standards he doesnt think he is small and that is half the battle
6955494 i dont have a good answer for you on that
6955495 most people said well hes a good coach but hes not a good gm but a lot went on and when the dust settled and everyone realized what happened i stayed and everyone left
6955496 theres new people in the front office new philosophies and i understand it they chose to do it a different way
6955497 but that stuff together and the promises i made to kathy his wife of 38 years all that stuff together and its probably time to call it a sabbatical leave a year off
6955498 when it comes to reading his own team wade phillips is barely literate
6955499 thats right i love the teaching part i just love it
6955500 thats the type of coach i am i wish i was more like tony dungy
6955501 its not an issue said firebirds senior center tyler roed
6955502 i would say he picks up 99 percent of everything
6955503 it wasnt an easy thing to do but i had very good positive reinforcement from my mom and dad zimmerman said
6955504 i know that im where im at now because of my speaking skills
6955505 what kid wouldnt look at that and say you know whatever ive got i need to work a little bit harder and i can overcome whatever problems i might have swiontek said
6955506 he certainly is a good example of overcoming a disability said blais who now coaches a united states hockey league team in fargo
6955507 he doesnt let it bother him at all he has always been genuinely enthusiastic
6955508 i gave him the responsibility of taking care of the defensemen and changing the defense as the games progressed sauer said
6955509 he just took charge and got his point across to the guys
6955510 they said thank you for making one of our childs dreams comes true bredahl said
6955511 he really played with his head on a swivel he had to said bredahl now a fargo attorney
6955512 big brother for each of the younger players to work with one on one
6955513 it will allow the older players to explain to the younger kids what they have to do to get at that level zimmerman said
6955514 we have to find ways to keep them motivated to play hockey thats not an easy thing to do
6955515 i never needed his help to make plates out of these greenskins heads
6955516 these new listings and upgrades show the close and continuing historical and social links that much of our heritage has to the history of slavery both in this country and from around the world
6955517 because i have been a nazirite set apart to god since birth if my head were shaved my strength would leave me and i would become as weak as any other man
6955518 cabaran dan kehidupan tidak boleh dipisahkan melainkan kematian mati itu lebih mulia dari hidup yang hina kedekut gelisah dan takut sama ertinya dengan kehidupan yang mati
6955519 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours
6955520 an expectation by financial market participants that financial crises will never occur would create its own form of moral hazard
6955521 and encourage behavior that would make financial crises more rather than less likely
6955522 no other industrial country has the central bank also doing prudential supervision
6955523 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6955524 investors are going to focus on the housing numbers and the financial sector
6955525 financials will remain in play and the anxiety over fannie mae and freddie mac will remain in the market place
6955526 its still possible that the government will nationalize fannie and freddie
6955527 nationalization will have a negative impact on the stock market as it will put tax payers on hook
6955528 not to find things that are meant to be found but things that arent meant to be found
6955529 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this once and for all
6955530 any reasonable person can conclude from seeing these snapshots that these documents once existed and were once on a government web server in china and are gone now
6955531 i have everything here to do it and it can be done in one push of action
6955532 were in a situation now that weve never been before hurricane frances was nothing
6955533 we cant flush our toilets weve got at least six feet of water back there
6955534 packing up thinking youre going to flood your house away
6955535 that retention pond is leaking whoever thinks they engineered that correctly is wrong
6955536 this tropical storm it hangs and hangs and it keeps upping this water up and throwing this and this is what happens
6955537 this is here to stay for a long time few days
6955538 but in the past ive got everything set on the watermark

6955543 wwe releasing referee wes adams was considered by many as being the victim of circumstances adams was the referee on ecw two weeks ago in the match between john morrison amp the miz vs mark henry amp matt hardy on august 12 that had a screwed up finish the plan was for miz to save morrison after a super side effect but miz missed his cue and morrison suffered a flash knockout from the bump morrison ended up trying to kick out at the last split second when he realized miz wasnt coming in to break up the pinfall adams still counted the pinfall and did his job as all wwe referees have been instructed to call every match as a shoot when he ruled the match was over things didnt look good on tv and you could tell everyone was confused many within wwe noted it wasnt adams fault as he was regarded as a nice guy and a scapegoat for this incident he is now taking on bookings as a wrestler on the indy scene
6955544 the god that threw me into the final after i failed to qualify will still throw up another surprise for me
6955545 blessing is a special athlete this is a great moment for me
6955546 this is something great for me it is a signal that something greater is coming in future i love sports sports is my life i really dont know what to say it is amazing it is the biggest miracle of my life going out in the qualifying coming back after and getting a medal is just the work of god when the message came that i would compete again came i knew that god was up for something for me glory is his name
6955547 great great feeling on a great day it is just two days away to the end of the olympics and we had been here for two weeks without a medal now we have two and you should imagine how it feels its marvelous
6955548 it was no magic we worked together prayed together and reviewed our race halimat had to come in for agnes who ran in the semifinal we were a little bit confused in that race but we worked on everything with our coaches and today our race was good and the baton exchange smooth its a happy day
6955549 most of the earlier studies including my own were based on economic factors which are something you can simply pull off a bookshelf and look up
6955550 if thats all you look at then thats all you find
6955551 the less threatened people feel the more tolerant they are
6955552 in the old days i would have told you to work hard and save your money
6955553 its different today i just havent nailed it down yet
6955554 the difference in a post 9 11 world is that the perception of threat isnt likely to ease just because u s troops are no longer actively engaged in iraq
6955555 the realization that the future is in traditional superpower conflicts the pre afghanistan environment and that hunting the taliban might just be a passing an even bigger potential sea change than the topline revenue issue
6955556 demand for records has grown but its kind of like the dandelion in the weed patch
6955557 digital audio systems are mere easy to use devices for people who have yet to discover the joy of live music it can be said that such systems are deflating music
6955558 when you hear a song you know that sounds better than youve ever heard before its addictive

6955560 wenn man sich den jahresverlauf ansieht war der olympiasieg nicht so berraschend berraschend war aber wie souver n und mental stark sie das rennen gewonnen hat sabine ist eine w rdige olympiasiegerin
6955561 unser publikum konnte die olympischen spiele intensiv miterleben packende bilder spannende reportagen gro e emotionen sachkundige analysen all dies hat das ard team frei haus geliefert eine olympiareife leistung

6955563 im gegensatz zu deutschland wo die rechteinhaber live von den spielen im netz berichten gibt es in den vereinigten staaten durch die sehr ung nstige zeitverschiebung oftmals nur aufzeichnungen bei nbc zu sehen
6955564 man hat beim organisations komitee fr hzeitig verstanden dass man die inhalte von beijing2008 cn in mehreren sprachen aufbereiten muss um m glichst viele user anzuziehen
6955565 die zugriffszahlen bei den live streams w ren ganz sicher noch h her wenn das ioc die rechte nicht jeweils l nderweise verkauft h tte und sich die sportinteressierten selbst h tten aussuchen k nnen auf welcher website sie nun olympia verfolgen
6955566 f r die rechte hat nbc viel geld bezahlt und will seine sendungen zu werbeg nstigen zeiten den zuschauern anbieten
6955567 es f llt mir zwar ein bisschen schwer diese zahlen glauben zu k nnen andererseits w rde mich eine derartige entwicklung nicht verwundern wenn der lpreis auf einem hnlich hohen niveau bleibt wie bisher in jedem fall w rde dies nat rlich eine gewaltige steigerung f r die biodiesel branche bedeuten
6955568 die biodiesel produzenten werden von allen seiten in die mangel genommen sei es von der politik den mineral lkonzernen oder der automobilbranche
6955569 die schwierigkeiten f r die biodiesel produzenten sind auch aufgrund der billig exporte etwa aus den usa immens
6955570 so sind die mineral lkonzerne in der lage die preise zu dr cken worunter die anbieter hierzulande stark leiden

6955587 hes got great ball skills he makes people miss he runs great routes in the backfield i dont think theres a huge dropoff when he goes in there and noel goes out
6955588 jock is more of a tailback who can run between the tackles even though hes so small of stature

6955593 i have seen the senseless tragedies that families and individuals go through and knowing that its preventable it just pains me and it hurts me
6955594 first and foremost we are held to a higher standard and i think rightly so we set the standard we set the model for the community and they follow our lead
6955595 some of the people in positions of power they have the knowledge of some of these things the law they have a better understanding of dui law and different things like that
6955596 dont go out there if you are going to drink just plan ahead and designate a driver
6955597 as a result within the last two weeks approximately 41 undocumented workers have been arrested by our agents on the island of maui and near that project of which 28 of them were confirmed as actually working at honua kai
6955598 since last december approximately 120 unauthorized aliens were taken into custody that related to work site enforcement operations
6955599 people are losing their jobs and its not in the hundreds but its in the thousands so these are available good decent citizens who want to make an honest living so they can support their families
6955600 that if you are illegally working here in the state or if you are knowingly hiring illegal aliens you better keep looking over your shoulders because we are coming
6955601 wenn man sich den jahresverlauf ansieht war der olympiasieg nicht so berraschend berraschend war aber wie souver n und mental stark sie das rennen gewonnen hat sabine ist eine w rdige olympiasiegerin
6955602 die bahnradien von paaren brauner zwerge sind oberhalb von etwa 15 astronomischen einheiten abgeschnitten
6955603 nach dem klassischen modell sollten sowohl braune zwerge als auch sterne aus interstellaren gaswolken entstehen die sich aufgrund ihrer masseanziehung zusammenballen
6955604 bei unserer untersuchung wird ein sprung in der masseverteilung sichtbar die die zweiteilung der stellaren population offensichtlich macht
6955605 is this a third world resort because if it is i need a third world hotel rate because i significantly overpaid

6955608 i think we need to upgrade it cause it looks kinda old
6955609 he comes and he says you know what lets do this and i was very surprised did not expect this at all were happy with just him paying for our meals
6955610 thats what its all about we want more kids doing stuff after school during school so we can service them and at the same time provide them goals high goals
6955611 we played well but let in a goal late in the first half and a couple towards the end of the game when we tired a bit
6955612 but despite those we had some good opportunities and i was fairly encouraged by how hard the team worked
6955613 we had a hard time attacking because they tech are very physical team in the second half when we started playing with the wind we did a good job of attacking and with our organization defensively we were able to press offensively as well
6955614 i am encouraged by the work ethic and determination to fight
6955615 we want results but we are young we only had two upperclassmen in the starting lineup so for us to come out and fight as well as we did against a more physical team thats a testament to the fight the kids are showing
6955616 i was taken this morning over an article in the fiji sun today and i had a talk with commodore teleni but everything is sorted now
6955617 see how early youd have to get up dressed fed and brushed if you went to public school so stop complaining when i ask you to get dressed already
6955618 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him what hes brought to the team
6955619 i was glad to just test it it was really good to just bust it down the line
6955620 schneider every year starts to turn it on at the end and thats key for us
6955621 i think what he did tonight that was different from pittsburgh was when he got 0 2 he went out of the strike zone so bad they could not swing at them and when he came back they fouled them off
6955622 youve got to get hits in key situations the clutch hits weve been scratching the last few days
6955623 might see more of that as long as were seeing more of those types of results
6955624 its exciting to come out in the first half and move the ball like we did
6955625 all the feeback im getting is that harry will be fine
6955626 if you were here winter wouldnt pass quite so slow and if you were here then id have a choice to live not be alone

6955630 we have senator hooser as a member of the credentials committee senator hanabusa is a member of the rules committee and lono lymon is a delegate and also on the platform committee
6955631 we want to try to get native hawaiians recognized in the national platform we have money to raise to make sure that our party can function locally and we also want our delegation to come back more unified than ever
6955632 this will be a great time for our 20 delegates 17 alternates and a good bunch of guests that were bringing along with us
6955633 its always an honor to speak at something like a national convention
6955634 i havent started to write anything yet but were in discussions with them now
6955635 the senator and his family have been tied to hawaii for a long time but what is more important are the positions the positions on the war on the economy on our culture
6955636 my mother died unneccesarily at the age of 89 a new heart could have allowed her to live another 20 years at least
6955637 this legislation would legalize the slaughter of innocent children for body parts
6955638 you have to look at who the senator from delaware is surrounding himself with criminal religious fanatics and foreign terrorist organizations
6955639 clearly he is being influenced by their anti longevity agenda
6955640 clearly jdesmond is under the influence of extremist views here ive convened a pannel of the theological and human actualization committee of the the american new catholic church to determine whether excommunication is warranted for senator thurber and his supporters in the meantime i have instructed all my bishopesses to deny communion to anyone publicly opposing this valuable legislation
6955641 the new catholic church georgetown university is run by the society of jesus in all of us a new catholic religious order clearly teaches that ensoulment or the infusing of a soul into a human being does not occur until the age of emancipation
6955642 my mom would still be alive if it had been legal to harvest a new heart from her clone this legislation is essential in our quest for longer life

6955736 human beings have still not been able to form a human society and have still not learned to move with the spirit of a pilgrim although many small groups motivated by self interest work together in particular situations not even a small fraction of their work is done with a broader social motive by strict definition shall we have to declare that each small family unit is a society in itself if going ahead in mutual adjustment only out of narrow self interest or momentary self seeking is called society then in such a society no provision can be made for the disabled the diseased or the helpless because in most cases nobody can benefit from them in any way in that case there always remains the possibility of some people getting isolated from the collective all human beings must attach themselves to others by the common bond of love and march forward hand in hand then only will i proclaim it a society

6955741 schools that serve minorities and the poor would be allowed to exist and their graduates would be allowed to take bar exams
6955742 because of accreditation policies designed to ensure continued and increasing economic and professional benefits for professors and deans the common man either will not gain admission to law school in the first place or will be saddled with so much debt upon graduation that a good chunk of his future will be a constant struggle
6955743 put and kept in place a system to obtain ever more tuition money and professional perquisites for law schools and law faculty with as little tuition monies as possible going to the undeserving university of which the school is but a part
6955744 the three groups have coordinated their activities there was vast and continuing overlap in their leaders with many of the same persons being leaders in either two or all three of the groups
6955745 the big three accomplished their mercenary purposes the losers were students that paid the bills through their soaring tuition minorities that were priced out of attending law schools and the public
6955746 into institutions that serve only the upper middle class and the upper class while knowingly largely keeping out minorities the lower middle class the poor immigrants and people in mid life they are intent on keeping the legal academy and the legal profession the preserve of the white and the wealthy
6955747 never permitted to take the bar or at best in about 15 or so states can take the bar only three five or 10 years after graduation
6955748 schools that serve minorities and the poor would be allowed to exist and their graduates would be allowed to take bar exams
6955749 more law schools that would look like the massachusetts school of law
6955750 schools built around this alternative model would produce capable lawyers at a much lower tuition which would be good for the students and good for society

6955752 unclear at this stage which side is more at fault for the current fighting
6955753 that the two countries have seemed to want war for some time
6955754 in georgia clash a lesson on us need for russia
6955755 in georgia and russia a perfect brew for a blowup
6955756 united states and its nato allies impose a price on russia
6955757 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
6955758 to respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
6955759 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

6955762 there is no point pretending that what is happening is not happening in the world economy that this unique combination of higher food and energy prices on the one hand and a sharp dislocation in the financial sector on the other is going to do anything other than make the next year a painful adjustment for the uk economy
6955763 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat
6955764 we will take the action necessary to see that it does

6955767 wpa sharp contractions in the money supply and recession are two spokes on the same wheel
6955768 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money
6955769 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
6955770 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
6955771 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
6955772 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
6955773 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
6955774 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
6955775 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
6955776 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
6955777 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933
6955778 the financial system has been turned over to a purely profiteering group the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money

6955780 i got the children used to not being afraid and i hope that it wont happen again i dont want to say that all of beit yatir is like that not everyone in the settlement is a thief and wicked its important to say that only a few and especially the one in the picture in recent months its become worse and theyve started to make a lot of trouble for us i feel it they try to steal sheep they try to run over sheep they throw stones at night and scare my children
6955781 i drive with the tractor to yata to bring water if the soldiers are nice they let me pass if not i have to travel three hours in the fields on a route that bypasses the checkpoint it all depends on the type of soldier at the checkpoint
6955782 we were born in caves and were used to a hard life we have no problem we became used to it already from our parents and i also force my children to become accustomed to our hard life only the settlers disrupt our lives they are destroying our lives we grew up with this we liked this situation we like to be with nature in difficult conditions except for the settlers who have inhabited our lands they have disrupted things all we want is to continue our lives thats all and we hope that the settlers will stop causing us problems theyre interrupting our lives
6955783 when i come to the police station they see me and close the gate i waste my entire day there if i go to file a complaint i need to spend an entire day in the sun thats what happened the last time i stood there tossed outside like a dog i push the buttons speak on the intercom they tell me ill be admitted right away and nothing happens
6955784 i had arrived there at 10 a m and it took me until 5 30 p m before i could file the complaint even when i had already done so i felt that the policemen were not receiving me properly and the investigator was not writing down what i said
6955785 they began to shoot those paint bombs at our children and our children got scared and fled
6955786 i wanted to approach to ask them why are you stealing our sheep but they are very fanatic people and they told me to leave the place immediately i didnt see bilal or the sheep where was bilal where were the sheep i was afraid i phoned the emergency number 100 they didnt answer it started to get dark were in the dark alone theyre cursing and shouting and im worried about my son and the sheep
6955787 i got the children used to not being afraid and i hope that it wont happen again i dont want to say that all of beit yatir is like that not everyone in the settlement is a thief and wicked its important to say that only a few and especially the one in the picture in recent months its become worse and theyve started to make a lot of trouble for us i feel it they try to steal sheep they try to run over sheep they throw stones at night and scare my children

6955978 we lose a game and all the sudden we are down the tank i dont know if its people waiting for us to fail or people dont just believe in the white sox
6955979 i keep in mind that its a long game and definitely with the offense that we have its not very often one or two runs is going to beat us it just gives me the peace of mind to be able to go out inning after inning and try to work in a groove
6955980 bushies a competitor he attacks and he competes on that mound when hes got his stuff going and hes executing you get what you see tonight
6955981 our starting pitchers theyve been giving us an opportunity to stay in the game
6955982 they really believe in themselves and what they are out to accomplish
6955983 you can see it its been different the last couple years you have seen them grow into a very good team with the same players every year other than being their opponent its been nice to see something we would want here
6955984 give up one or two in the first two innings and then get into mow down mode one right after another quick innings low pitch counts
6955985 good teams keep the pedal to the metal especially this time of year to everybody that they play
6955986 it doesnt matter theyre all the same theyre all capable of beating you every single night

6955988 para lo que crea conveniente en pos de sumar al reclamo pactado por las autoridades nacionales
6955989 ante las recientes versiones referente al incumplimiento de obras convenidas por el gobierno nacional para con nuestro distrito y entendiendo el retroceso que significa para la regi n la agrupaci n comunal transformadora queda a su disposici n para lo que crea conveniente en pos de sumar al reclamo pactado por las autoridades nacionales
6955990 la act fue testigo de la firma de convenios esperados desde hace tiempo ya que esas obran significan una mejora sustancial para el distrito
6955991 hoy vemos con desaz n que todo fue una simple promesa y nuestra comunidad result defraudada una vez m s
6955992 be wary be very very wary of the hidden hierarchy
6955993 for the one lot it is a fight to remain in positions and for the other it is a fight to get into those positions
6955994 his body lay on the street for a week it turned black we wanted to bury it but the russians wouldnt allow us
6955995 shamili lived alone his daughter was in tbilisi he just looked out and they killed him
6955996 people were scared we ran away ive been hiding in a field for the past 14 days
6955997 my relative dodo got a large piece of metal in the lung she was covered in blood we summoned an ambulance to take her to hospital but she died
6955998 they have taken dozens of new positions they are in control of the main entrances and exits of the city this is an occupation no doubt
6955999 they give different answers depending on how much vodka they have had to drink im serious
6956000 the bus was going to tbilisi the ossetians stopped it and took some people hostage others escaped
6956001 by far this is our most extreme dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date the legend of gilles de rais has been given fresh vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk swathed in pitch black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of cradle history screw what our detractors say everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram bejewelled floor
6956002 im reevaluating whether us airways is the program for me
6956003 i want to emphasize that i do appreciate there are thousands of employees and that they need to make a living
6956004 but the sense that im getting is that us airways is not in tune with a lot of their frequent fliers and perhaps management could be a little more responsive
6956005 el debate divide a la cgt y al pj porque a ellos los juntan los negocios a la cta el debate la fortalece porque tenemos principios s lidos somos antiimperialistas no creemos que el capitalismo sea la panacea del mundo y todos tenemos la convicci n de que hay que seguir acumulando fuerzas para que se discutan y resuelvan los temas que nosotros queremos y no los que el gobierno u otros sectores quieran
6956006 we are also worried about the security of our field staff
6956007 we know that there is a growing humanitarian crisis and we are prepared to support efforts to address this crisis but because of the continued ban we have had to put all our operations on hold there is a very real need to start supporting farmers with agricultural inputs and seeds that are in short supply for the next planting season
6956008 over the years communalarea farmers have concentrated their farming efforts by cultivating only their homestead plots and using manure if they have any cattle like the large fields of the formerly white owned farms that remain uncultivated they leave their larger fields untouched because it is of no use to cultivate the sandy soils without any fertiliser
6956009 we need to take the politics out of the day to day and term to term management of schools we need to strip ministers of their power to meddle and micro manage and give them a new strategic role and we need government to stop being so afraid of diversity
6956010 there is nothing wrong with different schools being different from one another in fact when the system encompasses difference schools can learn from others success and improve together in a way that is impossible when uniformity is imposed from above
6956011 the department for children schools and families would be halved in size
6956012 an educational standards authority would be a powerful body with independent oversight of exam standards with responsibility for schools inspection incorporating the existing ofsted and with responsibility for commissioning research on good educational practices and disseminating advice on best practice to schools
6956013 by scaling back some of the excessive national testing at key stages 1 and 3 in particular we will save millions of pounds and the money can be put directly into improving basic skills for those who presently fall behind from day one and never catch up
6956014 we all know what this mare can do shes a big strong mare but it seems at times she can be pretty difficult to drive mr dubois has done a great job with her at times ive seen her run for a step or two and hell get her back trotting needless to say i drove her like i was holding eggs on my lap
6956015 i plan less on having goals and more on wandering

6956019 id like to have that opportunity to make that decision ive been asked that question a lot the answer is i dont know
6956020 youd like to go in and play like the other night and maybe get some more plays and be as successful
6956021 but what if youre not do you keep trying to gain that success and in the process something bad happens i dont know i think its kind of a touchy situation based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6956022 sometimes we play them through the half and dont bring them out in third quarter
6956023 sometimes we bring them out in the third quarter i dont really have it set this year is a little bit different
6956024 its a bigger game for us in the preseason its a great test for us
6956025 we get to go against the world champions and see how we measure up and it will be fun
6956026 i dont know if you circle the date but its pretty much your last shot at getting some gametime readiness for that opener
6956027 lets get on the same page and kind of get that game 1 sense of whats going on lets approach it that way
6956028 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in the front seven
6956029 we feel like we are a pretty good group up front and its going to be a really good test guys are definitely looking forward to it
6956030 potential is definitely a scary word but i feel like we have the ingredients to be really good up front the whole key is we just have to continue to work at it
6956031 as you know the offensive line is really the one position that takes longer to jell than any other position on the football team but we have a bunch of hard working guys
6956032 they do a lot of stuff in terms of their zone blitz packages
6956033 the types of zone blitz are not all just the post safety zone blitzes theres some split safety cover 2 theres some split safety cover 4 there are multiple looks and ways that they pressure and then when they just bring the four down guys they can cause problems too
6956034 i keep saying it but when guys can communicate without communicating up front its really big and its really when you start to do things beyond xs and os
6956035 you start to be able to pick up the tough blitzes and the tough looks the defenses give you and not just make it a wash youre able to still take advantage of it as if you drew it up that way
6956036 im struck by the fact that as i travel around the world how many people in these countries even people we consider illiterate question their government they assume their government is corrupt they assume ours is corrupt but we dont it is amazing to me how many of us dont at least not openly the fact is that americans for the most part dont really want to know whats going on but we need to we really need to question that
6956037 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
6956038 we are thrilled at this outstanding recognition by peer institutions of our remarkable progress in creating a culture of innovation across our campus
6956039 as pioneers in technology and higher education we continue to explore innovative learning technologies to apply in the classroom and enhance the overall learning experience
6956040 our new mobile learning initiative continues to make news around the world it is a great example of the distinctive and innovative programs we seek to develop in response to acus 21st century vision
6956041 we want to be known as the premier university for the education of christ centered global leaders and it pleases me to see others noticing our success stories
6956042 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
6956043 we gave the game away we just gave the game away
6956044 at that time weve just got to learn how to play football there were certain situations where we should have just laid on the ball but they fought tonight
6956045 hes a sophomore and youre going to have some sophomore mistakes
6956046 this is my 25th year as a head coach and first games are always the same
6956047 there are many mistakes and you just try to get through them with the least amount of errors they turned the ball over and we didnt and i believe that is the difference in the ball game
6956048 they played real well well enough where we should have won the game
6956049 its obviously good to get off to a 1 0 start and the kids deserve it
6956050 im proud of the fact that after a sluggish first half we kept our composure came out in the second half and began to execute on both sides of the football
6956051 they gave us the opportunity and we finally put things together on offense the offensive line blocked we made some catches basically we just started making plays
6956052 it was a team effort it takes 22 guys to win a football game not one or two
6956053 we stuck to our game plan we knew what they were going to do everybody just did their job and executed
6956054 were going to enjoy tonight but weve got to get back to work tomorrow
6956055 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
6956056 yeah hannahs in love with this guy from the army and theyre gonna date when he gets back in april
6956057 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
6956058 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
6956059 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
6956060 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
6956061 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
6956062 because of the unreasonable media criticism on this issue it has definitely effected our olympic preparations
6956063 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence and work with the federation to 100 percent clarify this situation and put this to rest and thats whats in the process of being done
6956064 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6956065 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6956066 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6956067 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6956068 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6956069 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6956070 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6956071 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
6956072 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
6956073 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
6956074 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
6956075 i have found it easier to identify with the characters who verge upon hysteria who were frightened of life who were desperate to reach out to another person but these seemingly fragile people are the strong people really
6956076 it would probably be difficult to find any american psychiatrist working with the mentally ill who has not at a minimum exaggerated the dangerousness of a mentally ill persons behavior to obtain a judicial order for commitment

6956087 wholesale price index based inflation continues to be a matter of concern but without underplaying the seriousness of the concern we wish to place the matter in perspective
6956088 the annual point to point inflation is largely influenced by the trend in the corresponding week of the previous year which is the base year
6956089 when matters are related to the emotions of the people we should try to solve them as quickly as possible i think we will be able to solve this matter in a very short time
6956090 that is exactly what we are trying to do and we would like to accept a formula which is acceptable to both people living in jammu and the people in kashmir
6956091 even with the additional conditions and restrictions that were proposed an india specific exemption from nsg rules would be a serious mistake that would blow a hole in the nuclear nonproliferation system
6956092 at this point we can expect that washington and new delhi will try to wordsmith the proposals to restrict and condition nuclear trade with india to the point of being meaningless and force a decision at the next nsg meeting
6956093 in response responsible nsg states should insist on guidelines relating to india that are clear and unambiguous and given that the nsg participant states actions on this issue will have an impact for decades to come they should not rush to judgement

6956101 the dalai lama identified spirituality as having the qualities of the human spirit love compassion forgiveness and a deep sense of responsibility
6956102 its important to practice these virtues and gain some wisdom

6956104 we hope to raise awareness amongst the very people that need to see our message maybe some of these men have never drawn a link between hardcore pornography and sexual violence
6956105 the current law is far too liberal and vague and needs to be amended
6956106 it is time that the rights of families to not be exposed to offensive material are put before the rights of the pornography industry to promote themselves
6956107 cbd business association heart of the city recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its big little city marketing campaign however the only advertising queen street is getting at the moment is around a tacky parade potentially its so damaging it could almost be viewed as a form of economic sabotage inflicted by one man for his gain only

6956139 iklan secara hukumnya akan memperkuat dasar kalau masyarakat melihat bahwa politisi itu tidak memenuhi janji sesuai iklannya mereka masyarakat bisa melakukan class action untuk menuntut janji iklan ini bisa jadi bukti hukum ada caleg janji tidak dipenuhi class action saja
6956140 saya sepakat jika masyarakat lebih peduli melihat iklan iklan politik yang ada dan melakukan upaya hukum jika para politisi ini ingkar ini mungkin menjadi penjelasan kenapa politisi kita tidak mau bicara detil dalam iklannya mereka cuma bicara normatif misalnya bersama kita bisa akan meningkatkan perekonomian mungkin karena takut dapat class action
6956141 karena pasti akan timbul pertanyaan masyarakat darimana sumber pendanaan iklan politik biasanya dari kantong pribadi idealnya pendanaan kampanye datangnya banyak dari publik misalnya obama awalnya iklan sangat terbatas karena dia tidak punya dana banyak tapi karena dia punya modal sosial tinggi jadi timbul simpati

6956154 i told him the first time we ran that play that i had an opportunity to run past the guy
6956155 he came back into the huddle and told me go deep
6956156 i trust him to put the ball where its supposed to be
6956157 its just working together i understand where hes going to be he understands what im looking for we put a lot of work in this offseason just him and me on the field the smallest questions you can ask him if youre wide open where do you want the ball up around your shoulders in your stomach just little things like that and i think its paid off so far
6956158 i want to play 16 games this year holmes said
6956159 thats my biggest goal this year and the numbers and the yards will speak for themselves
6956160 i get a little bit more run responsibility because most people run to the tight end
6956161 the more you can do the more you can contribute in any shape or form the more you have a chance to make this ballclub
6956162 youre more like the commander back there the quarterback of the defense it gives you an opportunity to lay a hat on people
6956163 you do all those otas why not cut back on the preseason games
6956164 either cut back on the preseason games or cut back on otas
6956165 but really theyre mandatory you can say its voluntary if you want but it doesnt look good when youre not here so many big people make a big deal if a guys not here if you make such a big deal about it its voluntary it should be every guys choice if he wants to come back
6956166 yeah but if troy casey myself ben willie all stay away now it becomes a problem
6956167 to me its mandatory the preseason starts in april or may and goes all the way to now now it gets kind of monotonous you see the same old plays you run the same offense i get tired going against deshea ive been going against deshea for 11 years from may on out
6956168 when i was a rookie we had a rookie minicamp and a smaller minicamp you didnt see the veteran guys until the first week of june for a four five day camp thats the way it used to be
6956169 he said their coach beat them up in training camp and by time they got to the season in the fourth quarters they were beat up physically and mentally drained
6956170 camp was good he didnt really cut back but some of the veteran guys he let off some days hes been looking out for i guess those 30 and above its the same football myself potsie james farrior james harrison deshea weve been running the same plays since day one theres no need to grind through it weve been in this league so long i think we know what it takes to be mentally tough its the young guys those are the guys he really pushes
6956171 its probably the best preparation were going to get before the regular season you want to get the guys going on a 10 or 12 play drive if i have my clothes on im ready to play i dont want to come out of the game but you have to be smart about it
6956172 charlies a quality backup who has been around that could easily have been me or ben or anybody who plays a vital role on this team
6956173 if two starting guys get hurt on your team that can cause a different outcome for your season imagine if we lose ben or troy in the preseason the state of the steelers probably would go a little crazy so you have to be smart in situations you do have to take precautions you dont want to overwork your guys in games that dont really count
6956174 gerald called in sick i have to run over and ta the class for him

6956180 the government accepts that our policies must evolve to remain relevant in the current media landscape it is no longer realistic to disallow all forms of party political films
6956181 we think films which are factual documentaries or recordings of live events held in ought to be allowed such films are less likely to turn politics into an emotional and irrational debate with all the dangerous consequences

6956206 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6956207 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6956208 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry
6956209 we believe that this company plans to sell the sydney site and it is about trying to increase the sale price of that site by transferring contracts there
6956210 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6956211 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6956212 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6956213 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6956214 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6956215 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6956216 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6956217 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6956218 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6956219 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6956220 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6956221 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6956222 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6956223 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6956224 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
6956225 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6956226 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6956227 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6956228 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6956229 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6956230 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6956231 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6956232 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6956233 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6956234 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6956235 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6956236 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6956237 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6956238 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6956239 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6956240 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6956241 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6956242 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6956243 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6956244 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6956245 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6956246 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6956247 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6956248 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6956249 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6956250 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6956251 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6956252 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6956253 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6956254 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6956255 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6956256 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6956257 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6956258 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6956259 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6956260 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6956261 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6956262 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6956263 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6956264 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6956265 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6956266 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6956267 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6956268 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6956269 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6956270 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6956271 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6956272 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6956273 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6956274 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6956275 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6956276 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6956277 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
6956278 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto

6956281 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6956282 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6956283 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6956284 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6956285 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6956286 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6956287 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

6956295 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6956296 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6956297 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6956298 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6956302 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6956303 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6956306 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6956307 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6956308 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6956309 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6956310 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6956313 everybody should be able to afford health insurance whatever their income and i have a pretty good income i just cant afford it
6956314 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6956315 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6956316 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6956317 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6956318 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6956319 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6956320 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6956321 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6956322 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6956323 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6956324 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6956325 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6956326 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6956327 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6956328 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6956329 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6956330 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6956331 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6956332 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6956333 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6956334 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6956335 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6956336 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6956337 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6956338 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6956339 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6956340 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6956341 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6956342 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6956343 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6956344 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6956345 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6956346 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6956347 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6956348 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6956349 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6956350 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6956351 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6956352 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6956353 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6956354 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6956355 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6956356 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6956357 then i met mike abbott at a main street illinois meeting in southern illinois
6956358 we got to talking about the balloon festival in lincoln and the next year mike invited me well he sponsored me and my balloon
6956359 its expensive to put on and its pretty expensive for us
6956360 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6956361 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6956362 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6956363 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6956364 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6956365 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6956366 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6956367 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6956368 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6956369 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6956370 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6956371 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6956372 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6956373 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6956374 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6956375 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6956376 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6956377 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6956378 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6956379 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6956380 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6956381 i am young and unknown to many of you i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life
6956382 when you think of an african american presidential candidate it closes the loop that lincoln opened which was about human equality about the worthiness of every person
6956383 there are multiple reasons why sen obama chooses a lincoln site including covering for his short time in illinois trying to show people who are leery that he has midwestern values and trying to draw a parallel on experience between he and lincoln since both made a gigantic quick step toward the presidency
6956384 a presidential race is to a great extent about symbolism
6956385 barack obama has demonstrated he has the ability to evoke potent and powerful symbols about the highest office that anyone can achieve in the united states
6956386 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6956387 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6956388 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6956389 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6956390 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6956391 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6956392 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
6956393 gt pilot al reusch of macomb attempted to get his balloon in the air but only got it halfway up before he had to bring it back down because of high winds
6956394 it looks like we have a chance to get one in
6956395 it just so happened i read the route downfield was able to undercut it and made a play on the ball
6956396 we dont play them in the regular season so this is going to be like a real big game i expect a lot of people to be there
6956397 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
6956398 i think what happened today is encouraging but unacceptable until the last russian soldier leaves my country
6956399 what they are still doing making explosions camping by the road digging positions does not look to me like cease fire it looks like warfare
6956400 we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6956401 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territories and they need to do it
6956402 they go to these companies and they say we want you to give us this money
6956403 connect with influential government officials such as cabinet members the president next president
6956404 yes hes telling them he expects the fortune 500 companies to give at least half a million to a million
6956405 the first thing well do is form a committee to run the search for a new chief
6956406 it will be a three person committee and theyll review the applications resumes schedule interview and make a recommendation
6956407 we advertise in house first and that has to be done for three days
6956408 then theyll review the in house applicants and if there is not anyone they want to interview there then we can go outside and advertise elsewhere but we always post in house first
6956409 i certainly enjoy law enforcement ive been doing it for almost 24 years
6956410 i love the city of seneca and i appreciate the opportunity to apply my knowledge and experience to help the people of this city i think im fully capable of fulfilling the duties required of this job ive been doing it since april
6956411 its been a stressful situation for all of us in the department
6956412 there was so much uncertainty about what was going to happen with the departments leadership but weve all been looking forward to getting a little closure to the matter
6956413 while that is solely dans decision im sure that after due diligence with the committees recommendation a decision will be made rather quickly
6956414 i dont know if that is going to happen or not
6956415 were not at that crossroads yet council will make that decision i can tell you they are very concerned about stanley and his family but i really dont know if that will happen or not i wish i could look into my crystal ball and tell you what theyre going to do if theyll offer anything at all well cross that bridge when we get there

6956428 the management of the dump will be handed over to the tender winner of the bantar gebang expansion project
6956429 were looking for a company that can process 6 000 tons of garbage per day with a tipping fee of rp 103 000
6956430 for example the contract says that bekasi will get a tipping fee of between rp 95 000 and rp 103 500 per ton of garbage however bekasi administration said that they only received rp 60 000 per ton
6956431 we cant raise the fee immediately because the jakarta administration is currently being reviewed by the supreme audit agency and corruption eradication commission therefore we have to go through the tender process
6956432 the jakarta administration now reuses the long untapped sites this is dangerous because we cant control the dump height the garbage should only stand 20 meters high

6956439 qu habr amos hecho en este punto si estuvi ramos en 1985
6956440 i think i add an extra dynamic to the team with my leg strength
6956441 but i still have a long way to go before the final cuts
6956442 thats a weapon if you can put it out of the end zone so you give the other team the ball on minus 20
6956443 well continue to evaluate that but hes looked very strong in camp
6956444 we have a guy like john who is moving on in the years and im sure he will love me for saying that but i think its helping him too
6956445 its saving his leg hes one of the best kickers around if its helping out the team thats a good thing
6956446 i was just fooling around i never had any intention of playing football
6956447 i felt like if i wanted to make a career out of being an athlete the nfl was the better route to take in america just because its a higher profile sport than soccer is over here
6956448 soccer isnt really much of a money maker and the mls struggles from time to time so me and my dad sat down and we just felt like it was the best decision it pursuing a professional soccer career was the hardest decision i had to make it was hard to let go
6956449 i feel like im a kicker as much as john is
6956450 thats not saying im going to take over johns job in the next week or two because that is not reality the reality is im here to do a job handling the kickoffs and anything else they need me to do
6956451 its time to enjoy our moment we played a really bad game against the u s you know but now we learn a lot from that experience and we want to try to win the finals
6956452 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
6956453 weve got to play better than what we did tonight
6956454 im not saying we played bad but we did want to be better than we were tonight
6956455 and i havent changed it yet im going to try and do my best to change it this year
6956456 we started off hot last year and people jumped on the bandwagon
6956457 i thought there was determination and i thought there was enthusiasm
6956458 guys like that dont accept mediocrity nowhere in our discussions have i sensed any resignation or any kind of doubt hes fully determined
6956459 we got hope if we can play smart and play with a little more effort and get a few more loose balls those kind of things
6956460 there is a common worldly kind of christianity in this day which many have and think they have enough a cheap christianity which offends nobody and requires no sacrifice which cost nothing and is worth nothing
6956461 its not the peak horsepower number that really matter its the power range
6956462 we have access to soft wall technology but soft wall technology only works if we put it up every other race track i believe except for maybe sonoma has soft walls and its time for watkins glen to follow suit the technology doesnt help us if its not up
6956463 if that part of the outside wall had been a soft wall
6956464 so its time for that track to install a soft wall right there
6956465 now i dont like to speculate but there was a huge rebound effect and we have access to safer technology and we should implement it
6956466 gives us the best opportunity to win the football game
6956467 as ive said from the beginning the decision would be made on who we feel gives us the best opportunity to win the football game and right now we feel russell wilson will do that
6956468 he will be our starter as we go but we certainly feel that daniel evans has some things he can contribute to this football team as well russell is the starter and daniel is the backup but as daniel knows he is one play away from being the starter
6956469 i believe daniel and i can both step in and help this team win some games the team is really excited to go down to south carolina and we hope it will be a great game
6956470 im very excited about the opportunity to play on thursday
6956471 i know russell is going to do a great job hopefully we can both help the team go down and compete against the gamecocks
6956472 we had guys running wide open in the secondary we had missed assignments missed tackles theres a lot of stuff we need to work on
6956473 but turnovers kept us out of the end zone all night we did some good things
6956474 you need to give high point central a lot of credit theyre a good team with a lot of talent and athleticism
6956475 we knew with the speed they the bobcats have that if we could keep it close wed have a chance

6956480 hemos estado muy descontentos con la reacci n de la compa a en los primeros momentos reconoci no solamente el gobierno de canarias sino que tambi n el presidente del gobierno me ha trasladado que la compa a no estuvo a la altura
6956481 fue lo que pas en una parte de san andr s donde no se dej aparcar m s y los comercios se murieron
6956482 me parece bien que en federico tapia saquen el aparcamiento de un lado pero aqu en juan fl rez no porque los clientes no tienen donde aparcar para dejar y recoger los encargos
6956483 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6956484 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better today it could be better on sunday
6956485 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6956486 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6956487 thats what i have worked for to get where i am now i am not where i want to be but i am where i need to be to move forward this is the next big test
6956488 el gobierno local quiere poner a la ciudadan a en contra de la polic a local para justificar el expediente administrativo que ha iniciado
6956489 en ese momento la edad penal estaba en 16 a os
6956490 por lo que no se le puede atribuir actuaciones de tiempos anteriores
6956491 this is really the first place i ever really felt wanted and coming back and doing this is just special
6956492 ive told the team that its all about the little things
6956493 i thought we did some good things on defense i was very proud of them our defensive coordinator mark hoover and our defensive staff did a great job
6956494 weve got some things we need to shore up but i was pleased with what i saw out of everyone tonight
6956495 constataci n de que psoe y bng son incapaces de entenderse

6956499 i like our odds were 50 percent right now over here we have four people playing two bulldogs
6956500 adams playing really well and if i can get by danny lee its going to get interesting
6956501 its fun to have your football team win but it would be really cool to have a georgia bulldog win the u s am
6956502 i started hitting my irons a little better had chances to make birdie putts and kept having to make him beat me with birdie putts rather than always having to scramble to get up and down
6956503 maybe ive just got to keep playing well and dont play those holes
6956504 no va a haber ning n movimiento ni se est mirando
6956505 estamos contentos tranquilos y sin agobios barrag n enseguida se recuperar y laure est en un muy buen momento adem s a manuel creo que lo vamos a tener ah en mes y medio largo o corto pero aproximadamente se es el plazo
6956506 diversos factores entre los que se encuentran la geolog a de la cuenca del eume
6956507 something goofy always seems to happen when you go into extra innings
6956508 it appeared to be a pitchout and he hits it and it short hops the wall so i guess that figures our nonexistent offense was there for most of the night we did have some guys with some scoring opportunities but we didnt capitalize and they pitched a whale of a ballgame
6956509 the season does seem kind of long but when you are in this kind of playoff atmosphere you really just focus on what you need to do to win
6956510 you catch it at the right time and we went 6 1 on the road and we were terrible on the road in the first half
6956511 but you see things starting to build like a snow ball and it just keeps rolling
6956512 i just saw something close and hit it and it was good enough
6956513 we are just trying to win games and make the playoffs and hopefully bring another championship to this stadium
6956514 most of us have been together now for 100 something games so you get to know each other and its just clicking right now
6956515 i know a lot of people are here for different reasons but its great to have a fan base here like this
6956516 we are in the hunt and they are closing out this ballpark and moving to the next one so everybody is excited about that
6956517 its fun to be in a pennant race and its fun to see the guys excited about showing up for work

6956538 el crunia es un nuevo formato que sustituye al escenario m vil que formaba parte de la programaci n del r a marineda
6956539 me gustan mucho todos los grupos pero si hay que destacar algunos conciertos son los de meu y the majestics que son dos bandas con discos en el mercado y que tienen mucho trabajo y reconocimiento
6956540 la habitaci n roja son un referente en la m sica pop rock de este pa s porretas es una leyenda el rock urbano y el gran descubrimiento para el p blico puede ser el cantautor leon s fabi n su espect culo es magn fico lleno de sensibilidad y creo que puede ser uno de los m s aclamados por la gente que acuda a los conciertos
6956541 un precedente muy bueno para los m sicos de la ciudad
6956542 los miembros del grupo siempre hemos sido muy independientes a la hora de gestionar nuestras actuaciones
6956543 el crunia es una buena oportunidad para tocar y reunir a bandas muy distintas
6956544 hablamos sobre nuestras cosas y preparamos un poco el concierto del festival porque yo toco antes que l
6956545 fue muy especial pero este a o va a ser muy distinto porque esto es un festival y hay m s medios que entonces
6956546 est todo un poco espeso pero en a coru a al ser pocos los cantautores nos organizamos muy bien para hacer cosas y tocar bastante
6956547 el festival crunia es una demostraci n de que las cosas se pueden hacer bien
6956548 el festival crunia es una demostraci n de que las cosas se pueden hacer bien afirma el l der de la banda

6956556 es muy importante para los m sicos de la ciudad porque el ayuntamiento puede ver que con poco dinero se pueden hacer cosas
6956557 lo bueno ser a que este tipo de propuestas no se hicieran s lo durante el verano
6956558 lo nico que no nos gusta del festival es que haya cabezas de cartel que toquen m s tiempo
6956559 vamos a estar cuatro d as en a coru a despu s vamos a ir a oviedo y si nos da tiempo a san sebasti n
6956560 preferimos venir en autom vil porque nos da m s autonom a y no tenemos que depender de venir en avi n y luego tener que alquilar un autom vil

6956589 if future generations are to maintain their freedom those of us who know something of our history and the price paid for our freedom must pass it on to the next generations sadly many students today are not receiving sufficient factual history to prepare them to function as responsible citizens
6956590 i was determined to see how they all looked as they signed what might be their death warrant i placed myself beside the secretary charles thomson and eyed each closely as he affixed his name to the document undaunted resolution was displayed in every countenance
6956591 for the support of this declaration with the firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor
6956592 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6956593 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6956594 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6956595 meaningfully engage in legal forums with those who sponsor or enable the rallies
6956596 conducting traffic checkpoints that look at more than just whether drivers have been drinking checkpoint officers would look for motorcycle noise violations equipment violations registration and operating licenses and use drug sniffing dogs to find other violations impounding all offending vehicles
6956597 by yael t abouhalkah kansas city star editorial page columnist
6956598 i rode bikes with him and i saw him at all saints when he worked at all saints and at new leaf when he worked at new leaf
6956599 he was very sensitive and thoughtful and lived a very intentional ethical life
6956600 the last thing he would want would be for his accident to trigger people not to ride their bikes
6956601 well probably be doing a lot of memorial stuff for him probably in the next week
6956602 it all sort of rotates around our neighborhood here the commercial bike shops and krank it up and all saints theyre the center of the bike community here in tallahassee
6956603 it appears that the bicyclist at some point was struck by the semi but the details are still under investigation
6956604 and well have to evaluate the witness statements and physical evidence in order to make a determination on what if any charges would be filed
6956605 i think its going to be pretty evident that the officer was fearful of his safety and life and thats why he had to fire
6956606 all the same the indications are that somebody was totally jumped and beaten if thats what the investigation says they have a right to defend themselves
6956607 our job isnt to interfere with the investigation but to gather information for our internal purposes
6956608 one of the reasons for that federal law is that police officers unlike anyone else are almost on duty all the time
6956609 you never know when you might run into someone who you arrested
6956610 had the officer not said a word it would never have happened
6956611 are supposed to keep the peace not rile up the crowd
6956612 the decision to fire is up to each individual officer only you know when you feel the time is right and your life is in danger
6956613 its a traumatic incident any time someone has to fire a handgun
6956614 if our honor and respect for those who serve and die for us overseas consist only of wearing flag lapel pins or patches and waving flags on special occasions yet we do little to nothing to insure that the ideals they have fought and died for are secured on the home front are we honoring or dishonoring them
6956615 those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are people who want crops without ploughing the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the roar of its many waters the struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never has and it never will
6956616 insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
6956617 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
6956618 for revealing iranian presidents overpriced dogs that his security team uses
6956619 for posting his vocal critiques of human rights abuses and environmental degradation in china and calling the olympics a human rights disaster
6956620 for revealing iranian presidents overpriced dogs that his security team uses
6956621 for posting pictures of monks and people demonstrating on the streets
6956622 this means i am now going to have to kill and eat lopez cantera
6956623 given the magnitude complexity and number of out of state witnesses in this case this was the only logical venue for the next step in the process
6956624 i think its going to be pretty evident that the officer was fearful of his safety and life and thats why he had to fire
6956625 two or three angels going to be with their buddy
6956626 they are aware of the rules in the e r were not expecting more but you never know
6956627 in the years we have been doing this we have almost no trouble during the rally
6956628 ive been around animals my whole life and never had an incident
6956629 senior management has been talking with a wide array of possible investors this week
6956630 for many years ms loftlands inappropriate behavior has gone unchecked
6956631 has been an ongoing problem for a very long time
6956632 oh hell the shit is going to hit the fan and we best start covering our asses
6956633 by the time i was 10 years old i was so trained id wake up in the morning put ankle weights on and run hills
6956634 dad and i would go down to the park and get after it
6956635 he taught me to push through things not make excuses over time ive had a lot of coaches and a lot of strong men in my life to reinforce that
6956636 you worry less about whether or not they believe it
6956637 more what i think about and what most guys think about is improving your play and making yourself valuable to the point it cant be denied
6956638 lewis is pretty good and those other guys behind him are not as good
6956639 we know what jason wright is he works extremely hard hes going to be where hes supposed to be hes going to do what hes supposed to do
6956640 a size speed combination thats rare a lot more experience a 2 000 yard season a super bowl ring
6956641 i like to think our teammates would be confident in both me and jerome not just me
6956642 i think that we would be able to hold the fort
6956643 we went to school in chicago we love cleveland because moreso than in some other parts of the country people are down to earth
6956644 with us theres not a lot of pretense pomp and show we are who we are we say what we mean
6956645 a broken water pipe flooded the main building of library and archives canada in ottawa early tuesday morning closing the building and causing a small amount of damage to some books
6956646 we moved the ball effectively and did what we set out to do
6956647 cody showed a lot of poise and was very aggressive
6956648 it wasnt pretty out there but well take it and hopefully learn from it
6956649 we self destructed a lot tonight but somehow made enough plays to secure the victory we would follow a couple of bad plays with some good ones we will need to be more consistent next week against solon if we hope to be successful
6956650 you cant put the ball on the ground against a good team like jackson and expect to win
6956651 however i am extremely proud of my kids they gave a great effort tonight the wins and losses will come and go but the effort these kids gave was tremendous and something we can hopefully build on
6956652 its nice for the offense but it means the defense has to get back out there pretty quick
6956653 but well take it anyway we can get it our kids had a lot of fight in them and gave a great effort we didnt do everything perfect but they never quit and thats what i like
6956654 it was such a short kick that caleb was past the second wall when he caught it so he had a great jump on the ball and his motor was already running then he just made one guy miss and that was it
6956655 its a great debut for him but its a great credit to our offensive line and the guys carrying out the fakes
6956656 not taking anything away from caleb but its a team effort and it takes all 11 guys to do that but he showed some speed tonight that i havent seen for a long time i hope it runs in the bloodlines
6956657 we just took advantage of some things that they were doing
6956658 we saw they had some guys in the box and our kids made some nice completions off of what they gave us
6956659 we didnt do a very good job taking care of the fundamental things on defense
6956660 we got ourselves back in it there with the one score and then we give up the darn kickoff return those are just momentum killers
6956661 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
6956662 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
6956663 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
6956664 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
6956665 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6956666 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6956667 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6956668 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6956669 mucha gente est todav a bajo los escombros hemos recuperado ocho cuerpos
6956670 es tradicional que cambie en la ceremonia de clausura cambie el abanderado y ya es oficial que ser llaneras
6956671 no hay vuelta atr s en mi despedida es una decisi n pensada consensuada con la familia es duro retirarse as pero ya est tomada la decisi n s que al principio mi cabeza va a sufrir pero hay que hacerlo
6956672 i highly recommend this team they over deliver on all of their projects
6956673 we resolved that no further executive powers will be given to tsvangirai
6956674 members were adamant that what he has been offered is enough and the issue of president mugabe maintaining his present executive powers is non negotiable
6956675 we were informed the sadc supports us in the deal including botswana i cant give you full details on the talks but we were fully briefed
6956676 if you convene parliament you are closing the door to negotiations
6956677 we are going to parliament to defend our mandate our problem is with the convening of parliament not the swearing in of members
6956678 phantoms of the brain probing the mysteries of the human mind
6956679 lets get coding because i know what to be done
6956680 staring at the dark green walls of a stinking prison cell at tshesebe police station just 50km shy of plumtree border post awaiting deportation from botswana to zimbabwe
6956681 for the continuation of power sharing talks between zanu pf and the two factions of the movement for democratic change mdc
6956682 it is critical that we conclude these negotiations very soon i hope that wise counsel and wisdom will prevail as the mdc we welcome the fact that the dialogue will continue under the framework of the memorandum of understanding we are fully and firmly committed to the process of dialogue failure is not an option
6956683 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
6956684 i know that there has been a request from mdc that tsvangirai will like to visit the country
6956685 the authorities in harare under the prevailing circumstances should not be represented at the political level at sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy
6956686 we must make it possible for every individual to lead the good life to win a place in the sun we are in danger of becoming a race of fear ridden neurotics we who live in the finest country on earth
6956687 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt
6956688 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
6956689 dr mwanawasa had been making steady progress until sunday night when his condition suddenly changed and required intervention
6956690 we are aware that the zimbabwean problem is an ongoing problem
6956691 therefore our president needs to continue to engage regional leaders to continue to assist us in resolving our crisis back home he is touring southern africa this week
6956692 this is not time for individual bravado i lose or win in impeachment proceedings the pakistani nation will be the loser
6956693 musharraf had so many opportunities to leave power gracefully but he missed every one
6956694 i dont think any other leader would have had that kind of commitment
6956695 he is the person behind the peace process and he was the first pakistani leader to reorient pakistans policy towards kashmir and ensure intra kashmiri interaction his leaving would create a void
6956696 during the period that i have been at the helm of affairs i have faced one challenge after another
6956697 pakistans economy is in a poor condition politics is in complete chaos and theres a rise in militancy and violence
6956698 he was personally tolerant and liberal but his positive contributions are not enough to overshadow his negative ones
6956699 im a revolutionary my life is meaningless a revolutionary by definition has no life whats important to me is zimbabwe fifty years from now what will be the mutambara legacy
6956700 those things are there but im a fighter and those things i just brush them off i didnt suffer because im a soldier soldiers dont suffer those things
6956701 i felt i needed to go to school to get experience and exposure and that will mean i can make a better contribution to zimbabwe now the time has come for me to jump from the pan into fire
6956702 are you crazy did you just decide to do this 30 seconds after being asked
6956703 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6956704 i definitely want to get something bad on the road it must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6956705 well i got 2 more as on my report card than so and so so can i have more allowance
6956706 wow how great that they want their employees to take time away and be with their families
6956707 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
6956708 i know lets make tiny animals with little tiny bodies and huge bobbling heads with freakishly large eyes
6956709 their attorneys brought them in they arrived one at a time they were booked photographed fingerprinted and processed the whole thing took half an hour for each
6956710 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
6956711 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
6956712 the aim of raw is to keep internal disturbances flaring up and the isi preoccupied so that pakistan can lend no worthwhile resistance to indian designs in the region
6956713 we are unclear about your intentions and you must know if you do not trust us we trust you even less
6956714 we are unclear about your intentions and you must know if you do not trust us we trust you even less
6956715 it should be passed on wednesday and judges should be restored
6956716 in my view they wont do aggressive counterinsurgency because they cant
6956717 this means they are less likely to cooperate not more
6956718 right now they care about whats in their own institutions interests

6956749 surprise theres some linux back ending all that windows media
6956750 a vulnerability was reported in openssh on red hat enterprise linux
6956751 what i do find annoying is that novell is continuing to feed microsofts fud machine about linux
6956752 i was back out in my cabin a few minutes ago and i heard a loud explosion
6956753 and i came out and looked down the valley i called my wife and she saw on the news there was a derailment or something
6956754 theres a lot of people that wont be able to go home and theyre going to need something to eat this evening
6956755 as far as im concerned thats part of my job as a citizen of this town
6956756 their land is filled with silver and gold and there is no end to their treasures
6956757 their land is filled with horses and there is no end to their chariots
6956758 they bow down to the work of their hands to what their own fingers have made
6956759 for behold the lord god of hosts is taking away from jerusalem and from judah support and supply all support of bread and all support of water the mighty man and the soldier the judge and the prophet the diviner an the elder the captain of fifty and the man of rank the counselor and the skillful magician and the expert in charms
6956760 and i will make boys their princes and infants shall rule over them
6956761 and the people will oppress each other every one his fellow and every one his neighbor
6956762 for jerusalem has stumbled and judah has fallen because their speech and their deeds are against the lord defying his glorious presence for the look on their faces bears witness against them they proclaim their sin like sodom they do not hide it woe to them for they have brought evil on themselves
6956763 your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle and her gates shall lament and mourn empty she shall sit on the ground
6956764 righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people the kings favor is toward a wise servant but his wrath is against him who causes shame
6956765 today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion on the day of testing in the wilderness where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years therefore i was provoked with that generation and said they always go astray in their heart they have not known my ways therefore as i swore in my wrath they shall not enter my rest
6956766 take care brothers lest there be in any of you an evil unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living god but exhort one another every day as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin
6956767 for who were those who heard and yet rebelled was it not all those who left egypt led by moses and to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest but to those who were disobedient so we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief therefore while the promise of entering his rest still stands let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it
6956768 how great are your works o lord your thoughts are very deep
6956769 and there are many other things that jesus did which if they were written one by one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written amen
6956770 plumb the depths of my grace and glory sail the surface of my eternal deeps
6956771 come sail away with me ill make you fishers of men
6956772 sorry no can do ive got fields and commitments that cost a pretty sum pray hold me excused i cannot come
6956773 by faith we understand that the universe was create by the word of god so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible
6956774 for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the creator who is forever praised amen
6956775 has a nation ever changed its gods even though they are no gods but my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit
6956776 what do you gain by going to egypt to drink the waters of the nile or what do you gain by going to assyria to drink the waters of the euphrates your evil will chastise you and your apostasy will reprove you know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the lord your god

6956781 i havent dated at all since deanna i wanted to give myself the time to heal so that when i got out there again i was really ready to give whoever i am with the respect and total attention she deserves and i am ready i am through it and open to giving these girls everything i can to find the one that is right for me
6956782 right now with two teams out of it its all about pace of game so they call a lot of first pitch strikes so everyone starts swinging the bat its a frustrating way to hit
6956783 if im not patient im not doing my job if they continue to do that purposely i dont have time for that but thats the way its going to be the rest of the season ive seen it happen before
6956784 i was trying to finish the year strong and instead im basically spinning my wheels
6956785 its tough i want to make things happen im not here just to be here if i didnt care id just drag the bat up there and then drag it back to the dugout

6956807 das verh ltnis zwischen staat und kirche muss neu definiert werden
6956808 man sollte dar ber nachdenken ob sich die kirche durch solche zusch sse nicht zu eng an den staat bindet und dadurch ihre unabh ngigkeit gef hrdet
6956809 aber wenn sie davon h ren sagen sie sofort dass die kirchen solche ausgaben aus ihren kirchensteuermitteln bezahlen sollten

6956827 ich w rde mir allerdings w nschen dass wir kanu frauen nicht immer nur alle vier jahre so in den blickpunkt r cken w rden
6956828 anfangs hatten wir ja selber zweifel aber es war definitiv die richtige entscheidung
6956829 dabei hatte ich ende juni noch gedacht ich muss die sachen packen und ein paar nachwuchsregatten bestreiten
6956830 dass in l ndern mit vielen bolzpl tzen und str nden viele gute fu baller heranwachsen wei und akzeptiert jeder dass deutschland aber auch ein land mit besonders vielen sch nen gew ssern ist auf den sich prima trainieren l sst wird leicht bersehen
6956831 aber genau deshalb ist es f r mich nur logisch dass wir auch eine gute kanu nation sind
6956832 wir brauchen sie auch nicht wir wollen eine gro e party feiern
6956833 kritik und tadel nicht aufbrausen sondern bernehmen was daran richtig ist und unberechtigte vorw rfe mit tolerantem l cheln zur ckweisen
6956834 gold sagt nur was wir alles erreichen k nnen wenn wir uns anstrengen aber es sagt nichts dar ber wie es weitergeht und auch nichts dass wir ein entwicklungsland sind
6956835 die veranstaltung der olympischen spiele 2008 hat die uhr f r den respekt vor menschenrechten in der volksrepublik china generell zur ckgesetzt

6956853 this is not what we expected every time we follow up these cases with the police they tell us they are still investigating when do they ever solve the cases we know how the people hate us in this country
6956854 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6956855 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6956856 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
6956857 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6956858 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6956859 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6956860 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6956861 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6956862 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6956863 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6956864 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6956865 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6956866 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6956867 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6956868 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6956869 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6956870 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6956871 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6956872 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6956873 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6956874 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6956875 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6956876 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6956877 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6956878 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6956879 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6956880 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6956881 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6956882 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6956883 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6956884 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6956885 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6956886 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6956887 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6956888 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6956889 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6956890 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6956891 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6956892 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6956893 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6956894 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6956895 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6956896 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6956897 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6956898 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6956899 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6956900 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6956901 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6956902 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6956903 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6956904 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6956905 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6956906 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6956907 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6956908 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6956909 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6956910 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6956911 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6956912 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6956913 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6956914 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6956915 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6956916 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6956917 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6956918 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6956919 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6956920 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6956921 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6956922 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6956923 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6956924 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6956925 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6956926 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6956927 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6956928 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6956929 this is a planning took where all things are going
6956930 being one who is not by nature litigious i am pleased with this step toward ending the long unnecessary conflict with mr lee spence
6956931 though i commend mr spences perseverance it has been proven time and again that he did not locate the h l hunley also it is my understanding that mr spence is in poor physical and financial health and i have no desire to add to these burdens
6956932 it is apparent that further litigation and continued affirmation of mr cusslers role in the discovery of the confederate submarine h l hunley is unnecessary
6956933 the court has now barred mr spences claim and the public the hunley commission and the national park service have expressly credited numa with the discovery of the h l hunley
6956934 i fought very hard to have my case heard because i wanted my day in court
6956935 why if cussler thought he could win he is dropping the case after seven years is beyond me
6956936 while lee is disappointed that he did not get his day in court he is satisfied that his find is vindicated in the court of public opinion
6956937 its apparent that cussler is satisfied with the recognition hes gotten
6956938 he the bus driver was speeding in a heavy downpour in an intersection that had standing water
6956939 design install test and inspect the bus roof structure and side window components including installation of laminated glass and failed to properly design install test and inspect a proper passenger seat belt system
6956940 16 middle class working men and one 78 year old grandmother
6956941 it was a house to live in and thats what the sponsor used it for
6956942 are trying to operate like we do in nevada and the local laws say you cant do it
6956943 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6956944 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6956945 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6956946 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6956947 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6956948 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6956949 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6956950 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6956951 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6956952 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6956953 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6956954 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6956955 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6956956 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6956957 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6956958 im not going to get into a mess again im not going to go there
6956959 the medicine im delivering is strong enough that it needs to have some humor with it
6956960 it will be wind it will be solar it will be biofuel and by golly it will be nuclear
6956961 every nuclear power plant that comes safely online makes us more energy independent
6956962 the french understand the nuclear waste problem and they recycle nuclear fuel
6956963 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president
6956964 a prominent philadelphia attorney and hillary clinton supporter filed suit this afternoon in the u s district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against illinois sen barack obama the democratic national committee and the federal election commission the action seeks an injunction preventing the senator from continuing his candidacy and a court order enjoining the dnc from nominating him next week all on grounds that sen obama is constitutionally ineligible to run for and hold the office of president of the united states berg cited a number of unanswered questions regarding the illinois senators background and in todays lawsuit maintained that sen obama is not a natural born u s citizen or that if he ever was he lost his citizenship when he was adopted in indonesia berg also cites what he calls dual loyalties due to his citizenship and ties with kenya and indonesia

6956971 thursday night august 21 we took the stage at caf iguana in monterrey mexico before we even started the intro to the set the crowd was roaring divine heresy over and over the intro started and the stage curtains opened to over 1 000 faces screaming back at us as we played our opener bleed the fifth the crowd erupted into a insane circle pit our new vocalist travis neal pushed the bereaved recieved the warmest welcome that he could ever expect to recieve the crowd accepted him right away and he hit everything perfectly as we tore through our set the energy of the audience did not stop from circle pits to the almighty wall of death the crowd was amazing the show was put on by monster energy drink and we cant thank them enough for the support promoter freddie ibbara has done a stand up job on these shows and we cant thank him enough for the hospitality that he has shown us monterreys crowd was insane we look farward to returning again in the future
6956972 we are beyond stoked to have travis on board with us and we immediately knew that he was the perfect guy for the job he definitely has the range and stage presence to make him one of the genres most lethal vocalists out there and the new material we are writing is going to smoke our debut its more brutal faster and pissed off so you better start preparing yourselves now until then we went ahead and re recorded bleed the fifth with travis and its just a little taste of what this guy is truly capable of so enjoy and we will see you soon

6956974 i love the way the defense plays teams have to beat us because we dont beat ourselves this team doesnt die theyre always battling
6956975 we had to do a lot of work inside and it took us a while to loosen up weve been able to get back into the playoff mix because a number of players have stepped up
6956976 i never knew he could put up these kind of numbers
6956977 i havent seen a guy sit out a year and come back to do what hes done its very impressive

6956987 his workload this year has been a lot more than last year so were just kind of monitoring him
6956988 were going to give him extra days here and there to make sure hes strong
6956989 hes passed all the rehab tests so hes ready to go
6956990 the whole thing is just to try to get the ball a little tighter at the plate
6956991 the path to all his pitches is good but theres just not that explosion that he should have
6956992 that stems back to some rigidity in his delivery were trying to get him looser he tries so hard that he has a tendency to overdo everything
6956993 why should it be this is a problem that is a fijian problem
6956994 it is all the fijian political parties all the registered political parties will participate and discuss the electoral reform that has been suggested

6957007 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6957008 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6957009 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6957028 the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit rejected a challenge to the heart of the act the creation of a nonprofit board to set auditing requirements and police the accounting firms that audit public companies
6957029 the legislation adopted in response to devastating accounting abuses at companies such as enron and worldcom was meant to restore public confidence in the stock market make executives more accountable and improve the audits on which shareholders depend to keep companies honest among other things it required top executives to certify corporate financial statements and subjected audit firms to periodic inspections by the new board
6957030 businesses have protested that the act imposed costly burdens and provided too little benefit the legal challenge was brought by beckstead and watts a nevada accounting firm that the oversight board accused of performing flawed audits and the free enterprise fund which advocates reduced taxes and limited government according to court papers
6957031 under the old system big audit firms inspected each other and found little to criticize
6957032 under sarbanes oxley consulting was restricted and the new board replaced the lobbying group as the auditors overseer in the years since president bush signed the law corrections to corporate financial statements became more commonplace as have disclosures that companies had serious weaknesses in their internal controls accounting firms received consolation in the form of expanded audit work and bigger audit fees

6957039 my country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
6957040 no man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted and no one ever retired more generally respected
6957041 but i did greatly broaden the use of executive power
6957042 his great task was to restore the dignity and prestige of the presidency when it had reached the lowest ebb in our history in a time of extravagance and waste
6957043 i felt like the moon the stars and all the planets had fallen on me
6957044 to build a great society a place where the meaning of mans life matches the marvels of mans labor

6957087 you know we dont grow most of the food we eat we wear clothes other people make we speak a language that other people developed we use a mathematics that other people evolved i mean were constantly taking things its a wonderful ecstatic feeling to create something that puts it back in the pool of human experience and knowledge

6957093 were here to put a dent in the universe otherwise why else even be here
6957094 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
6957095 the christian faith ought to persuade us that political controversies are always conflicts between sinners and not between righteous men and sinners it ought to mitigate the self righteousness which is an inevitable part of all human conflicts

6957099 we just released the latest upgrade to the inventory and recipe modules which includes the ability to use bar code readers and it works a treat really simple and fast it should be a great productivity tool for our customers here not just for stock takes but for internal transfers expensing and transferring recipes from kitchens to outlets etc
6957100 for me the beauty of online procurement systems such as marketboomer is the control over purchasing spend especially for a whole hotel group as an independent consultant i see many businesses struggling because they have no control mechanisms over their purchases and the prices they pay this can become a serious issue especially for groups
6957101 furthermore the climate change has particularly in australia become an important factor influencing fresh product prices enormously many businesses do not see this threat
6957102 the reporting facility of marketboomer is excellent it helps me particularly in the tendering process when i approach new suppliers with one mouse click i know exactly what capacity ihg purchases per year or month per hotel or even per department during my time as an executive chef this was a longsome process and far off todays accuracy
6957103 i was sceptic at the beginning but indeed it is such an effective and easy to use tool i like the idea of having a one to many communication method once you have posted a question many different answers suggestions come back
6957104 from my experience i believe that e procurement systems such as marketboomer mark the future of purchasing and not just in the hospitality business it is just a question of time until even businesses that seem to be resistant to online technology see the benefits of it
6957105 the marketboomer system saves me money as a manager the system guarantees the right product the right specification and the right supplier it provides savings and control

6957113 this indicates to me were going to have a very busy year
6957114 well do what we have to do for the public but we want to prevent fires from happening
6957115 fire officials are very very concerned that were going to see an increase in heating related deaths
6957116 i think were going to have a lot of people heating with wood that havent before
6957117 as long as theyre over there well continue to do it
6957118 she always thinks of others first she just feels for people
6957119 lisa called me in regards to sending one soldier a book
6957120 she and i sat at the kitchen table and said you know we need to do something
6957121 that was to give them a touch of fall from new england
6957122 once a little boy from hudson showed up and had collected beanie babies from his classmates he had three trash bags full of beanie babies

6957128 without any question there is a crisis in police training throughout the entire commonwealth of massachusetts
6957129 and the budget cuts recommended so far are only the beginning
6957130 all of our in service training is done there and weve sent recruits there its a huge loss for us im not looking forward to it because its going to cost us a lot more money
6957131 youre not going to be able to train the people
6957132 im hoping to enroll several candidates in the october academy but that may change now firearms training domestic assault training sexual assault training will probably be gone these are specialized training areas but the ones we need the most
6957133 theres just so much specialized training were going to be losing its not rocket science if you have a new procedure that comes out for heart surgeries all of the surgeons will learn it in service training should be statewide
6957134 its safe to say there are more cuts to come
6957135 its the same story as the in service there will be less of it
6957136 theres going to be lawsuits the training is completely inadequate statewide the most important issue for us is to have uniform training for every single police officer
6957137 to coordinate municipal law enforcement training and creating more efficient law enforcement facilities staffing instruction and preparedness
6957138 it doesnt make any sense to give up on a site that is permitted and ready to go
6957139 at the time the town decided to postpone further investigation until all five of the site analysis were complete
6957140 with the completion of the fruit street site analysis and solutions to the towns wastewater needs this site did not receive further evaluation
6957141 what weve got here is a case of advocacy rather than science

6957143 this plan was elaborate im typically skeptical but this one had me

6957145 hes very knowledgable about the television he asks if you want the invoice filled out to you or to your business hes a con man to the nth degree hes the definition of a confidence man hes a very good con man
6957146 i had a creepy crawley feeling he said how about i meet you half way you give me 6 600 and you give me the rest after you get the tvs i said no thats not happening then i left
6957147 never hand 4 500 in cash to someone in a parking lot your first move has to be to sit back and think about it if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
6957148 eu n o sei que tipo de garota eu sou
6957149 just had to put my dog down and i know its not an easy thing to do theyre part of the family
6957150 first let me say i have never written to a newspaper or called a radio show
6957151 my son was in the same hospital at that time
6957152 i cant say much right now because he was the victim of a violent crime
6957153 i can tell you his injuries have led to four strokes four operations and a seizure and doctors suggested we should put him in a home but hes living with us and you know what we find reasons to thank god
6957154 i used to get uncomfortable seeing people like my son i didnt want to look at them because it felt like i was staring yet it seemed wrong to turn away so i never knew how to handle it
6957155 but now ill say hi how are you doing because now i know what theyre going through and i wouldnt want anyone turning their eyes away from my son its a whole new understanding
6957156 sometimes after a surgery hell look like he went 10 rounds against muhammad ali
6957157 thats hard for me to see theres a lot more i could have put into that letter i taught him his abcs when he was 3 now im teaching them to him again at 39 things like that

6957166 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this interfaith gathering is proof of that
6957167 if you do not trust in god then we do not want to think of you as being one of us
6957168 if you do not trust in god then you are not invited to be one of us

6957173 ive been floating on a cloud the past year wanting this to happen for my dad
6957174 when i got the call about the dna the cloud disappeared from beneath me and i fell to the ground and crashed
6957175 i was actually keeping my hopes up i just thought the first one failed and theyd do another set do more testing and it would work out this time
6957176 in my mind i was hoping for a better result in my mind i was preparing to bring nellie home
6957177 im just trying to keep a good thought i hope this can lead us to the next step
6957178 he is committed to restoring his good name his career and the cooperative and productive relationships that he enjoyed with pittsburghs development community
6957179 i am contacting you because i know that you have worked with pat in the past and appreciate how much he has given to our city pat wants what each of us wants which is to move forward and get back to work
6957180 was a personal e mail to friends i never intended for the media to obtain a copy i was just doing what any wife would do to help her husband
6957181 while pat may be on paid leave his wife has lost her job they have suffered a loss of income in their family and at the same time an unexpected expense of legal fees for clearing his good name from a political attack against him
6957182 just the goodwill of a lot of good people in the development community who really feel for pat and what hes going through
6957183 had he not been a public official with some authority would they be giving him money if his name was joe schmo and he set up a legal defense fund would the same people be giving him money the answer probably is no
6957184 then why are they giving the money the reason is these donors probably think the donation will be influential in achieving their goals with city government
6957185 she was really proud of the job she was counted on to do every day she really loved the thrill of it
6957186 she was a strong enough person that she was able to keep things in order and minimize the chaos when the orders came flying in when the salesmen were disorderly she would keep them in line
6957187 it was a high pressure technical kind of job she loved it she would really see the doom and gloom of it she would really be thrilled by the high volume she liked being busy
6957188 she had a great sense of humor and was very strong willed she knew what she wanted and she usually got it she had a special spot she liked to sit at the nursing home she liked to watch the traffic go by watch people come and go and kept track of staff at bingo games she sat by the caller to make sure they called the right letters she was a delightful lady
6957189 present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god
6957190 i would hate to think i knew about this and one of my customers was injured due to my neglect
6957191 were just kind of blanketing the area as best we can with the contacts we have im hoping that for every one contact we have well generate 10 more contacts in the neighborhood of the business

6957201 i am terribly sorry that my actions reflected poorly on the university
6957202 however they must be judged in the unique context of college debate marked by its passion and rigorous intellectual engagement
6957203 students are operating in a culture where civility is declining
6957204 i reject the assertion that civility in debate is declining i would say if anything were trying to hold or teach the standards of civility in a very difficult cultural moment
6957205 our investigation indicated that there has been a decline in the civility and respect
6957206 im not talking about content they can discuss whatever subject they want but i believe you can make your points in a civil way
6957207 the kind of debate being used today in much of college debate falls short of our educational standards
6957208 did you believe your sister had just given birth to this boy

6957323 i dont think i got the best start the guys really took off at the top of the course there was a bit of a headwind it was tough
6957324 hurry up and get to the finish line it just didnt see to get any closer after about a hundred metres i thought to myself oh my god i have 900m to go then you kind of fall into a bit of a trance
6957325 the training takes over and all the kilometres and gym sessions and everything youve done takes over before you know it you have 300m to go and its like geez id better get into gear better get going
6957326 it felt like i almost fell in with about 10m to go
6957327 everything just kind of seized up the mind was still saying go go get to the line the body was starting to fall apart
6957328 i cant wait one more race to go one more medal to go

6957335 reps are cherished in this league as a quarterback so i mean every single rep whether it be a game or practice i try to make the absolute most out of

6957338 i did have an injury and was out some things happened and competition is a part of this game

6957340 you can be 14 2 and lose your job you can be 2 14 and lose your job

6957343 i see it i see it its going to be fun this year

6957347 one day i was watching oprah oprah winfreys talk show and they were showing a girl cutting her hair to donate to a cancer charity i thought if i did it here in lebanon it might catch on

6957349 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
6957350 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
6957351 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
6957352 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim

6957356 they urge that getting to know the world will develop their faculties and enable them to understand their own mind better that such a process will broaden their views and help them to judge things at their proper value finally that a vocation which cannot stand such a trial the buffeting of dangerous temptations and the seductive allurements of worldly pleasures to which it has been unnecessarily exposed is no vocation and had far better be abandoned

6957362 he sees things well and he reads and reacts quickly he understands what hes looking at he doesnt have to think about it he knows exactly what to do
6957363 hes accurate he has a presence to him he just needs to learn to manage the game and each game hes gotten decidedly better
6957364 but hes kind of like kurt in that he sees things really well and he has terrific composure
6957365 in a game it goes a little fast for him he gets a little frenetic
6957366 he got branded as a guy who went from place to place

6957369 i knew that if i kept improving and added several variations i would be able to dominate batsmen mendis will also go through such a stage when he would have to add a few tricks and variations so that he does not become predictable
6957370 from the moment i started i did not spin the ball much but i had variations and one needs to capture wickets to remain in the team i bowl according to my strength

6957391 the united states secret service has dispatched a protective detail to assume the immediate protection of sen joseph biden a source tells abc news indicating in all likelihood that biden has been officially notified that sen barack obama has selected him to be his running mate
6957392 at least three sources close to the plants operations reported the obama bayh material was being produced
6957393 of all the pressing local issues that need airing through additional public discourse such as the editorial pages coughing at symphony concerts would not have made my top 100 or so
6957394 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type
6957395 its one of the healthier leaf lettuces if obama is worried about the price of arugula then obviously he has a healthier diet than mccain
6957396 i think he has very good taste buds and im a republican
6957397 ive been given a bad hand but im not going to let it get me down im going to fight back and do everything i possibly can
6957398 the acceptance among movie stars is an acceptance that reflects a change in the national mores but is not held consistently across all dimensions
6957399 there is a sense that public figures are providing a model and they need to be above question

6957405 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6957406 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6957407 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry

6957451 the only explanation that makes sense is that he really does have a surprise pick or hes trying to convince someone to join the ticket
6957452 im of the view that at this point waiting is a good thing
6957453 obviously the announcements going to get a lot of attention but its very important to build interest for the convention the closer the announcement is to the convention the more newsy the convention is
6957454 this time you had the olympics intruding and not getting a sustained ride but having it peter out
6957455 things move so quickly that the inevitable negative front would have come in 48 hours in this case the convention occurring within 48 hours will cut off the inevitable scrutiny of the vice presidential pick
6957456 every day that goes by not only do you step on your own message but you forfeit the opportunity to have a candidate hitting four media markets a day
6957457 every dollar spent on candidate travel is much more highly leveraged than candidate ads so theyre giving all that up by waiting this long
6957458 he wanted to create buzz and thats exactly what he did
6957459 im in california everyones pulling out their cell phones hoping they want to be the first to know
6957460 there has been anticipation for days that the vice presidential announcement would happen toward the end of the week
6957461 we may wait until wednesday and do it right at the convention
6957462 its sort of like a long movie about the civil war we know who won if they did it friday evening at 5 30 they would dominate the evening news olympics or no olympics if they do it tomorrow it will dominate tomorrow and sunday and well move on as we go into the convention but it doesnt matter a whit to the outcome of the election i think we are consumed by this here we are sitting here talking about it
6957463 the obama campaign has been masterful in building suspense and then like any good production there has to be a payoff at the end
6957464 they have done a masterful job in owning the media attention over the pick and understanding the presss fascination and obsession with the processes
6957465 a lot of the success of this is based on stagecraft the first 24 to 48 hours is the crucial period in informing the publics conception of the pick
6957466 the attention span of the media has gotten so short now that you cant drive a vice presidential pick for a week
6957467 the story gets more and more absurd every four years its underwhelming by definition
6957468 absent an inexplicable lapse in judgment these picks when all is said and done are never the most important things that happen during the campaign
6957469 they might have delayed it one day because they were enjoying the mccain house meltdown

6957472 gore insists the only real obstacle is the reluctance of americas leaders to seek bold solutions to high energy prices and global warming he likened his challenge to president john f kennedys 1961 call to put a man on the moon
6957473 the goal is the most ambitious energy plan by a major u s political figure and one many energy experts say is unrealistic

6957475 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future

6957480 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
6957481 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
6957482 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
6957483 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
6957484 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
6957485 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
6957486 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
6957487 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
6957488 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
6957489 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
6957490 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
6957491 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet

6957496 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6957497 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6957498 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6957499 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6957500 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6957501 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6957502 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6957503 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6957504 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6957505 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6957506 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6957507 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6957508 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6957509 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6957510 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6957511 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6957512 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night

6957514 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
6957515 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6957516 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6957517 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6957518 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6957519 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6957520 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6957521 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6957522 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6957523 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6957524 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6957525 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6957526 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6957527 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6957528 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6957529 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6957530 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6957531 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6957532 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6957533 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6957534 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6957535 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6957536 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6957537 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6957538 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6957539 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6957540 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6957541 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6957542 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6957543 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6957544 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6957545 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6957546 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6957547 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6957548 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6957549 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6957550 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6957551 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6957552 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation
6957553 the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need
6957554 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
6957555 betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
6957556 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
6957557 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
6957558 every seat will be a great seat as we listen to barack obama communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the challenges americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
6957559 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6957560 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6957561 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6957562 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6957563 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6957564 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6957565 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6957566 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6957567 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6957568 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6957569 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6957570 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6957571 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6957572 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6957573 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6957574 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6957575 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6957576 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6957577 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6957578 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6957579 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6957580 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6957581 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6957582 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6957583 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6957584 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6957585 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6957586 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6957587 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6957588 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6957589 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6957590 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6957591 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6957592 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6957593 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6957594 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6957595 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6957596 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6957597 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6957598 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6957599 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6957600 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6957601 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real
6957602 possible to kill more flies with honey than with vinegar
6957603 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6957604 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6957605 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6957606 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6957607 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6957608 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6957609 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6957610 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6957611 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6957612 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6957613 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6957614 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6957615 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6957616 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6957617 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6957618 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6957619 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6957620 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6957621 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6957622 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6957623 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6957624 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6957625 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6957626 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6957627 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6957628 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6957629 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6957630 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6957631 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6957632 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6957633 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6957634 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6957635 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6957636 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6957637 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6957638 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6957639 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6957640 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6957641 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6957642 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6957643 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6957644 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6957645 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6957646 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6957647 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6957648 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6957649 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6957650 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6957651 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6957652 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6957653 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6957654 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6957655 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6957656 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6957657 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6957658 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6957659 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6957660 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6957661 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6957662 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6957665 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6957666 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6957667 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6957668 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6957669 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6957670 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6957671 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6957672 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6957673 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6957674 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6957675 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6957676 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6957677 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6957678 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6957679 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6957680 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6957681 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6957682 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6957683 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6957684 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6957685 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6957686 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6957687 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6957688 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6957689 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6957690 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6957691 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6957692 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6957693 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6957694 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6957695 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6957696 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6957697 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6957698 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6957699 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6957700 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6957701 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6957702 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6957703 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6957704 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6957705 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6957706 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6957707 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6957708 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6957709 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6957710 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

6957726 people have been here every step of the way every step of the way
6957727 we just hope theyre crossing all their ts and dotting all their is and making sure that its done right
6957728 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6957729 he was a sweet good boy very outgoing caring and everybody loved him
6957730 he brought a frog and a gecko home and his dad told him hed have to feed them or let them go

6957737 i turned around and noticed the door was broken and there was a mess on the floor so i decided to just back up and leave
6957738 all i did was give her a big hug and told her i didnt care if they took the whole house as long as you and the baby are ok thats it

6957747 this marvelous experience often occurs as if it were the effect of a superior and invisible power acting on the person from without this delightful and singular state gives no advance warning it is as unexpected as a ghost an intermittent haunting from which we must draw if we are wise the certainty of a better existence this acuteness of thought this enthusiasm of the senses and the spirit must have appeared to man through the ages as the first blessing
6957748 1 ekstasis means any casting down of a thing from its proper place or state displacement i e occultism 2 a throwing of the mind out of its normal state astral projections alienation of consciousness whether such as makes a lunatic or that of a man who by some sudden emotion is transported as it were out of himself so that in this rapt condition although he is awake his mind is drawn off from all surrounding objects and wholly fixed on things divine that he sees nothing but the forms and images lying within and thinks that he perceives with his bodily eyes and ears realities shown him by god 3 the state of one who either owing to the importance or the novelty of an event is thrown into a state of blended fear and wonderment
6957749 it just hasnt taken off here in the tri cities area yet but we hope it will

6957776 shes been such a great leader and role model everyone on this team we grew up watching her play i remember my first wnba game was at the great western forum watching her this year has been closure in a lot of ways
6957777 the way lisa handles her business sets a great example for the youngsters who are here now and hopefully theyll spread similar lessons to the people who come after
6957778 thats why the womens side has been so consistent we try to impart the importance of a long term commitment on the ones who are here for the first time
6957779 we wasnt a team in 2004 we were a bunch of individuals put on a basketball team we didnt have much time to prepare and we didnt take care of business and look at it like it was our last game every game we played it hurt us
6957780 youre seeing a kind of college atmosphere with everyone cheering for one another its all about each other not about i if you had put this team on the court back in 2004 maybe it was a different outcome
6957781 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
6957782 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here

6957791 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6957792 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6957793 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6957794 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6957795 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6957804 like i say ive got two things going on at one time and im trying my best to separate them out
6957805 it would mean a lot whenever us players play and you play at a high level for a period of time that becomes a goal
6957806 its a goal with every u s player out here is to try to be part of that team even though it sounds like its nerve wracking and a tough week you want to be a part of it to experience that and to play for the country and to just take it all in and see what its all about

6957838 the 3 mobile contract expires at the end of this season and samsung who are currently our shorts sponsor and technology partner were keen to increase their involvement at the club

6957854 what joy domestic sport stars delivering world beating performances under maximum pressure in place of the usual hard luck stories and feeble excuses for failure we have feasted at the top table of olympic prowess
6957855 its a fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team
6957856 in athens the countrys medal total was 30 which was fewer than nine other countries but in beijing the empire has bounced back
6957857 without long term training programmes we cant maintain the level of our athletes and have little chance of winning medals
6957858 china is set to win 50 golds at the beijing olympics clearing the shame of winning five golds at the 1988 seoul olympics
6957859 this success is due to support from the whole country and chinas devil style training those who can survive the devil style training can win gold
6957860 devil style training chinas road to gold is paved with blood and tears
6957861 in china the state trains athletes from kindergarten until they win medals paying their salary hiring coaches and building gymnasiums
6957862 in the west athletes train in clubs and pay for training hours coaches and the use of swimming pool some clubs charge ten dollars for each hours use of the club us swimming champion michael phelps trains by himself
6957863 in taiwan everything is amateur young athletes train after they finish class in the afternoon
6957864 the soviet style training does not suit taiwan because it contradicts human nature and the athletes are unhappy
6957865 it works in china because chinese people are used to being told what to do by the government we should shift the focus from training a handful of athletes to win gold to promoting sports to improve public health
6957866 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy

6957872 es muy dolorosa la derrota a manos de un rival tan encarnizado como argentina pero es un gran equipo y nosotros tardamos s lo cinco minutos en perder el partido
6957873 as es el f tbol unas veces se pierde y otras se gana por desgracia era una fase eliminatoria de un torneo y nos quedamos fuera
6957874 yo no creo que nuestro f tbol haya sido negativo aqu nos han pasado muchas cosas buenas para m y para todo el grupo participar en los juegos ol mpicos ha sido una experiencia nica algo muy grande hemos ganado la medalla de bronce adem s como todo el mundo ha podido ver ten amos un equipo muy unido

6957886 its really impressive to stay in the village its nice to see how beautiful the different athletes are to see people of different sizes colours
6957887 after these olympics ill take a different look at different sports other than just football because i now know more about them
6957888 i also saw other athletes like rafael nadal some of our players also had their picture taken with juan riquelme whom they like a lot
6957889 its good to be going in as underdogs of course if you look at the polls like 90 per cent think argentina will win that couldnt be better for us
6957890 the pressure will all be on them we have good players and argentina have good players the difference is all the pressure will be on them
6957891 its very important to reach a final but we have to win it beating brazil was very special for many reasons but nobody is going to remember that if we lose the final
6957892 the thing with brazil was beautiful but its gone it will be worth nothing if we do not beat nigeria and get the gold medal
6957893 nous pensons quil sagit l dune action non violente extr mement importante au moment o le tibet traverse une p riode tr s difficile en particulier la p riode post olympique
6957894 ce sera lune des campagnes non violentes les plus importantes pour obtenir le soutien de la communaut internationale pour la lutte contre loppression dans le monde et en particulier au tibet
6957895 kind of way in a way that kills the souls of those you take from when will you open your eyes never is my guess it makes my heart sad every time
6957896 la oscuridad se disipa autom ticamente cuando uno enciende la luz
6957897 sa saintet a exprim son sentiment sur la situation qui r gne actuellement au tibet et notamment quil y a une certaine forme de r pression extr mement brutale qui continue r gner en parall le aux jeux olympiques
6957898 s ance de rattrapage apr s l chec total de la diplomatie sarkozyste sur le dossier chinois
6957899 a toujours eu une grande sympathie pour la cause du tibet donc son soutien personnel et en tant que ce ministre est tout fait acquis il la clairement redit et il me semble que cest parfaitement sinc re
6957900 la magnificence des jo contraste avec la terreur au tibet
6957901 das ist unabh ngig von der rechtsform das beste ergebnis in der 98 j hrigen geschichte des bvb
6957902 hier noch weiter fu ball gespielt werden kann oder nicht
6957903 vor solch einem wichtigen spiel sollte man einen gegner weder abwerten noch aufbauen
6957904 damit muss man nicht automatisch unter die ersten drei bis f nf mannschaften kommen
6957905 es ist wichtig dass wir daraus eine gro e gemeinschaftsaktion machen bayern ist in allen spielen favorit
6957906 wir brauchen daher jeden mann jede frau und jedes kind um diesem gegner paroli zu bieten
6957907 oh you ruined me fucking oh my god ill never be the same
6957908 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6957909 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6957910 what swelled liver youre getting your daily dose of vitamin c and b12 with each can drink it up mr athlete
6957911 if we do get him back and thats certainly possible we might get him back on a part time basis
6957912 it would be tough to get him back and expect him to play every game
6957913 i didnt want to be a pity case and say pay me
6957914 the medical cartel at the highest level is not out to help people it is out to harm them to weaken them
6957915 the medical monopoly or medical trust euphemistically called the american medical association is not merely the meanest monopoly ever organized but the most arrogant dangerous and despotic organisation which ever managed a free people in this or any other age
6957916 america is at that awkward stage its too late to work within the system but too early to shoot the bastards
6957917 to the rockefellers socialism is not a system for redistributing wealth especially not for redistributing their wealth but a system to control people and competitors
6957918 just look at us everything is backwards everything is upside down doctors destroy health lawyers destroy justice universities destroy knowledge governments destroy freedom the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality
6957919 the us whose health care system is monopolised by corporations has the worst infant mortality rate compared to 23 other wealthy countries whose health care system is still partly in public hands us health care corporations are powerful lobbyists and generous financial benefactors to politicians on capitol hill the us has 5 of the worlds population and it spends 45 of the worlds health dollars despite this americans life expectancies are the lowest of 23 other wealthy nations and lower than some third world countries like costa rica but not for long
6957920 globalisation is exporting this model to the rest of the world
6957921 this can only mean that corporate health care creates sickness disability and death and profits from it
6957922 of all forms of tyranny the least attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth the tyranny of plutocracy
6957923 i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country
6957924 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the u s since the days of andrew jackson
6957925 as political theorist michael parenti points out historians often overlook fascisms economic agenda the partnership between big capital and big government in their analysis of its authoritarian social program
6957926 it is also in the interests of a tyrant to keep his people poor so that they may not be able to afford the cost of protecting themselves by arms and be so occupied with their daily tasks that they have no time for rebellion
6957927 given the choice between intersecting with a monetary system that leaves a detailed electronic trail of all ones financial activities and a parallel system that ensures anonymity and privacy people will opt for the latter
6957928 the planet is being controlled to an alarming extent by elites or as i call them cartels there are many cartels but 7 are the most powerful they evolve they learn from one another they both compete and cooperate unfortunately the trend is more towards cooperation
6957929 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the u s since the days of andrew jackson
6957930 a government which robs peter to pay paul can always depend on the support of paul
6957931 our only political party has two right wings one called republican the other democratic
6957932 organized medicine is now as much a part of the american government as organized religion had been of the government in fifteenth century spain
6957933 they are running a monopoly and they will lie cheat and steal to keep it that way
6957934 the planet is being controlled to an alarming extent by elites or as i call them cartels there are many cartels but 7 are the most powerful they evolve they learn from one another they both compete and cooperate unfortunately the trend is more towards cooperation
6957935 the medical monopoly or medical trust euphemistically called the american medical association is not merely the meanest monopoly ever organized but the most arrogant dangerous and despotic organisation which ever managed a free people in this or any other age
6957936 society today is paying a heavy price in disease and death for the monopoly granted the medical profession in the 1920s
6957937 insurance companies are cost plus providers which have no incentive to reduce costs
6957938 we know the answer to cancer yet the authorities in the form of the law of the land uk will not allow this book the good news on cancer to be promoted to lay persons
6957939 today in the us only a medical doctor can diagnose a disease prescribe something and cure you
6957940 yes if you take this drug you will cure yourself
6957941 the medical and scientific establishments have largely through the fact that they have sold out to the enormously wealthy and powerful international pharmaceutical industry obtained more or less complete control over politicians and the media advertisements for my book
6957942 in the state of california as well as others it is illegal to treat cancer with anything but surgery radiation or chemotherapy
6957943 chemotherapy radiation and surgery are the law of the land as cancer treatments for political not therapeutic reasons
6957944 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive
6957945 barack will stand up for your family unless you dont want them
6957946 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
6957947 my love story with rachel was a hell of a lot more romantic than the notebook

6957959 zardari thanked pakistan peoples party of which he is the co chairman and said he will announce his decision within the next 24 hours

6957962 i will stand by you and if others leave you i will not because i love you and it is my job to be devoted to you loyal to you and you can count on that you may lean on me
6957963 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6957964 ow my stuff and my other stuff it all hurts
6957965 umm ive never met you but i enjoyed your show
6957966 oh hey dee havent seen you since that weird gig
6957967 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6957968 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6957969 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president

6958005 he did not work the weekend in early july when we had all the hendra issues
6958006 bens role was also more in mobile veterinary practice so he spent more time away from the clinic
6958007 i have an incident in my mind where i suspect it could have happened and in that particular instance that horse was normal it was before it came ill with hendra virus
6958008 the girl who got sick works in the hospital all the time and is one of our senior nurses so i think she had more opportunity
6958009 there were many many people in our clinic who were exposed to these horses on a close basis for an extended period of time and thankfully the great majority did not get infected
6958010 i have no feelings of grudge against anyone who challenges what we did
6958011 i would do absolutely nothing different and feel we did exceptionally well in handling the outbreak and called the authorities very quickly
6958012 i have asked for an independent review of the departments emergency response

6958014 if for the sake of argument the dead are not raised then let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
6958015 since christ is raised live for the resurrection do not sow to the flesh rather seek the lasting and true hapiness to be found by seeking the satisfaction that can be found only in christ jesus
6958016 if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the gospels it would seem that our lord finds our desire not too strong but too weak we are half hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased

6958042 we havent yet signed a memorandum of understanding mou with amc for sterilization programme in west zone
6958043 in the north zone of amc there are a lot of irregularities in construction of commercial buildings most of the structures are in complete violation of building rules and norms but nothing has been done so far against them
6958044 prima facie these indemnity bonds are just giving a leeway to illegal construction owners existing s t r u c t u re s have no space for parkings and margin area how can they do it now
6958045 amcs town development officers tdo are also to be held responsible as they have failed in keeping a control over the ongoing illegal construction work it seems they too are hand in gloves with these builders
6958046 there is an urgent need for a grievance cell where anyone can report about these illegal structures and it should be under the direct juridiction of municipal commissioner

6958100 right now with two teams out of it its all about pace of game so they call a lot of first pitch strikes so everyone starts swinging the bat its a frustrating way to hit
6958101 if im not patient im not doing my job if they continue to do that purposely i dont have time for that but thats the way its going to be the rest of the season ive seen it happen before
6958102 i was trying to finish the year strong and instead im basically spinning my wheels

6958112 el xito de los gobiernos de la concertaci n en el combate a la delincuencia
6958113 governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive because it is primarily in cities that a nations cultural traditions are preserved and generated
6958114 to truly understand your own culture no matter how you define it requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture one that is distinctly different from your own
6958115 tradition and modernization are incompatible one must choose between them
6958116 originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before it means putting old ideas together in new ways
6958117 the function of science is to reassure the purpose of art is to upset
6958118 rituals and ceremonies help define a culture without them societies or groups of people have a diminished sense of who they are
6958119 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
6958120 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
6958121 i have a lot of old t shirts it would take me hours to sort through all of them

6958126 rhee is trying to get rid of the veteran teachers rhee is trying to get rid of the black teachers i understand the anxiety
6958127 what i need is for you to have trust in me and in the school district
6958128 i know that trust doesnt come overnight and i have to earn that trust
6958129 once people dont trust a police officer in immigrant communities they become communities that foster crime where people wont report domestic violence or the theft of a tv if people feel they are under threat of being deported they become silent there has to be a delicate balance
6958130 your wife runs a red light on her way to the store
6958131 there is a moral issue here we are here to provide not only law enforcement but justice
6958132 some people talk of fears of terrorizing immigrant communities but if youre not involved in criminal activity youll probably never come in contact with these programs
6958133 the media make it seem like if you are out mowing your grass well snatch you from your yard and arrest and deport you that is just not the case
6958134 can clearly be showcased by the campaign as someone very much in sync with the message of the nominee
6958135 mayors have been at the forefront unlike in years past
6958136 we want to know that no matter who is representing us theyll put issues affecting cities high on their agenda were the backbone of the country and thats our mantra

6958159 it was one of those games that you needed to turn it on i think everybody felt that even the novices that dont know as much as coaches do
6958160 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6958161 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6958162 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6958163 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6958164 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6958165 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists
6958166 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence

6958169 this isnt only about protecting families living in suburban areas from nearby brothels although that is important its also about protecting women and children caught up in the sex trade from the exploitation that even legal brothels cant stop we should be prosecuting the perpetrators of prostitution and helping the victims get out
6958170 tattoos let people create an identity and help give meaning to their lives
6958171 we have seen riots in some 30 countries around the world a the protests where people really went down ed because they couldnt afford the flour anymore and rice and maize and corn and i think that is whats concerning so many government leaders
6958172 who the heck are you and what the heck is that thing in front of your face
6958173 its hard because people dont want to get rid of the furniture and things theyve loved for 50 years i had things my children had made in the first grade
6958174 the thing im happiest about is that we did it while we were still able and we could pack and make the decisions we didnt keep putting it off and putting it off
6958175 i was on the glenwood board when the village was in the planning stages and i said hey we want one of those
6958176 one of the things at our house that had gotten to be too much was the yard and hes not a yard person anyway
6958177 we sat down and thought about the future which a lot of people dont do
6958178 its about 1 450 or 1 460 square feet and our old house was 3 000 but we dont miss the space
6958179 i assume you that whatever you did for the humblest of my brothers you did for me i assume you that whatever you did not do to the humblest of my brothers you failed to do for me
6958180 you need to figure out what youre going to be comfortable with
6958181 you need to decide what furniture youre going to take and decide what kind of neighborhood and surroundings youre going to feel comfortable in and have a yard you can take care of
6958182 she has no children at home and her husband passed away shes on her own
6958183 she lives out in the country a ways and she wants to move closer to marietta
6958184 they want to move out of town and avoid city taxes but thats an individual decision
6958185 normally its a process of elimination and its over time
6958186 we just found her a one story living space but it took her that long to find something that was newer and didnt require a lot of maintenance
6958187 it isnt something thats going to happen in two or three months
6958188 the first thing is they need to assess their current situation
6958189 they need to decide how much of their furniture theyre going to be taking with them they need to narrow it down to one or two places and then decide the pros and cons of moving to a certain area
6958190 its great that we have places like glenwood retirement community the inn at marietta and other professional assisted living
6958191 but some people arent ready to take the step they still want some independence but they might not be able to take care of their yard or pay the bills in the house they have
6958192 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven mt 18 3
6958193 they can do for the little world in which they move as much as adults can for their big world they can live holy lives they can testify to the power of god to save they can sing the songs of salvation so sweetly that often proud hard hearted grown up people will be compelled to listen and made to feel and weep they can pray not perhaps with much oratorical glitter or the ability to convey any great amount of information to the almighty but none the less they can intercede for souls and pray the fervent effectual prayer which avails as much in a little child as in a man when that prayer is wrought by the holy spirit we see how they can often find entrance where the doors are closed against their elders and that in life and in death their words have frequently a power on those who love them which no minister deacon or salvation army officer could ever hope to wield for all these reasons we say teach train watch over and care for the children
6958194 you must make the children understand that god expects them to do their share of the fighting and encourage them to do it beget within them the conviction that soul saving is going to be their life work and get them fired with the ambition to go to their post and die there before they are brought into contact with cold freezing unbelieving half hearted professors
6958195 some parents are continually putting before their children future aggrandisement and fortune as a stimulus to industry and effort thus holding up to their young minds this worlds prosperity and applause as the great aim and object of life to get to be more learned more genteel more wealthy than men of their own class so that they may be received into higher circles of worldly society
6958196 i played against the guys in practice so it will be fun to compete against them in a different setting
6958197 i talk to guys all the time check on them see how camps treating them
6958198 everybody seems to be doing well i wish those guys the best
6958199 but we got a guy in the deal that has fit in well and made a lot of plays in practice
6958200 i can finally run the way i want to run
6958201 its not like when i get in the game im trying to score a touchdown every play i can run and get a feel for whats going on
6958202 everybody remembers me as a scat back but i went to school at michigan and we run downhill i just never got the opportunity to do that while i was here
6958203 im just waiting my turn when i get it im going to make the most of it all i can say is the best is yet to come
6958204 nobody wants to talk about it but everyone knows its there
6958205 im not a huge fan of people pranking me back so i just like to watch and get a good laugh
6958206 his physical abilities are unbelievable he has great leadership he obviously is explosive hes fast hes unbelievably strong he just does his job silently
6958207 we look at it as an opportunity to get better to learn from james
6958208 he said i swear if one more little kid comes up to me and says james can i get your autograph
6958209 when you have such a great linebacker like james its tough to be in that spotlight but at the same time you get an opportunity that a lot of people want to see him play and youre able to showcase your talent
6958210 theres a lot of pros but i dont see too many cons if youre eager for that spotlight then maybe youre not happy but the good thing about us linebackers were not selfish guys
6958211 austin doesnt forget thats the thing it might take him a couple of days a couple of weeks youll hear him complaining but something is going to happen
6958212 anything bad that happens to him he thinks its me

6958214 if youre a hard worker and you do the right things i think its bound to happen sometime

6958218 the united states olympic committee gave us a really fancy box to keep it in so i put it right on the stand next to my bed
6958219 ive kept it open so before i go to bed and then again when i wake up its the first thing i see
6958220 she dangled it in front of me but thats it
6958221 everybody floats their boat differently but i just dont understand why anybody would want to do such a thing
6958222 some people after they just had gone through a ban would say man i shouldnt do that again but i guess other people just get so hungry for it they figure its the olympics and they have to do well
6958223 to me if thats what i had to do to compete i wouldnt want to be in the sport and besides all the other reasons i look at my future too i want to have kids some day and that could have a real effect on how they come out
6958224 to see how i was doing and see if i needed anybody to talk to
6958225 she epitomizes the olympic creed especially that last part about the most essential thing being not to have conquered but to have fought well
6958226 i always wanted to see the american flag raised for something ive done and this time i knew id done something to represent my country well

6958243 its such a text that you cant change it i have certain suggestions or certain interpretations i have been keeping the play intact and i have been breaking the play at several places besides this i have been adding my own ideas into it the play is intact but its not a play nor is it a transitional play it is a pure film i have been throwing all these scenes on it through vast locations
6958244 i think they wanted the producers of this film the sort of sensibility which i had in the films titanic and shall we dance the sorts of scoring that i was doing in those movies which people are familiar in here in india so i think it wont be as big shock as some people thought it will be but yes it has a different approach
6958245 my association with three ladies actress in the film is very strange in the film this character mohanlal s character in the film has got very strange ideas because he loves to make things very big he is renowned architect so it s a passion and it s a creation so this man lives in a different plane so he reacts with these ladies in different planes

6958247 both the state and federal governments have significant leverage in this industry they have significant regulatory leverage and they are significant customers in their own right particularly the commonwealth
6958248 it is not acceptable that an american transnational decides to wreak havoc on the domestic aerospace industry quite without any necessity
6958249 the government needs to review its procurement policy to punish companies that unnecessarily wreak havoc on the manufacturing industry

6958301 i can talk in front of people now and they will listen since i have the knowledge
6958302 we dont really have building materials now but we do have a lot of empty shipping containers perhaps building with materials like these could show that people are struggling to have homes even with no materials

6958304 ask them to do all they can to allow more people to enter each day

6958306 the first step for the project starts with the drawings for the home an engineering consultancy company in gaza may want to provide this service as a donation from their company the next step is to get the approval from the engineering association which also may be for free or with a big discount this phase is the beginning and can show the world that the community still seeks to work in a healthy environment and uphold its responsibilities
6958307 it was tough and in my condition i was not sure i could think straight

6958309 i had no idea child mothers go through this kind of hell
6958310 ive only heard about them dropping from school but apparently their problems are more than just missing on educational opportunities
6958311 given a second chance i would not make the same mistakes i made because i now know how to be more assertive
6958312 i know more about setting life goals and working towards meeting them i will not let having this baby hinder me from attaining my goals
6958313 the increase in the cost of food has made is very difficult for everyone many areas are receiving food aid but it is just a scratch on the surface it is having an impact on our microcredit program so we are also providing an alternative which is repayment with 6 female rabbits offspring this of course will take some time to give us a return but will in the long run supply us with more breeding stock which we sorely need always a challenge we are also looking at setting up meat processing facilities as we will need them soon enough in some areas

6958317 gemini has proved that men can become strong pillars in advocating for women rights
6958318 women fear plunging into elective politics for this reason men use violence to subjugate us but this healing process will help us overcome these stereotypes
6958319 im glad gemini does not support any political partys agenda and this empowerment process will greatly assist us gain leadership skills

6958326 of course discrimination exists in our society against all kinds of minorities
6958327 bollywood is a secular industry and this is a communal statement
6958328 this is dangerous she is giving fodder to politicians who can blow this out of proportion there are many colonies in mumbai of many communities which do not allow people from other social and religious groups why isnt she talking about them
6958329 ar rahman sent me a message once saying you are an ambassador for islam i think i truly am
6958330 indians by nature right now are very secular have been very secular and the biggest case in point is that a muslim guy is one of the top stars for the last 13 years they have accepted me nobody has ever questioned my religion
6958331 what is really quite amazing for me is that coincidental as it is at a time when fundamentalism has been at the fore politically three of indias leading stars are khans shah rukh salman and myself i think what it indicates really is that the common man is not deeply affected by the virus of intolerance as yet or else it would be inconceivable that shah rukh and i could be as popular as we are
6958332 i too was reprimanded for waxing my arms out of curiosity when i was in 9th standard
6958333 the poor guy the had no option but to shave off his head

6958336 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
6958337 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
6958338 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
6958339 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

6958345 we know from experience that photojournalists love macs and that our software is used by a huge segment of this industry
6958346 our goal is to get them to fall in love with aperture but were perfectly happy to have them using other tools as well
6958347 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6958348 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6958349 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6958350 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers

6958353 definitely we would rather have won more races and we have had some chances but in the end it wasnt to be
6958354 we are still in a good position for the championship and although the season could have been much better it could also have been much worse
6958355 lately the races have not exactly been what i was expecting but hopefully we will get back to where we should be
6958356 the biggest issue has been getting stuck behind people following a bad qualifying so if we can sort out that then we should be fine
6958357 we just need to work on some things and hopefully we will get back to winning some races
6958358 there is no one real issue sometimes it goes right sometimes not
6958359 at the last race i ran off the circuit which doesnt help but then we havent exactly been happy with the handling which easily makes it look worse than it really is
6958360 the problem is it is very close between everybody now and if you are one 10th of a second slower you lose three places
6958361 we would have fixed it if we knew what to do but i think we will find a solution
6958362 we just need to put more effort in and try to get it right we will see what we can do
6958363 when i walked it on thursday i thought it would be fun and after yesterday it confirmed that impression
6958364 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room they have really done a good job
6958365 overtaking will be difficult but as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying
6958366 i knew i wanted to do trial work and that i would rather represent the people of the community to make sure i was able to serve justice and give back for the chances opportunities and education ive been given
6958367 ive enjoyed serving this community and i look forward to continuing to serve the state of georgia
6958368 im really lucky to have great people to work with here
6958369 i have a great boss in pete skandalakis district attorney for the coweta judicial circuit hes been a good leader and good example to follow while developing into a young professional
6958370 when pat first came out of law school he was a little unsure of himself but he has learned very very quickly and now he is probably one of the smartest attorneys that ive ever had the privilege of working with
6958371 he is also very good with victims he really has taken victims issues to heart and he does everything he can to take the victims point of view into consideration
6958372 pat is quiet and reserved but he would go to the mat for cases that he believes in
6958373 ive had the opportunity to learn a lot about him and he embodies what a prosecutor should be
6958374 no its against my principles as a professional to make you look even worse now lets try something that will improve your look

6958385 weve got an extremely vulnerable victim in this case multiple attempts have already been made to influence the victim and witnesses we really are afraid its going to happen again
6958386 you have to say this never happened or at the very least ask for a mental evaluation
6958387 what we could agree on and were willing to agree on
6958388 i fear that will have a poison pill that will make it unacceptable but at least the rhetorics changed

6958395 our research of coweta is already showing signs of a classic bedroom economy while cowetas population growth is among the areas fastest the corresponding slow growth in wages should raise concerns

6958476 even if a hacker figures out a way to make voice calls from an iphone procured from our stores using a non airtel sim he will not be able to access any of the airtel live or airtel apps features built into all the iphones sold by airtel weve built in suitable levels of security to ensure both applications remain out of bounds for hackers all iphones distributed by airtel will run on osx version 2 os which also powers apple notebooks worldwide
6958477 airtels it group has worked with apple for over a year to uniquely evolve a bunch of operator specific applications on the iphone in fact airtel is perhaps the only mobile operator besides australias optus that has evolved operator specific applications on apples iconic phone
6958478 developing operator specific iphone applications was pretty much a stealth exercise that transpired by leveraging airtels service delivery platform which is a 100 million tech initiative

6958504 in a lawsuit filed yesterday a camden county woman accused her orthopedic surgeon of
6958505 i want to give you my take on this as a physioprof who works at a highly prestigious medical school and academic medical center
6958506 royal college of obstetrics and gynaecologists president professor sabaratnam arulkumaran said we are very proud of these standards for the first time we have a robust framework for women centred care in a complete package this is shining example of multidisciplinary teamwork between the different specialties and groups who are after all working toward the same goal for the benefit of women he said anna dixon kings fund director of policy welcomed the guidance maternity staff are issued with too many standards by a range of organisations which places considerable burdens on staff without delivering commensurate safety improvements she said should go some way towards reducing this burden by ensuring staff are not faced with too many separate and complex guidelines she added
6958507 key standard 11 gynaecological examination a chaperone should be available to assist with gynaecological examinations irrespective of the gender of the gynaecologist further standards verbal consent should be obtained prior to all pelvic examinations where pelvic examination under anaesthesia is regarded as being of educational value fully informed written consent must be obtained for a named medical student there is no clinical evidence to support the use of rectal examination as means of assessing the cervix in pregnancy or labour and as most women find it more distressing than vaginal examination it cannot be recommended patient focus patients should be provided with private warm and comfortable changing facilities after undressing there should be no undue delay prior to examination every effort must be made to ensure that such examinations take place in a closed room that cannot be entered while the examination is in progress and without interruption easily understood literature and diagrams should be provided for women undergoing invasive procedures such as colposcopy and urodynamic investigations
6958508 in addition to the lack of training i also have to wonder about the sensitivity of the predominantly male ob gyns when this discussion of vaginal surgery descends into car talk in a letter published in the july issue of the journal ob gyn mark vizer says
6958509 i asked a general surgeon about this and how he felt about learning to perform a vaginal hysterectomy he looked at me funny he was concerned about lack of visualization and exposure and wondered why we even did this it made as much sense to him as changing spark plugs from under the car
6958510 regarding your general surgeons comments again two questions how does he change his oil would he cut a hole in the hood of the car to get at the spark plugs or use the opening that the maker provided
6958511 so you do something harder but get paid 15 less does this make sense to you
6958512 14 of those responders who stated that being able to bill more for a transabdominal approach influenced their hysterectomy route

6958517 i had my first pap smear at age 21 i was told by the nurse practioner that i had to have one it really hurt and she was irritated with me that it was taking so long to do after she was finished she left the table and then she came back to the table where i was and she jerked my legs opened and i heard a snapping noise and thought she had popped my back she told me i was still a virgin but when i got home there was a lot of blood i walked differently and my vagina seemed to be pulled down more between my legs is all of this normal to have happened for a first time pap smear i feel like she actually raped me and that i have physically lost my virginity i am becoming very depressed
6958518 i understand too that you feel violated im sure i feel violated in your position too if you havent already i would strongly encourage you to file a formal complaint with this nps superiors and or the nursing union what she did to you is wrong at the very least she seriously lacks compassion and at most this was a serious breech of trust and abuse of power

6958529 it has nothing to do with it it is for all the people of malaysia not just for permatang pauh each time i meet reporters i keep getting asked when the prices will be reduced now i have done it and now still more questions the reduction in petrol prices is the best deal
6958530 after the world oil price started dropping it rose up again by us 5 yesterday if we were to wait until the end of the month and the price keeps going up the average price for august would be on the higher side and it will mean we will not be able to give the best reduction for the people
6958531 if it drops further we will be able to reduce some more when reviewing the matter on aug 31 this is also good for the people

6958544 that was why i think he didnt stop him because of a lack of energy but he paced himself well if he would have had a full preparation he would have stopped him

6958551 bens role was also more in mobile veterinary practice so he spent more time away from the clinic
6958552 i have an incident in my mind where i suspect it could have happened and in that particular instance that horse was normal it was before it came ill with hendra virus
6958553 the girl who got sick works in the hospital all the time and is one of our senior nurses so i think she had more opportunity
6958554 there were many many people in our clinic who were exposed to these horses on a close basis for an extended period of time and thankfully the great majority did not get infected
6958555 i have no feelings of grudge against anyone who challenges what we did

6958586 we have spent months around nevada and a lot of nevada families are struggling to put food on the table
6958587 at the same time congressman heller has lined up with the bush administration and has lined up with big oil and against nevada families
6958588 there are going to be a number of polls run before november and they are all are going to say something different
6958589 congressman heller has worked hard for nevada and will continue to focus on solutions to high fuel prices a sluggish economy and illegal immigration in the months ahead
6958590 this suggests that dean heller has some real problems with jill derby
6958591 jill derby is going to be able to run some interesting ads and she has the backing of national organizations so she has the money there is a disconnect in the republican party and all of that points to a real challenge for him
6958592 congress is not the most popular entity in u s politics
6958593 and that goes for everybody republican and democrat look at what they have done this session youd be hard pressed to seize on any significant piece of legislation it doesnt just apply to republicans it applies to democrats to harry reid to nancy pelosi
6958594 where the glass is half empty with heller is that he is an incumbent and he is under 50 percent
6958595 what that tells us is that voters are at least going to keep their ears open the fact that he is under 50 percent means that the majority of voters are not happy with the way things are going you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment subscribe

6958616 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6958617 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6958618 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6958619 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6958620 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6958621 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6958622 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6958623 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6958624 i really wanted to register voters and thats what ive done the most for the league
6958625 i think people should definitely have a voice and informed voting is one of the most important things we americans can do
6958626 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6958627 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6958628 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6958629 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6958630 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6958631 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6958632 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6958633 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6958634 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6958635 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6958636 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6958637 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6958638 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6958639 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6958640 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6958641 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6958642 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6958643 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6958644 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6958645 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6958646 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6958647 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6958648 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6958649 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6958650 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6958651 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6958652 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6958653 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6958654 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6958655 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6958656 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6958657 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6958658 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6958659 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6958660 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6958661 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6958662 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6958663 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6958664 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6958665 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6958666 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6958667 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6958668 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6958669 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6958670 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6958671 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6958672 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6958673 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6958674 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6958675 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6958676 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6958677 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6958678 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6958679 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6958680 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6958681 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6958682 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6958683 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6958684 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6958685 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6958686 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6958687 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
6958688 do your work and then step back the only path to serenity
6958689 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
6958690 there has been a narrowing down of differences between the various countries it is quite a remarkable feat that 45 different sovereign nations should decide to have one point of view over any issue
6958691 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6958692 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6958693 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6958694 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6958695 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6958696 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6958697 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6958698 who are open to doing something on the production side
6958699 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6958700 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6958701 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6958702 ratan tata has made it clear that the ball is in the states court and if the protests continue he will not think twice about pulling out even if it means a delayed entry for the nano
6958703 we were unhappy from the start about the location access was difficult and once the agitations began it was difficult to convince our people that things would settle down to a peaceful routine

6958730 prisoners are holding up two fingers to the criminal justice system and these pictures show that prison security is a shambles
6958731 it beggars belief that a convicted knife murderer would be allowed access to a potentially lethal kitchen knife

6958733 in 2007 seizures of canadian produced methamphetamine were interdicted in australia japan new zealand and to a lesser extent china taiwan india and iran the majority of the groups involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine are based in b c
6958734 violence and intimidation are used to solidify or further a crime groups involvement within a criminal market it is usually directed either externally against criminal rivals or internally within their own organization to maintain discipline
6958735 in some instances lower level criminal groups will pose a more immediate and direct public safety threat through acts of violence that are often carried out in public places these violent lower level criminal groups are largely but not entirely composed of street gangs some of which have committed assaults or shootings in public places
6958736 a small number of organized crime groups mostly based in b c and quebec are involved in the facilitation of international trafficking in persons tip it said
6958737 conversely several street gangs are active within the domestic tip market for the purposes of sexual exploitation these groups facilitate the recruitment control movement and exploitation of canadian born females in the domestic sex trade primarily in strip bars in several cities across the country
6958738 today there are more than 17 police units and government agencies actively working together to combat organized crime
6958739 but this is not just a problem for the police to solve in isolation it is a problem for the entire community to take a stand against
6958740 this figure does not include revenue from the sale of crystal meth cocaine and heroin and from identity theft credit card fraud prostitution gun smuggling human trafficking and money laundering
6958741 but even more alarming is the violent crime associated to organized crime such as shootings in public places kidnappings and the murders of innocent people
6958742 technology changes very fast and our reliance on technology is growing at a phenomenal rate
6958743 it is a challenge for us to keep up which is all the more reason why we need to collaborate more and i think this report is an example of us doing it
6958744 as we move more and more to the internet and the technology being used the risks are increasing a lot of the public are not very careful about their identity
6958745 one of the reasons why organized crime has been as successful as it is is because they are very adaptable its not as if they have given up any of their traditional markets but as new technology and as changes occur in society they are also changing and taking advantage of the areas they can exploit
6958746 sure well give him a few smacks and see what way he goes

6958764 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6958765 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6958766 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6958767 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati

6958769 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6958770 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6958771 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6958772 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6958773 this is more of the same from enda kenny the same old assortment of vacuous redundant arguments
6958774 what i find particularly risible is his suggestion that we bought the last election in each one of his three budgets brian cowen budgeted for a surplus how big does the surplus have to be before we can avoid the accusation that we bought the election
6958775 one of enda kennys distinguishing marks as a politician is that he never stoops to name calling
6958776 i suspect that he prays to god to send him a time machine to whisk him back to may 8 and a chance to start all over
6958777 his government is in disarray shocked to the core by the changing economic fortunes of the country he has lost a crucial referendum and has to brace himself for an almost certain defeat in the dublin south by election
6958778 some of those who were convinced he had the right mix of personal qualities now say the exact opposite they mumble now that the poor soul is the victim of events beyond his control
6958779 the gop is a political organization that has already consumed nearly all of its moderate

6958787 within three quarters of an hour of landing in hong kong word came through that there had been a positive test for an irish horse
6958788 we have no choice because testing is monitored by the individual bodies neither ourselves nor the
6958789 the subject is so complex its beyond our expertise but we are now launching our own investigation into this case with horse sport ireland

6958825 i know i made a bad decision on my behalf not bringing this to the attention of the fire chief
6958826 i was truly concerned for the three employees families their careers and in general their livelihood most of all i was concerned about the publicity this would have brought to the township the chief and myself
6958827 i plead with you to please consider this one decision i made over two years ago not to control my destiny

6958830 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre august 7 position as agreed
6958831 it is imperative that russian forces fully and speedily implement and abide by the commitments that it has made

6958837 most people consume as much as 25 percent of their total caloric intake from snacks
6958838 if we could replace snacks high in refined carbohydrates with just 1 4 to 1 3 cup of nuts per day we could have a positive impact on nutrient density and the risk of chronic disease
6958839 this is significant in two ways one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of embryo derived stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6958840 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6958841 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

6958857 thats not exactly the guy hamilton you want to face as the tying run
6958858 we threw him all fastballs changing them up between two and four seamers we wanted to keep his eye moving we didnt want him to extend his hands on the 3 2 pitch if i was going to miss i would miss in we didnt want to give him a chance to hit it out of the park
6958859 it was big for us to tack on runs there
6958860 in this park a one run lead is not enough its never over until the last out is made
6958861 what happened was he got ahead of cabrera with two strikes then cabrera made him throw a ton of pitches
6958862 they did a good job of working him fouling off pitches i just thought they hit some good pitches hes only human
6958863 i didnt make the adjustment until the third inning and by then id given up five runs i need to start out by keeping the ball down i just want to be consistent you dont want one bad one good its very disappointing

6958873 this placement allows us to expand the work program on the rogers creek porphyry copper gold property in response to early results which indicate the presence of sizable alteration zones along with elevated gold and copper values while it is too early to be able to fully evaluate the significance of the early results this placement will allow us to expand the program to complete this evaluation we are pleased to be able to accelerate our work program at a time when many other companies are curtailing theirs we will continue our philosophy of aggressive exploration while tailoring the size of placements to the immediate needs of our programs in order to minimize dilution during this period of relatively low valuations in the junior mining sector
6958874 progress with the constancia feasibility study has been very encouraging this has been complimented by the successful infill drilling at constancia which will be completed after a 25 tonne bulk metallurgical sample has been taken by drilling based on our latest projections we believe the potential exists for a material increase in the constancia resource which will contribute to an extension of the projected mine life beyond fifteen years
6958875 in addition to the impressive progress with the definitive feasibility study norsemont has completed the acquisition of the surface rights over four commercial farms at constancia this is of significant strategic benefit to the company as it provides us flexibility in relation to the location of the surface infrastructure although we enjoy good relations with the two communities in the vicinity of constancia ownership of the private surface rights enables us to minimize the impact on these communities
6958876 we have also been successful in increasing our mineral property position at constancia from the original 5 140 hectares to over 20 000 hectares as we have completed infill drilling at constancia we have now relocated a number of our drill rigs to a newly discovered anomaly to the south east of constancia where drilling is currently underway based on recent exploration success we believe the potential exists to increase the constancia copper resource to between 600 million and 800 million tonnes which would significantly increase the constancia mine life

6958884 obama has opened up more offices in rural areas than any other democratic presidential candidate in years
6958885 most washington politicians think rural america is a place you fly over on your way from new york to california
6958886 senator obama understands the challenges facing families in rural iowa because he is from the heartland and has held more than 100 town hall meetings across the state senator obama is the only candidate who will truly fight to strengthen our family farms and rural communities and bring real change to washington

6958933 to be very honest theres no special feeling at all given the position of the game at that time and my innings i was thinking only about the 100
6958934 i knew that six fours in an over dont happen often but i was not seriously concerned about it i was just playing by instinct trying to stay positive and at one stage ganga walked up and said i had hit five fours
6958935 even after that i didnt tell myself that another four off the last ball which turned out to be a no ball would make it special i was thinking about being positive against patel because he is the kind of a bowler who gets the better of you if you let him get on top

6958940 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6958941 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6958942 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6958943 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6958944 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group
6958945 hes our engine he made a mistake early in the game but he came right back at it
6958946 we made too many mistakes and we have to be able to throw the ball
6958947 logan is going to be our hammer and we tried that but we have to back them out of there with some throws
6958948 you get him in your sights and get him in our grasp and the defense works so hard to get to him and he sidesteps you and makes us look like dummies at times
6958949 they had some nice long drives and that is offense at its finest
6958950 our nose guard made a heck of a play caused a fumble and we got the ball on the 7 yard line
6958951 i felt a whole lot better when we got up by two touchdowns
6958952 he just made plays and kept us in the game
6958953 we set a goal at the beginning of the summer that we would be 1 0 this year and its been a long time since 2004 since the bath wildcats have been 1 0
6958954 weve made so many improvements on this football team from the offensive line to our running backs to our defensive backs to our defensive line weve had massive improvements and im just proud of the entire team
6958955 it feels great i didnt even know i was going to play on the varsity
6958956 i like it all i like the contact the running everybody hitting me i love it
6958957 hes a special kid and has a lot of raw talent this is just natural ability that he has and i look forward to him getting better and better through his career
6958958 it takes off the pressure were a nice one two punch
6958959 were very disappointed on the defensive side of the ball in the first half
6958960 i dont think we saw anything we hadnt prepared for we thought they had two good backs we just didnt come out ready to play
6958961 last year we were 2 8 before that 3 7
6958962 its been a long time since anyone said the bath wildcats are 1 0
6958963 they are used to man blocking and not used to zone blocking so it might take awhile
6958964 we wanted to get quarterback sam maag loose so he could do some things
6958965 you cannot make those kinds of mistakes and beat a good football team
6958966 i thought our defense played pretty well it came down to offensive execution and special teams
6958967 we started out the way we wanted to but then we fumbled the ball and got nothing
6958968 we made a lot of mistakes seven fumbles and are still working out the kinks with these young kids
6958969 after their first drive or two our defense played very well it was weyers first varsity game and we blitzed him a lot

6958980 i thought we did a lot of good things as an offense but i made a couple of poor throws toward the end of the first half
6958981 we were able to come out and score at the beginning of the third quarter and that was a good way to end it
6958982 i think he played well and he handled himself well against a good defense
6958983 we have to buckle down and improve before we get into the regular season

6958995 its been a rash obviously it wasnt a good road trip going 1 8 it wasnt entirely the injuries fault i dont want to point to injuries we didnt pitch good enough to win those games we didnt play good enough defense and we didnt hit good enough
6958996 it will be my fourth in four weeks once we see that we will see how much healing its done and go from there

6959092 when i started doing the agricultural work like picking cotton
6959093 one day it was kinda slow and i told the cook i been watching you lemme do a hotdog and he said ok come on do it so i prepared an artful hot dog stuck it up in the window tapped the bell and stepped back watched the waitress deliver it the guy ate it and it was cool i started doing some catfish some hamburger steak and the guy loved it i eventually began doing a little short order cook stuff

6959107 the passenger would receive an acknowledgement message from the rta and a taxi would pick the passenger up from the exact spot within minutes
6959108 if a passenger does not find a cab at any of the stands he she can also call up any of the dispatch centres of any taxi company and give the rank number to the customer service agent
6959109 the rta will track the nearest taxi and give the driver the message the gps meter system in the taxis will have the information about all rank numbers and the locations the driver will not have to search for a particular location and could reach the exact spot easily
6959110 the people will be informed about the rank numbers and locations through media campaigns
6959111 there is no fixed number of taxis for each rank the driver who is the nearest would be contacted and asked to go to the particular stand taxis would also be waiting for passengers at some stands like in the shopping malls hotels etc
6959112 i had not got taxis even after booking them over the phone on several occasions this system can help mitigate the current situation moreover with five dispatch numbers in place people can now heave a sigh of relief
6959113 the system sounds good but some areas are very large how will a person reach any of the taxi stands in the area the rta must now increase the number of taxi stands from where passengers could board the big areas should have more stands
6959114 many taxi drivers dont attend to the messages some dont go to the passengers even after receiving the messages the rta should end this practice introduction of more dispatch numbers is welcome with only one number earlier people had to wait for a long time to get through the number
6959115 i knew that i was up on the judges scorecards
6959116 i threw a cross to ndlovus stomach but it went below the belt

6959137 i havent spent my political life hanging around the state corridors that have produced our dysfunctional government tracey brooks has tried first as republican then as a member of the independence party paul tonko has represented you for a long time and hes part of the state assembly dysfunction system
6959138 everybody is fed up with republicans and democrats they simply want a change
6959139 change hasnt come in washington and theres really one core reason why its because lobbyists and special interests have really controlled the game down there
6959140 in the case of tracey brooks targeting women when youre running against a number of men certain is the kind of political strategy that works
6959141 i just felt she was the best able to deal with the things of concern i find that are important at this time
6959142 i dont know the others to be frank too well those are all competent people
6959143 however when you have a woman an individual who can compete with each of these people im one of those people who feel strongly about getting the voices of women heard in congress and the white house someday

6959146 they respect his intelligence his dedication and his work ethic pauls record of public service is outstanding as a member of the assembly he led the fight to hire state employees rather than waste taxpayer dollars on costly private contractors he helped prevent violence in the workplace and has fought to preserve vital state facilities and services we enthusiastically support paul tonko for congress
6959147 i want to thank the public employees federation for their continued support
6959148 we have built a long standing partnership working together to solve important issues that impact not just pef members but all new yorkers the wealth of professional and technical services provided by pef members not only guarantees a scientific response to our most difficult problems but it also enhances our quality of life

6959190 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6959191 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6959192 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6959193 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6959194 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6959195 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6959196 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6959197 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6959198 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6959199 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6959200 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6959201 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6959202 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family
6959203 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6959204 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6959205 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
6959206 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
6959207 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6959208 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6959209 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
6959210 normal i dont even count its obviously not 120 or 160 so its normal
6959211 we dont know but im thinking yes as we have 3 already
6959212 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009
6959213 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6959214 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6959215 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
6959216 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
6959217 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
6959218 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
6959219 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
6959220 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
6959221 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
6959222 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
6959223 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6959224 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no
6959225 i didnt want to wake you and i never know when youre working
6959226 yeah we carry it i dont know where anything is im not the sharpest knife in the drawer you know that but i do come to work every day you gotta give me that

6959236 i thought in the first quarter we played very well
6959237 we moved the ball quickly and didnt get squeezed into corners

6959360 ive never seen that happen like that im glad it did happen that way just like we wrote it up
6959361 we checked on the tape and saw i didnt get a big enough lead
6959362 that would have given me a better opportunity when i saw rodney with the ball i tried to avoid him
6959363 it didnt look like he had to go right or left it sometimes dies back there its my backstop so i know but it hit the post it literally cut down 15 20 feet which that is what he got thrown out by

6959372 and i knew that it was going to probably lead to one thing or another
6959373 and hes got to make the decision for this club and right now you cant feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i mean i dont feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i know i have better stuff than that if i dont have anything to throw off of that fastball then im in trouble
6959374 throughout my career and especially when it comes to situational pitching ive always felt like when ive had my legit slider which is my out pitch ive felt like i could get out of anything
6959375 and this year for whatever reason its just been inconsistent off and on
6959376 i think the biggest thing is getting my stuff back to where it needs to be because its not the same the hit totals and what lefties are doing against me this year pretty much reveal that

6959479 haur literaturako ipuinek hartu dute komikigintzak haurrentzat izan duen lekua
6959480 gaur egun haurrentzako ipuin asko argitaratzen da eta komikigintza aldiz gaztetxo eta gazteentzako gelditu da baina bereziki super heroien komikia eta manga kontsumitzen duten gazteentzat era horretako komikigintza kanpotik dator ez da hemen egiten horregatik bertako produkzioan oinarritutako euskarazko komiki bat egitea oso abentura zaila da eta ez dut uste inork hartuko duenik ereinen lekukoa

6959530 wahai rasulullah orang orang kaya telah memborong pahala mereka bisa shalat sebagaimana kami shalat mereka bisa berpuasa sebagaimana kami berpuasa bahkan mereka bisa bersedekah dengan kelebihan harta mereka
6959531 bukankah allah telah memberikan kepada kalian sesuatu yang bisa kalian sedekahkan pada tiap tiap ucapan tasbih terdapat sedekah pada tiap tiap ucapan takbir terdapat sedekah pada tiap tiap ucapan tahlil terdapat sedekah pada tiap tiap ucapan tahmid terdapat sedekah memerintahkan perbuatan baik adalah sedekah mencegah perbuatan munkar adalah sedekah dan kalian bersetubuh dengan istri pun sedekah
6959532 wahai rasulullah kok bisa salah seorang dari kami melampiaskan syahwatnya akan mendapatkan pahala
6959533 bagaimana menurut kalian bila nafsu syahwatnya itu dia salurkan pada tempat yang haram apakah dia akan mendapatkan dosa dengan sebab perbuatannya itu
6959534 demikian pula bila dia salurkan syahwatnya itu pada tempat yang halal dia pun akan mendapatkan pahala
6959535 semua itu bisa digantikan cukup dengan shalat dua rakaat dhuha
6959536 siapa saja yang pertama memberi contoh perilaku yang baik dalam islam maka ia mendapatkan pahala kebaikannya dan mendapatkan pahala orang orang yang meniru perbuatannya itu tanpa dikurangi sedikit pun dan barang siapa yang pertama memberi contoh perilaku jelek dalam islam maka ia mendapatkan dosa kejahatan itu dan mendapatkan dosa orang yang meniru perbuatannya tanpa dikurangi sedikit pun
6959537 satu dinar yang kamu nafkahkan di jalan allah satu dinar yang kamu nafkahkan untuk memerdekakan budak satu dinar yang kamu berikan kepada orang miskin dan satu dinar yang kamu nafkahkan kepada keluargamu maka yang paling besar pahalanya yaitu satu dinar yang kamu nafkahkan kepada keluargamu

6959540 sesungguhnya apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan dengan maksud kamu mencari keridhaan allah niscaya kamu akan diberi pahala sampai apa saja yang kamu sediakan untuk istrimu
6959541 seseorang cukup dianggap berdosa apabila ia menyianyiaka orang yang harus diberi belanja
6959542 dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka allah akan menggantinya

6959559 saya mendengar rasulullah bersabda allah telah menulis ketentuan seluruh makhluk sebelum menciptakan langit dan bumi selang waktu lima puluh ribu tahun
6959560 kalau menghendaki tentu dia memberi kekuasaan kepada mereka terhadap kamu lalu pastilah mereka memerangimu
6959561 jikalau tuhanmu menghendaki niscaya mereka tidak mengerjakannya maka tinggalkanlah mereka dan apa yang mereka ada adakan
6959562 dan dialah menciptakan segala sesuatu dan menetapkan ukuran ukurannya dengan serapi rapinya
6959563 maka barangsiapa siapa menghendaki niscaya ia menempuh jalan kembali kepada tuhannya
6959564 isteri isterimu adalah seperti tanah tempat kamu bercocok tanam maka datangilah tanah tempat bercocok tanammu itu bagaimana saja kamu kehendaki
6959565 maka bertaqwalah kamu kepada allah menurut kesanggupanmu dan dengarlah serta taatlah
6959566 allah tidak membebani seseorang melainkan sesuai dengan kesanggupannya ia mendapat pahata dari kebajikan yang diusahakannya dan ia mendapat siksa dari kejahatan yang dikerjakannya
6959567 yaitu bagi siapa di antara kamu yang mau menempuh jalan yang lurus dan kamu tidak dapat menghendaki menempuh jalan itu kecuali apabila dikehendaki allah tuhan semesta alam
6959568 orang orang yang mempersekutukan tuhan akan mengatakan jika allah menghendaki niscaya kami dan bapak bapak kami tidak mempersekutukan nya dan tidak pula kami mengharamkan barang sesuatu apa pun
6959569 mereka kami utus selaku rasul rasul pembawa berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan supaya tidak ada alasan bagi manusia membantah allah sesudah diutusnya rasul rasul itu dan adalah allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
6959570 setiap orang dari kalian telah ditentukan tempatnya di surga atau di neraka seseorang bertanya kenapa kita tidak pasrah saja wahai rasulullah beliau menjawab jangan akan tetapi berbuatlah karena masing masing akan dimudahkan
6959571 tiada suatu musibahpun yang menimpa di bumi dan tidak pula pada dirmu sendiri melainkan telah tertulis dalam kitab lauh mahfuzh sebelum kami menciptakannya sesungguhnya yang demikian itu adalah mudah bagi allah kami jelaskan yang demikian itu supaya kamu jangan berduka cita terhadap apa yang luput dari kamu dan supaya kamu jangan terlalu gembira terhadap apa yang diberikan kepadamu dan allah tidak menyukai setiap orang yang sombong lagi membanggakan diri

6959668 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat kepada rupa dan amal amal kalian tapi sesungguhnya allah melihat kepada hati dan niat niat kalian
6959669 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya di dalam tubuh ini ada segumpal daging jika ia baik maka baiklah seluruh tubuh dan jika ia rusak maka rusaklah seluruh tubuh ketahuilah itulah hati
6959670 sesungguhnya hati itu lebih cepat berbolak balik daripada makanan yang sedang mendidih dalam periuk
6959671 wahai tuhan yang maha membolak balikkan hati tetapkanlah hatiku pada agama mu
6959672 sesungguhnya hati itu terletak antara dua jari dari jari jari ar rahman jika dia berkehendak diluruskannya atau jika dia berkehendak yang lain dibengkokkannya
6959673 dan janganlah engkau hinakan aku pada hari mereka dibangkitkan pada hari dimana harta dan anak anak tidak berguna kecuali orang orang yang menghadap allah dengan hati yang selamat
6959674 wahai tuhan kami janganlah engkau sesatkan hati hati kami setelah engkau memberikan kami hidayah dan limpahkanlah kepada kami rahmat dari sisi mu sesungguhnya engkau adalah yang maha pemberi

6959725 ive grown a lot as a person and an athlete the past few years and its become my obsession i guess so its cool that its worked out
6959726 it started with just going to the olympics i was just a young athlete and it was a tough eye opening experience
6959727 i just got bundled out really early in the qualifying round but i got a chance to sit back and watch all the guys that made the final and i thought that i could be as good or better than those guys
6959728 i was part of tims preparation for that hes a good friend of mine and i got to witness what he did in the lead up competitions what he did around the village and what he did in his qualifying and in the final
6959729 he was so mentally tough he hadnt won that competition until he jumped that five metres 95 to break the olympic record he was behind the whole competition and i took a lot from that
6959730 he just stuck to his plan stuck to what he knew and hes been in my thoughts a lot the past couple of days
6959731 i saw him during the qualifying round he was sitting front row and i saw him after i had my third attempt clearance at 5 65 and he gave me a big smile and a thumbs up and i really took that with me and i wanted to replicate what he did four years ago and im really happy that i did
6959732 that definitely hasnt sunk in because im still the same guy i was yesterday i still havent slept so i havent had the chance to wake up and be someone new i guess
6959733 i thought my third attempt at five metres 85 was really dicey i thought id missed that to be honest i was going off to the side but i finished the jump anyway i count my lucky stars i cleared that
6959734 it wasnt the best jump id done all night and neither was my third attempt at 80 but those lucky clearances meant that i put together really good jumps at 90 and 96
6959735 i took a moment before i jumped at 5 90 and sat back and realised i was doing something that every kid dreams of i had my destiny in my own hands
6959736 russian rival evgeny lukyanenko was out of the competition if i clear that bar i am olympic gold medallist and i did think i was the sort of person who could stand up and take that sort of opportunity on and make the most of it
6959737 sailing over that bar it was a clean clearance i really got to enjoy it
6959738 i knew i was over it thats the good thing about my event you get that opportunity to fall to earth and thats an experience that no other people get to have in their events so im lucky to be a pole vaulter lucky to be an olympic gold medallist lucky to be an australian all sorts of things im a very lucky guy right now
6959739 so much time so much planning and so much effort so many sacrifices so much has gone into this for me there have been so many people supporting me through all of this this is not just for me this is for all of them its an amazing feeling and i hope theyre all feeling half as amazing as i am
6959740 its a really cool thing i feel like i deserve this and im going to enjoy it i love what i do and this is just icing on the cake
6959741 my whole thing at the moment is just about relaxing you know my best jumps are when im relaxed
6959742 i wasnt that relaxed at the start of the competition i was pushing too hard on the runway and i just really needed to let it go and as the competition went on i got more tired and i just had to do that otherwise i wouldnt have survived
6959743 one of my big changes for me is that i didnt think about the consequences of missing or clearing i was just in the moment for it i didnt think about the interviews i would have to do if i missed and came fifth at the olympics and thats something that in the past i have worried about
6959744 i loved being in a bit of a dogfight with evgeny i loved having third attempt clearances i loved it all being on the line

6959809 the really important part is not the vehicle students built it is the experience that can change your life
6959810 it is a good life experience any endeavor the bottom line is it requires collaboration
6959811 it is hard to teach this in a formal classroom
6959812 the national statistics for students graduating in science and engineering programs are dismal
6959813 this encourages kids with hands on opportunities in math and science and increases that pool of talent that we at the naval center have to work with
6959814 shes totally dependent for all of her care on someone other than herself
6959815 i dont think my daughter would be as old as she is if she was in another facility
6959816 dont you think we as parents would have loved to see her in a group home if we thought she was physically able to go
6959817 if their assessment shows that the care they need can only be provided in a nursing facility then theyll stay at a nursing facility
6959818 they have to find 640 people to fill those slots
6959819 our concern is that when they get to our people whether or not its appropriate theyre going to railroad these people into community placements
6959820 we certainly dont force people but we do work with them to transfer them into the community
6959821 the cognitive limitation already implies that theres no way that they can benefit from being in smaller group homes
6959822 and medically theyre so fragile that a group home cannot have the kind of depth of coverage that their nursing home has
6959823 the state is very inhumanely forcing us to live with that threat over our heads
6959824 our only protection is that we can appeal if we dont like their decision which doesnt seem like a very secure position to be in
6959825 how can they determine what is best for my child if they dont know her from a hole in the wall
6959826 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6959827 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6959828 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6959829 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6959830 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6959831 i spent the first year just trying to get the kids to ask questions
6959832 come follow me jesus said and i will make you fishers of men
6959833 we spent the year trying to be and living all those things and it took on a life of its own
6959834 every single kid caught a fish we had a wonderful time
6959835 now we had to go out and fish for men
6959836 my hook was that we were going to build a boat one really nice boat
6959837 we laid out all the boxes and never thought we would actually get this thing to be a 15 foot boat
6959838 i started to get calls from people who didnt have kids in sunday school
6959839 two older men offered to take on the project dick daniels and larry bedell
6959840 thurston sails in bristol made us the sail using the specs we had
6959841 it is a beautiful blue to match the inside of the boat
6959842 from that point on they were making the boat for a specific person or family
6959843 debey always wore bright colors so they painted the inside of the boat caribbean blue
6959844 it was a beautiful sunny day with great wind for sailing
6959845 we invited everybody and everything fell into place the boat just flew the kids said thats because we were doing the work of god
6959846 i was really nervous there were a lot of people watching and i never realized how tough it is to play in a final like this
6959847 we were pretty consistent with our putting all week we didnt have a lot of three putts and that was a key in match play it all comes down to putting thats how you win holes
6959848 courtney had been hitting the ball past me all day so i took it for granted that it was her ball further down the fairway
6959849 for some reason i just didnt check the ball to be sure
6959850 i really didnt think i had hit my ball that far and i turned out to be right its unfortunate that something like that had to happen but the correct ruling was made and we went on with the match
6959851 it was a long match but both teams were ready to play as long as it took winning means a lot to me my grandmother irene teser loved this tournament she passed away when i was 2 and i know she would have been proud of me today
6959852 joann played great today and that was big because it wasnt my best round
6959853 it was our first time playing together in this tournament and we got the job done when we had to
6959854 it was really a gift from heaven this morning mr fernandes doesnt live in freetown but he likes the town and wants to help
6959855 part of our business is to give back to worthy causes
6959856 we are in the computer business and when i called this morning it doesnt sound like they have anything too extravagant we want to get them back up to where they were before and perhaps even enhance what they had
6959857 it is important to have everything there for the kids my mother used to take me to the projects on thanksgiving so i could see that not all children have access to the same things i did it is my philosophy that if every business did something to help the community it could make a big difference
6959858 it was something i was going to do for about six months
6959859 when i was coming up in dogs i had people who helped me
6959860 the older ones are like the swallows that come back to capistrano
6959861 its the most important thing that we do for them
6959862 engage youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development
6959863 they arent just standing out in the middle of the ring by themselves
6959864 it benefits every child in new bedford who wants to interact and play with their peers regardless of ability or physical limitations
6959865 families who wish to enjoy a picnic or day in the park dont have to make special accommodations for a child with a disability there is something for everyone to enjoy
6959866 the result is a place where children of all abilities can play together in years past children in wheelchairs could only sit and watch their friends and siblings as outsiders to conform with ada regulations and facilitate wheelchair travel safety surfacing has been installed by the structure and adaptive swings

6959868 good evening my name is cara winslow and i live in east wareham my husband and i moved here in the spring of 2004 when we bought our first home all my life i have had family in wareham and the memories drew me back to a place i loved a place i wanted to raise a family
6959869 i am aware of the budget crisis that is rooted in a local receipts shortfall from fiscal year 2008 of approximately 800 000
6959870 i understand that the state department of revenue gets very concerned about any shortfalls in prior year local revenue and forces towns to not only fund the prior year deficit with fy09 cuts but to also reduce the fy09 revenue by an amount approximately equal to the prior year local revenue deficit
6959871 given the close ties that the prior town administrator and current interim town administrator have with the department of revenue and the very conservative estimates for local receipts in the fy09 budget i would like to know if any conversations with dor have taken place to potentially reduce the fy09 revenue reductions and therefore the expense cuts necessary to balance the budget
6959872 the most important point i would like to make is that i believe as we go forward needing to resolve the deficit i would hope that the leadership of wareham will make every effort to collaborate with every department including our school administration and where possible the citizens most directly impacted by the proposed changes to accomplish such a task with the least adverse affect on town services available to the citizens
6959873 a 10 percent cut in the budgets of some discretionary departments a much larger cut in legal expenses along with much smaller percentage cuts in public safety operations i
6959874 in closing i would like to say that we are talking about some very serious issues the education of our children the jobs of many who have given of themselves to provide service to our community the safety of the public as a whole along with a whole host of amenities that many people seriously consider when they decide to live in a community
6959875 no one could have predicted the severe downturn in our economy which struck most by surprise no one could have predicted the skyrocketing price of fuel and food but we can predict how this situation will turn out by taking careful and cautious measures by leaving no stone unturned and by ensuring that a collaborative effort is made
6959876 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6959877 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6959878 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6959879 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6959880 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6959881 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6959882 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6959883 i remain deeply concerned that russian forces have not withdrawn to the pre aug 7 position as agreed
6959884 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6959885 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6959886 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6959887 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6959888 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6959889 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6959890 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6959891 the fed needs to raise interest rates now slowly and predictably to restore confidence in its continued commitment to price stability
6959892 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6959893 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6959894 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6959895 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6959896 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6959897 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6959898 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6959899 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
6959900 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6959901 we will have to see what other issues were present
6959902 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6959903 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6959904 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometers 19 miles away i want to be with them
6959905 they really want to go home so they can get on with their lives
6959906 that is the way they will best deal with this situation
6959907 he thought it was a movie and asked where his father was and when the movie would end
6959908 theres a lot about rocket science thats been figured out but forests are subject to the intricate web of life the interactions of plants animals sun air you name it
6959909 they dont often think about their land and actively make plans for it because on a day to day basis it meets their needs
6959910 when that dust settles in 20 or 30 years well see what we have left in terms of forests and what ecosystem benefits they still provide
6959911 we bought it because we really believed that rather than being developed it should be open land for us and others to enjoy
6959912 were happy with what weve done and we think it was the right thing to do in terms of helping the environment

6959914 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6959915 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil
6959916 the academy served this part of the state and we need something like that here
6959917 we shouldnt be traveling because the cities and towns have to pay for it and were all running a little short of money
6959918 if the state has to cut back on something there are other things they can go after to save money
6959919 they should never backtrack when it comes to public safety
6959920 obviously its a budget issue but i hope there is money to be found somewhere i assume the mayor will go to the governor on this issue
6959921 by joining our resources i believe we can assemble an in service program that would serve the entire region new bedford is not willing to compromise on police training
6959922 itll have no impact on the citizens of the city and no impact on the level of training that our officers have
6959923 the officers will be trained as they always have the mandated training will be done and in our collective bargaining agreement officers can get up to 10 days of certified training hopefully that translates into professional confident police officers

6959926 does not mandate that the sheriff physically confine all offenders within the four walls of the house of correction for the entire length of the committed portions of their sentences
6959927 to the contrary the statutory scheme confers on the sheriff the authority to permit certain eligible inmates to participate in a variety of programs outside the correctional facility
6959928 the gps program by releasing a committed offender into his own home thus exceeds the sheriffs authority under governing law
6959929 with the exception of someone who is doing life with parole all inmates are going to come back to our community and its best for us to be able to see how they operate with some checks and balances in that community before we in fact release them back into that community
6959930 youve got to be the right kind of inmate to move along you have to have a job a residence to live in and youve got to continue your therapeutic treatment

6959932 we work closely with our law enforcement and public safety partner agencies to identify emergency vehicles in advance for access to secure areas
6959933 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6959934 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6959935 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6959936 the severity of fishing restrictions which could cause more negative impacts on the groundfish fishery
6959937 i remain convinced that retaining the shorter time line will likely have a negative economic impact on the fishing industry in the region
6959938 fails to address the fundamental issues about which we wrote
6959939 committed to working with the council and the industry to continue to find ways to maximize harvests
6959940 shown the value of closed areas as a management tool

6959977 i think that theres been phone calls from people driving down 281 here asking about the baby buffalo they think its a baby buffalo but its not its just a goat
6959978 they butt heads and i think the goat thinks hes just as tough as the buffalo hes not scared when he does it i think the buffalo is a little lenient on him because he could really throw him if he wanted to
6959979 i tried to separate the two put the goat in a smaller pen and the buffalo took the fence out so the goat could get out
