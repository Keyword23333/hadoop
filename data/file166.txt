1660000 the whole country is after cricket but i am little bit against the game because i think the popularity of cricket has declined the standard of olympic sports in the country
1660001 you guys are the ones talking about it im not
1660002 after lighting it my mind went blank and then i just wanted to hurry up running ahead
1660003 this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people
1660004 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1660005 its not just about the sport its about the image of china

1660010 allen stern allen suggests that when friendfeeders see the content they should go back to the original post comment there and then have their comment pulled back into friendfeed i still dont agree with centralizing comments on the blog post or any one place and heres why by keeping comments distributed or decentralized more than one discussion is able to take place new ideas are likely to be heard since readers often start with a blank slate and are more likely to participate discussions also take different directions depending on where the conversation starts in contrast with centralization a post usually consists of a stream of comments which may or may not be directed to one another many just congratulating the author on writing a great post in other words many blog comments end up being just that comments real discussions have been taking place im not saying this cant happen on the blog post it can but it happens on friendfeed more often and with ease however thanks to services like intense debate commenting on blog posts has never been easier and many readers love it feedback quantity now think about the reach of friendfeed and how one persons like or comment pulls it into their friends stream and if those friends like it etc and so on the potential audience is enormous i have 217 people subscribed to me in friendfeed and thats probably nowhere near the top think of the implications of that friendfeed is becoming an increasingly larger portion of decentralized comments aggregated discussions i believe the solution is aggregated discussions not centralized comments if you look below youll see the friendfeed comments plugin installed it allows me to pull in comments made in friendfeed onto my posts readers can also directly comment and or like the post from my blog straight into friendfeed there is no perfect solution yet of course there is still much integration and aggregation to do the friendfeed comments plugin only pulls comments from the blog entry and not del icio us links or the disqus comments what does that mean for the blogger in the words of if you love your blog set it free
1660011 if youre looking for trouble you came to the right place if youre lookin for trouble just look right in my face
1660012 i would like to offer my greetings to the peoples republic of china the organizers and the athletes participating in the forthcoming olympic games in beijing
1660013 right from the time of chinas application to hold the olympic games i have supported chinas right to host the games this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people these games should contribute to promoting the olympic spirit of friendship openness and peace
1660014 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of the event
1660015 there is an open threat from these tibetan activists they would try every possible means to barge into the embassy but we are fully prepared and would take immediate action if anyone is found loitering around the embassy area
1660016 both parties agreed that the issue of reinstating the sacked judges could easily be resolved once they succeeded in getting rid of president musharraf
1660017 discussions were held in a very cordial manner and were very positive frank and productive
1660018 major progress was made as broad consensus emerged on key issues
1660019 the mood of the people is generally upbeat and they are excited we have pasted poster all over the town and we are receiving calls people want to show their voice
1660020 we are disappointed with the beijing olympic committee they are disappointed but they havent lost their hope and aspirations they are waiting for the ngos to do something
1660021 we have learnt she is not participating after failing a dope test
1660022 tomorrow i am supposed to be tested in beijing if that turns positive everyone can shoot me
1660023 they sai took four urine samples from her in the last two months and we got a report today saying she tested positive
1660024 it does not even say which sample tested positive and for what substance the report itself is flimsy
1660025 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1660026 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar thats not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1660027 its a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1660028 right from the time of chinas application to hold the olympic games i have supported chinas right to host the games
1660029 this is a moment of great pride to the 1

1660031 we have four major grand slams in a year for other athletes here it is almost do or die we will give it all we have got but in two weeks time there is the us open
1660032 the medal was the biggest highlight of my career and i feel a bit of a veteran here we play as individuals most of the year and so it is a huge highlight to be in a team and feel that team spirit
1660033 after wimbledon i didnt give myself a lot of chance of playing here or at the us open
1660034 i had a week and a half of hitting in sydney and took it day to day i wasnt going to commit until i was sure that it wouldnt flare up
1660035 not being seeded a lot depends on the draw i consider myself one of the most dangerous floaters if i get through one or two matches i will just get better
1660036 we have learnt she is not participating after failing a dope test
1660037 tomorrow i am supposed to be tested in beijing if that turns positive everyone can shoot me
1660038 they sai took four urine samples from her in the last two months and we got a report today saying she tested positive
1660039 it does not even say which sample tested positive and for what substance the report itself is flimsy

1660041 we received a letter from the union home ministry signed by home secretary mr madhukar gupta stating that the centre is ready to hold a meeting with the gjmm on the gorkhaland issue we appreciate and welcome the centres move
1660042 we are prepared to attend the tripartite meeting on gorkhaland but no date has been mentioned in the letter from the centre since the gorkhaland demand is a political one we request that talks on the matter should be held at a political level
1660043 i wrote a letter to gjm chief bimal gurung requesting him to bring back normalcy in darjeeling especially during the months of october and november which coincides with the festivals of durga puja and he said thousands of tourists including foreigners visit darjeeling every year during the festive season
1660044 we want all tourists to have a safe holiday in the hills for that i earnestly seek cooperation from the gjm leader to ensure that a proper environment is maintained in the entire district of darjeeling

1660048 nu vei mai veni decat daca iti voi oferi ceva iti ofer tot ceea ce am
1660049 din pacate nu am bani aceasta este o inventie a oamenilor noi copacii nu avem bani in schimb suntem fericiti crengile noastre se umplu de flori apoi de fructe umbra noastra ii racoreste pe cei incalziti cand bate vantul dansam si cantam desi nu avem bani pasarelele se cuibaresc pe ramurile noastre si ciripesc vesele daca ne am implica si noi in afaceri financiare am deveni la fel de inraiti si de nefericiti ca voi oamenii care sunteti nevoiti sa stati prin temple si sa ascultati predici despre iubire si despre pace noi nu avem nevoie de predici caci traim tot timpul aceste stari nu noi nu avem nevoie de bani

1660055 ce mai pot face pentru tine ai venit dupa foarte foarte mult timp
1660056 ce poti face pentru mine as vrea sa ajung intr o tara indepartata sa castig si mai multi bani pentru asta am nevoie de o barca

1660070 daca vorbim punctual nici macar in turcia nu exista mall uri in mijlocul orasului caci galleries la fayette din paris sau el corte ingles din barcelona nu sunt mall uri dar la noi sunt si intentia unora este sa le intinda pana chiar in preajma ateneului sub privirile prostite ale unei majoritati ce isi pierde vremea cu privitul la televizor video un interviu in imagini

1660075 the scottish fa is at the heart of the game here in scotland
1660076 we have seen so much improvement in our national team in recent years our club sides have flown the flag for our country in europe and our mens and womens national teams have risen up the world rankings there is a genuine sense of optimism about our future and this deal only adds to it
1660077 our first scottish fa deal was in 1989 and the various renewals over the years make this the longest running rights partnership in the history of sky sports
1660078 we started with internationals and the odd scottish cup game and in recent years this has been developed to include under 21 games
1660079 we are delighted that this depth of coverage will continue and sky will continue to support the game in scotland at all levels
1660080 were delighted to extend our long partnership with the scottish fa this enhanced package with extra live tv games from 2010 represents an excellent deal and is great news for football fans especially in a period of significant inflation in the price of uk sports rights

1660108 in keinem von der deutschen wehrmacht besetzten land war der holocaust effektiver und industrieller organisiert als in ungarn die j dische bev lkerung im besetzten budapest war f r die deportation und vernichtung bestimmt und war opfer schrecklichster verfolgungsma nahmen die anerkennung dieses leids ist eine bedeutende l ngst berf llige geste an die berlebenden aus budapest
1660109 die zahlungen bedeuten eine historische anerkennung der schrecklichen erfahrungen der j dischen bev lkerung in budapest w hrend der ns besetzung die j dische bev lkerung litt unter hunger verfolgung krankheit und war das ziel von t dlichen bergriffen durch die nazis und durch die ungarische polizei und banden auch wenn diese zahlungen das leid der berlebenden und den tod von familienmitgliedern in keiner weise entsch digen k nnen so ist der betrag doch eine symbolische anerkennung des leidens im besetzten budapest
1660110 diese zahlungen stellen einen bedeutenden durchbruch f r die berlebenden aus budapest dar wir haben aufs engste mit der claims conference kooperiert um die gelder die eine wichtige anerkennung des leids der berlebenden bedeuten zu erhalten
1660111 die j dische gemeinschaft ungarns und die claims conference haben f r dieses bedeutende ergebnis eng zusammengearbeitet das resultat f hrt zu einer sp rbaren unterst tzung f r tausende von berlebenden

1660121 ich freue mich diesem ziel mit der auszeichnung des 400 fledermausfreundlichen hauses ein gutes st ck n her gekommen zu sein
1660122 seit 1978 unterst tzt die stiftung hessischer naturschutz als bindeglied zwischen amtlichen und ehrenamtlichen naturschutz projekte des natur und umweltschutzes gegr ndet wurde die stiftung vor dem hintergrund des in den 70er jahren gewachsenen bewusstseins ber die bedeutung der umwelt und die notwendigkeit zur erhaltung der nat rlichen lebensgrundlagen heute in einer zeit in der erstmals mehr menschen auf der welt in der stadt und den gro en ballungszentren leben erkennen wir hierbei die besondere bedeutung von projekten die eben dieser entwicklung entgegenwirkt seit dem gr ndungstag der stiftung haben wir es als besonders wichtig empfunden das verst ndnis der kinder und der heranwachsenden generation f r die elementare bedeutung eines geschlossenen kreislaufs der natur in all ihren facetten zu wecken
1660123 gegenstand der f rderung ist neben der aktion fledermausfreundliches haus das projekt bildungsinitiative waldwissen 2008 die schutzgemeinschaft deutscher wald hat eine fortbildung zu sieben ausgew hlten waldthemen f r lehrer sowie naturschutzinteressierte b rger in hessen ins leben gerufen die durch die finanzielle unterst tzung der stiftung hessischer naturschutz erm glicht wurde
1660124 daher freue ich mich nun ganz besonders dem haus am roten moor einen aktuellen bewilligungsbescheid berreichen zu d rfen damit auch alle heute hier versammelten g ste wissen worum es geht wurde der formelle bescheid schnell in die tat umgesetzt und das haus am roten moor verf gt nun ber eine weitere informationsm glichkeit in form eines flachbildschirms der die besucher des hauses mit aktuellen themen und bildern rund um den naturschutz dieser region versorgt
1660125 heute schaut die stiftung auf erfolgreiche 30 jahre der projektf rderung zur ck in meiner funktion als vorstandsvorsitzender bedanke mich bei allen beteiligten und w nsche f r unsere zuk nftige arbeit viele weitere f rderungsw rdige projekte und hoffe dass wir das f rdervolumen m glichst steigern k nnen

1660130 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1660131 die aussichten f r die industrieproduktion haben sich damit insgesamt weiter verschlechtert
1660132 wir waren davon ausgegangen dass es eine art gegenbewegung gibt zum schwachen monat mai mit steigendem auftragseingang deswegen ist es eine sehr gro e entt uschung und keine gute vorlage f r die deutsche industrie in den n chsten monaten
1660133 da sieht man was die wirtschaft dr ckt das ist vor allem die schlechte entwicklung bei den europ ischen nachbarn kurzfristig ist dort leider keine besserung in sicht im gegenteil
1660134 ich glaube in diesem jahr liegen wir ganz gut ob das jetzt 1 7 1 8 oder 1 6 prozent werden dass ist letztendlich ziemlich unerheblich
1660135 das ist keine phase das ist eine korrektur des booms den man geldpolitisch erzeugt hat
1660136 das ist einfach ein r ckschlag das ist nicht strukturelles

1660140 wir hoffen dass wir mindestens zwei drittel der stellen erhalten k nnen
1660141 allerdings m ssen die potenziellen aufsteiger ihre positionen noch bis ende august halten wovon man aber ausgehen kann

1660164 i am innocent and i am being targeted this according to me is politics played by shailaja along with the association i wont make such a mistake at all because i dont want to end my career like this
1660165 i have never touched any illegal substance and i have never failed a dope test in my life if all these claims are true i would even go to the extent of ending my life
1660166 she shailaja has played dirty politics with me how can the association recommend her name after she has been dope tested positive almost five times i have had 30 tests and all the tests have been negative these are all tactics adopted by the association to forbid me from participating at beijing
1660167 we did not have any sort of intimation on the withdrawal once a members name is given to the olympic association he or she cannot be substituted only she will go and nobody else can go
1660168 we dont have a copy of the report and the air tickets for the games has also not been provided she has been kept away from getting her ticket and all this is unfair on her part
1660169 altogether 57 players will be representing india in the beijing olympics out of which 12 or 13 will be participating in athletics but i dont have any expectation from them
1660170 i am particularly upset with anju bobby george in last olympics her best performance was 6 84 m but she has not repeated that performance in the past four years so i dont have any expectations from her
1660171 our relay team has done well in the recent past if they can get into the final it would be a great achievement but i believe shooting can bring one or two medals even archery and tennis especially leander paes and mahesh bhupathi have good chances of getting a medal
1660172 everybody knows that we are hosting the commonwealth games in 2010 but i am very disappointed with the training of the athletes for the event
1660173 four years ago i told suresh kalmadi and the then chief of army staff col jj singh to give the charge of the athletes training to the army but till date nothing has happened
1660174 die jetzt ver ffentlichten zahlen sind nach der einbeziehung von zwei neuen zielgruppen in die befragung zwar nicht vergleichbar mit fr heren ergebnissen dennoch ist offensichtlich der sr baut seine marktf hrerschaft im saarland weiter aus er erreicht mit seinem vielf ltigen radio angebot alle bev lkerungsgruppen im sendegebiet das publikum honoriert die mischung aus information und unterhaltung die wir t glich anbieten

1660210 this is something that ive been struggling with since the campaign began
1660211 theres a tendency i think when we because we talk hopefully about common grounds and sort of a bigger vision that we get tagged as oh hes all about words or hes its all hope or its all flash or sizzle and you know the truth is that throughout our campaign i think weve been offering a lot of very specific proposals
1660212 here is a man who grew up in a broken home whose father left at a young age and who was raised by a single mother
1660213 its an admirable story of rising from rags to riches one that resonates in many ways hes a modern horatio alger
1660214 now the mccain campaign wants to create a dramatically different narrative
1660215 they want you to see him as a man who went to fancy schools who has had the beneficiary of an elite life and is increasingly removed from the mainstream of normal american life
1660216 and now the mccain campaign wants to turn obamas strength into a weakness and make him seem like a celebrity who has nothing to offer but high blown words
1660217 hes obviously not in the same league as britney spears or paris hilton theyve gone way too far with that but weve seen where strategies that have been derided by commentators have been effective with voters
1660218 weve learned from previous campaigns that the effective way to create an alternative story for your rival is the summer before the fall campaign
1660219 you can but a ball and chain on an opponent and hes going to have a hard time running a race in the fall
1660220 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
1660221 you start to lay the message and it just builds
1660222 but hes not an elitist thats not a sustained campaign tactic here was someone who grew up with nothing verses the son of four star admirals its a nice try and a good diversion in the first part of august but painting him as an elitist is not a winning strategy going into the fall
1660223 because free media saw and heard about it it usually takes a multimillion dollar campaign to get onto national airwaves here you had an ad dissected and discussed because the mainstream media is willing to jump on any story because nothings going on at this point in the campaign in the course of the campaign normally youd see it on page a16 instead it was everywhere
1660224 its not such a negative thing to be a celebrity
1660225 hes trying to carry to much of the weight himself
1660226 if he doesnt pick hillary he needs national surrogates of that nature who will be listened to by the national press
1660227 its the idea that you have a stable of people
1660228 you have one or two wholl talk on national security another one or two who will take care of domestic issues and a couple of political insiders whore able to deal with situations when issues of race and ethnicity and class come up these are people who can stand before a group in southern ohio and theyll listen to him or her

1660258 camera applauds rep cantor for reminding cpb of something of primary importance to public broadcasting listeners and viewers not to mention the ultimate stakeholders in this issue taxpayers
1660259 that is that the laws creating the corporation for public broadcasting and providing for federal funding have long required cpb to exercise direct objectivity and balance oversight on behalf of congress and the public its past time that the corporation began upholding its obligation
1660260 public broadcasting law prohibits pre broadcast censorship and it also assumes post broadcast reviews so that chronic violators such as npr national public radio with its israel would be put on notice and if improvement was not made future funding requests would be more closely scrutinized rep cantors reminder to cpb that it must uphold the objectivity and balance requirement is most timely

1660328 at a time when the government have made extra resources available to help hard pressed families because of the rise in food and fuel prices it is even more important then normal to make sure people are claiming the benefits they are entitled to
1660329 lets be clear the government make these benefits available so people can claim them i welcome coventry cab playing their part in this initiative
1660330 many people simply assume they wont qualify for various benefits or are daunted by the prospect of making a claim we are urging anyone who is unsure about their entitlements to come along to the bureau and get a free confidential benefits check
1660331 do it now as you can claim backdated payments of up to 12 months before october 2008 we want to encourage as many people as possible to claim so coventry people can have the money they are entitled to

1660344 due to the current economic climate the difficulties following the smoking ban and price increases pubs are finding it very hard to survive i know for a fact that im struggling
1660345 this is a problem which is affecting the well established pubs as well as the newcomers to the industry
1660346 pubs used to be the beginning and end of life
1660347 today people can have their mates round have a few drinks and it costs them a fraction of the price
1660348 i warned this would happen a long time ago i said up to 20 per cent of our pubs in ipswich would close and if you look at the figures im not far wrong
1660349 i have never tried to scaremonger but the whole face of the industry is changing
1660350 we sell beer wines and spirits at prices that are competitive and from time to time we also run price promotions on a variety of lines
1660351 these are popular with our customers as they offer outstanding value
1660352 the vast majority of our customers who buy alcohol do so as part of their regular and large grocery shop and consume it over a period of time
1660353 the pub trade is so sat on by the police and the council were more regulated than anybody else
1660354 you see people at supermarkets buying trolley loads of beer because they can flog it so much cheaper but we are not allowed to sell alcohol like that
1660355 the cabbies will tell you that they are bringing people into town drunk nowadays drinkers are then coming into the pubs and having maybe one or two pints
1660356 to keep us a break even point i have to sell a bottle of becks for 3 but you could walk into a supermarket and buy 20 bottles for 8
1660357 this is killing our traditional pub trade we are losing part of our heritage everybody is bailing out of the industry
1660358 at the moment theres no restriction on what the supermarkets can do
1660359 pubs are closing down left right and centre and landlords are thinking why are we doing this
1660360 my husband got up because he could see an orange ball of light
1660361 he looked out of the window and saw our caravan on fire
1660362 the fire service turned up and then a chap came running down from up the road and said his car was on fire so another fire rescue was called out for them
1660363 just after the police and fire crew had gone another car exploded just down the road and two more caravans across our road
1660364 it was a nightmare we cannot believe this would happen in a quiet place like manningtree
1660365 i fit prosthetic limbs on men injured in small combine accidents there wasnt much call for that in los angeles so i moved here

1660684 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1660685 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1660686 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice

1660727 in the beginning of the grecian era the trojan horse while appearing to be a gift in reality carried soldiers that invaded the city the cellphone is todays trojan horse it appears to be a wonderful gift while inside lurks a dangerous enemy invisible harmful electromagnetic radiation
1660728 there is research that shows bluetooth devices may be as harmful as the cellphone itself you now have a microwave transmitter living in your ear right next to your brain while the power level may be lower from the bluetooth it is constantly transmitting its like sticking your head into the microwave oven but hoping its ok because you are setting the power level low
1660729 and i like to think of myself as specializing in health care as distinct from sick care and well being as distinct from treating the patient and the symptoms to simply making the pain go away my experience is while the medical world may be early adaptors of leading edge diagnostic systems they are often late adaptors of preventive concepts and systems such as the delta shield i have protected my family with this device and i strongly urge my patients and friends to use it

1660758 the growth of the internet as an advertising medium is taking business way from direct marketing classified and local and regional press but doesnt appear to be taking away from television what matters is that we outgrow the growth in internet advertising in the first half of this year the internet grew as an advertising medium by 24 percent and we grew at 43percent so were growing at nearly double the rate

1660785 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail he said

1660788 this will facilitate the capacity of young people from each country to work and holiday in each others countries he said
1660789 im a very firm believer that schemes like this broaden the understanding of each others cultures
1660790 usually when people are taking a holiday to australia they are only given a tourist visa and cannot work he told reporters
1660791 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1660792 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1660793 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1660794 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies

1660804 is it worth spending anything at all during the holidays
1660805 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1660806 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1660807 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1660808 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1660809 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1660810 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1660811 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us

1660815 just so you know the picture is the visual depiction of how hard i try to integrate into our swiss community
1660816 i got totally focused on trying to finish the game that i caught myself playing the game for hours at work
1660817 its like going shopping with a friend versus going alone
1660818 you get to bounce ideas off of each other and get new ideas its the kind of discovery that comes from shopping in a group that makes the site work
1660819 our social shopping site is a dynamic ever changing shopping magazine thats edited by hundreds of users
1660820 were a very active community and offer a large variety of social shopping tools
1660821 the people who recommend the most are driven by status and recognition
1660822 theres a real healthy competition that goes on to be the most influential people
1660823 once you get a shopping personality going youll develop a following
1660824 stylehive isnt where the final decision to buy something is made its the starting point and to be where decisions begin is important to retailers
1660825 the support on the site is fantastic it is hard to describe how much love and support and concern there is among the members
1660826 has been a great source of comfort to newly diagnosed diabetics
1660827 a lot of people still dont understand this disease or what is necessary to treat it
1660828 you can get health information anywhere it is a commodity
1660829 what we deliver through our social network platform are tools and a support group that can change the care people receive
1660830 a lot of people easily jump back and forth from myspace to facebook
1660831 we are finding that people are becoming more interested in vertical sites as well
1660832 people have gotten used to communing online and now they want to do it around specific topics
1660833 niche social networks is an idea that is growing in popularity as people want to connect to others with similar interests to themselves
1660834 in addition to connecting to others it also gives them a one stop shop on articles and content surrounding what interests them this isnt only for fitness but can be applied across the board for fashion beauty and so on
1660835 niche social networks have more meat than sites like facebook which are really about stalking your friends
1660836 i grew up with the promise that if one wanted to go to space they would get the chance
1660837 it became obvious that the only people that were going to space were government trained employees called astronauts other folks were not getting to go
1660838 the least likely guy was the one who won it this part time barnstorming airmail pilot
1660839 x was for the unknown for experimental for 10 10 million
1660840 the prize would be analogous to the prize that stimulated the aviation industry this prize though would stimulate the personal space industry
1660841 i read through it and i was kinda like hmm
1660842 i gave it a little bit of thought was like gosh you know if it were me id probably just try concrete vibrators
1660843 i was kinda like well gosh this is almost too obvious i struggled with that a little bit but i went ahead and submitted the solution and won
1660844 i was pretty dumbfounded at that point whod have thought
1660845 it could be your inventor next door or your ph d scientist from harvard
1660846 these people love the hunt they sometimes can connect dots that many people cant
1660847 they care about a lot more than just the money they want to be part of a community and they want to do stuff that matters
1660848 we find now organizations are really just beginning to see the power of inviting the outside world into really helping them with their innovation whether its inviting in customers or partners or 7 billion people
1660849 it doesnt replace inside innovation what it does is it provides a very powerful outside mechanism for driving innovation into the organization
1660850 we all hoped that within some years of the ansari x prize being won an industry would start for personal spaceflight i think none of us dreamt that that industry would actually start during the competition
1660851 when i stood there out at the tarmac on mojave and looked at the tail of spaceshipone and there was the logo for a business that had been launched to take paying customers into space it was incredible that this would happen concurrently with the prize and not in the distant future
1660852 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1660853 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1660854 we are obviously extremely concerned for their welfare and we would urge the chinese authorities to release them promptly
1660855 we urge china to be tolerant when it comes to issues of human rights tolerance and freedom of expression
1660856 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
1660857 the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems
1660858 probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status
1660859 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1660860 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1660861 important not to break the chain of the negotiations or we will face a difficult dynamic not only with iran
1660862 we cant deny to the other party the right to pose questions if there are problems
1660863 the message at the end of the telephone conference will probably be an agreement for an explanatory mission and at the same time a firm message with the threat of new sanctions
1660864 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common reponse there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia
1660865 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1660866 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1660867 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1660868 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1660869 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1660870 the olympic tournament doesnt feature in the official fifa calendar and there is no executive decision by fifa which establishes a right of release for under 23 players for this tournament
1660871 consequently schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona are not obliged to release the players rafinha diego and messi
1660872 cas appeals to the good sense of the clubs and fifa to find a reasonable solution which will allow a player who wishes to represent his country to compete in the olympic games
1660873 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1660874 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1660875 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1660876 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1660877 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1660878 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash
1660879 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1660880 at the moment the police are further investigating the matter
1660881 we are obviously extremely concerned for their welfare and we would urge the chinese authorities to release them promptly
1660882 we urge china to be tolerant when it comes to issues of human rights tolerance and freedom of expression
1660883 im sorry you didnt get to see what we wanted to see well get the information on what you came to see to you as soon as possible
1660884 it was lots of interviews filmed in tibet before march commenting on china the olympics and religious freedom voicing a lot of criticism
1660885 we were told that the two tibetans who made the film are now in detention
1660886 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1660887 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1660888 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1660889 i feel the olympics will help china develop because china used to be so closed and it gives an opportunity for the whole world to see china
1660890 i will be your congresswoman until i decide to retire
1660891 i am honored blessed and will continue to serve you to the very best of my abilities
1660892 theres a lot of people to compete against and when i get on the blocks im not going to be focusing on one person im going to be focusing on all seven guys and me
1660893 by the time i did the breaststroke in athens i was exhausted so for me to focus on one event i think its my best opportunity to win gold
1660894 it gives you a sense of the bigger picture the olympics look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer it hit home for me that there is a lot more to life than the olympics
1660895 all i told those guys is he kitajima has all the pressure on him which gives you the opportunity to sneak by people make mistakes in this meet and get out of their comfort zone if anyone can make a mistake its him because everyone is watching i made a mistake at trails and they had no problem passing me
1660896 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1660897 did we for example systematically take the side of one camp against another hutu against tutsi that is an untruth
1660898 did we fail to denounce the genocide committed by hutu extremists starting in april 1994 that is an untruth
1660899 did we remain passive when the rest of the international community was taking action that is an untruth
1660900 during my time as head of french diplomacy from april 1993 to may 1995 we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans
1660901 the relentless rise in the price of fuel more than eroded the strong revenue performance of the company

1660903 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that

1660946 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1660947 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1660948 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1660949 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1660950 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities

1661072 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1661073 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1661074 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1661075 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1661076 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1661077 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center

1661108 history will be kind to me for i intend to write it
1661109 they do it in the wild its like a child playing with a straw and glass of milk
1661110 i can sing in front of half a million people without a problem but i cant hit a golf ball straight in front of about 20
1661111 but playing golf makes me feel less like a machine even when there are 10 guys with cameras around
1661112 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too daily telegraph quoted hilton as saying breezily
1661113 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1661114 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president
1661115 so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1661116 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches she said
1661117 im thinking rihanna she said referring to the singer songwriter
1661118 ill see you at the white house oh and i might paint it pink bye she added
1661119 i really wanna have a sit down dinner with madonna im waiting for that invitation
1661120 i wanna ask her how shes made it through all of this and still continues
1661121 if she would just give me a little advice i really wanna pick her brain
1661122 man kann durchaus mal schauen ob man f r frauen und familien der ard sportschau nicht etwas entgegensetzen kann
1661123 wir m ssen jedoch klar sagen dass dieses ergebnisziel mit unsicherheiten behaftet ist
1661124 lpr hessen schreibt dvb t platz auf k64 rheinmain neu aus
1661125 where im from its considered rude to ask someone who they are voting for
1661126 we all know more about buffalo than we ever thought we would know
1661127 we have the possibility of preventing crashes from happening altogether
1661128 at least 50 children are injured weekly and at least two children die every week from injuries sustained when a vehicle backed over them
1661129 this is a divorce between two people who have been married for a long time and right now its at the ugly stage
1661130 this is a divorce between ted thompson and brett favre and as long as those people stay in place theres no way this thing is going to come to a satisfactory agreement in the long term you like both of them you want the best for both of them unfortunately theyre going to get dragged through the mud and the rest of us are getting dragged through right with them
1661131 he was not in the proper mindset to move forward to be a part of the football team
1661132 the team is moving forward the train has left the station he needs to jump on the train if we cant get past the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1661133 the packers paid him for his services and he delivered those services every single game since he got there in 1992 if youre a packers fan who makes you a better team brett favre or aaron rodgers there isnt any question that its brett favre thats why this whole thing is so ridiculous if theyre so convinced that aaron rodgers is the better player then why didnt he beat out brett favre before
1661134 it wasnt remotely close to what brett is going through but i got really mad when i was with the cardinals i claimed they didnt start me for a game or two because they wouldnt have to pay a 400 000 bonus to me i basically told them i didnt want to come back unless they pay me the money and if they didnt pay me the money it would be in their best interests to release me
1661135 i understand where hes coming from especially if ted thompson is hostile to brett favre there is a disconnect between those two guys i dont think he ever wants to play for ted thompson again
1661136 in the short term his legacy will take a hit
1661137 but seven years from now all this nonsense will be put behind everyone and theyll talk about how he was the cal ripken of the nfl and did something no other player was able to do and everybody will celebrate a great career
1661138 either because theyve never played before or theyre completely miserable and they sit in judgment about somebody and they dont know how difficult its been to do what he has done
1661139 ms hartner was more concerned about her well being her reaction was blank
1661140 our evidence will be placed on the record at that time

1661146 because i took some chances wrote with some new people and actually co wrote most of the songs on the album its very different
1661147 shes got something unique in her voice thats very subtle and a little smoky and sweet shes got a refreshingly spunky attitude to go along with it i detect a certain wisdom in her and yet a sense of wonder as well
1661148 edwards for president even if he is the white guy
1661149 i wanted a lollipop from the bank teller but they werf wouldnt give it to me
1661150 do you think when werf is in a relationship quickly heading towards engagement status that werf should disclose past morality issues with werfs significant other
1661151 every single game i do it at practice i almost do it too much sometimes im not paying attention when i should be but youll never ever have me at a football game and not just soaking it in
1661152 once we actually got to the real nitty gritty the game of football man i just picked it up and excelled
1661153 i hope that the same type of thing will happen here
1661154 maybe when i get there and see the crowd and my family itll be a different experience but coming from a school that played some real big games i dont think therell be much of a difference
1661155 you grow up watching games like this and its going to be so cool to be in it
1661156 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1661157 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1661158 my last two starts ive pitched terrible ive let us down
1661159 weve got to find a way to put another winning streak together
1661160 some bad counts some balls up in the zone the walks eight hurt us tonight thats the bottom line
1661161 i know a lot of people arent looking at me
1661162 the competitors who compete against me i dont think theyre overlooking me but i think a lot of the media is hyping the competition that allows me to maybe sneak in there and make things happen
1661163 i didnt sign because i didnt plan on getting injured and i still had work to do my thing was to make the team first the opportunity to make the olympic team comes around once in a lifetime and thats what i did
1661164 favres feeling was based on the path that took us to this point that he wasnt in the right mindset to play here
1661165 the football team is moving forward the train has left the station i have to keep the train moving
1661166 coach mike mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1661167 we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1661168 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed
1661169 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1661170 i am going to try and come back this year

1661174 el golf representa un icono en la construcci n automovil stica en todo el mundo por esta raz n el nuevo modelo es tambi n absolutamente nico e inconfundible en cuanto a su arquitectura y a su gr fica
1661175 el golf de la sexta generaci n es al mismo tiempo m s deportivo y conciso que cualquier otra generaci n de esta serie

1661177 cada detalle ha sido concebido para mejorar la calidad del golf sin ning n tipo de compromiso
1661178 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
1661179 a weakened skin barrier function might enable allergens to penetrate more easily and thereby promote the development of allergies
1661180 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
1661181 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways
1661182 communicating the right information to the right people at the right time in the right way
1661183 we need to tell the story of the important role that we the hse play in the delivery of public health and social services in every community in ireland
1661184 our ability to do this has a huge impact on our reputation and requires urgent and comprehensive action at a local and national level
1661185 we must always communicate in an honest timely and open manner and with courtesy and respect while respecting confidentiality
1661186 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
1661187 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support
1661188 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1661189 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks
1661190 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1661191 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1661192 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1661193 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1661194 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1661195 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1661196 in my accelerated classes the students have to read a book every two or three weeks and they were reluctant to add such a reading load on top of their regular classes but after the first cycle they realized it was cool and easy and they loved reading
1661197 the kids raved about it and the first friday night after it was assigned the students were texting each other saying they couldnt put it down
1661198 kind of a joke at first and then it got serious i used to not read very much but now i am reading all of the time and i have made loads of new friends through the club
1661199 and these are not the books i would have walked into a bookstore and bought
1661200 this year we plan to give all freshmen sophomores and juniors a reading test to track our members with the general population to see if they are improving
1661201 it is easy to see that the book groups also help them socially and they are making great strides in leadership i dont want them to just read but to give them new experiences through books
1661202 what happens with animals when their skin is ripped from their bodies when they are still alive its heartbreaking for me
1661203 i think they just didnt understand what we had planned
1661204 we are not protesting against china we just want to promote compassion for animals
1661205 to become more involved in the community and if youre not posting comments and if youre not doing that then hopefully you will because it will be a much more enjoyable experience
1661206 increased non linear loads on power systems create harmonics that affect all mains powered equipment and interfere with their operation
1661207 harmonics can cause equipment to overheat which damages insulation may cause fires and reduces the efficiency of electrical devices
1661208 they increase the distortion of the voltage which in turn can degrade or damage electrical equipment disturb the operation of sensitive applications cause electronic equipment to trip out and displays and lighting to flicker amongst other problems they also increase electricity consumption
1661209 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
1661210 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
1661211 say its the end of the semester and i have forty bucks i cant get off my card
1661212 a fourth battalion relieves some of the stress our soldiers and families face
1661213 part of the concern is our role is not going to diminish in iraq and afghanistan
1661214 ive been thinking about it the last three or four years and after this season i decided its time to move on
1661215 that was the most rewarding season ive ever had in coaching because we were down early in the year but were able to come back
1661216 but every year at catholic is rewarding its the best high school in the state of kentucky with great kids to work with
1661217 frankfort doesnt need a tall building like that that dwarfs all others
1661218 a better option would be to go with a smaller building
1661219 pretty much everything weve asked him to do on and off the field
1661220 when hartline was trying to get everybody together and somebody would get mad at him and say
1661221 just because someone is a player at this position or that position and perceived to be maybe more important than somebody else those rules still apply to them
1661222 and i think its critically important for us moving forward that unfortunately sometimes those ideals have to be reinforced to young people
1661223 zap often makes very big promises in press releases and news conferences but has yet to prove they can deliver all they say they can
1661224 theyve shown us a great concept but not a good business model
1661225 this order effectively lines up the administration with my house bill 243 which the house of representatives unanimously passed in february and which the republican leaders in the state senate effectively blocked
1661226 there was basically a little more as i delved deeper into it than i was aware of at the time
1661227 i kind of like to think that were in the business of taking young men and building them into responsible young men and obviously i feel like i failed in this situation
1661228 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed because somewhere along the line everybody has to realize theres consequences for their actions
1661229 mike has done pretty much everything weve asked him on and off the field
1661230 it would be foolish for me based on what i saw in the spring and on what we have at quarterback to say that mike hartline isnt the preemptive starter
1661231 we dont completely fall off the face of the earth
1661232 we have three guys that were going to be part of it that right now arent going to be but i feel like we have enough quality athletes and talent that its a completely realistic goal
1661233 they laid out some specific things that curtis needed to do but everybody felt like he could eventually move forward and still have a chance to be the starting quarterback
1661234 curtis realizes that hes let his teammates fans and coaches down
1661235 now all those people arent going to be there for him
1661236 he told me that out of all those guys he used to hang with not one of them have checked in with him to see how hes doing thats just one of those life lessons he will just have to get past this move on and try to become a better man and person because of it
1661237 but expectations were so high for him and he probably got caught up in some of the hype
1661238 when i recruited curtis i had all these expectations of him being a great player
1661239 and he is a great player we just never saw it at kentucky
1661240 natural gas prices this summer have hit levels not seen since the fall of 2005 when supplies were disrupted by hurricanes katrina and rita
1661241 although prices have fallen in recent weeks it still seems likely that heating costs this winter will be higher than in the last two years
1661242 to tell you the truth it was i just couldnt believe it if i havent been playing very well this scenario wouldnt have never happened
1661243 so to me it was a compliment and i enjoyed it
1661244 ive been able to win 12 times out here but ive never been able to get it done in a major i never even really played well until 96 when i lost in the playoff to mark brooks at the pga at valhalla back home in kentucky so i havent had much success other than that week in all the majors
1661245 puttings always held me back for the past three months i putted better than i ever putted in my life period if i putt somewhere near like i putted this summer ive got a great shot this week
1661246 set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september this will be a great place to do it
1661247 it just taught me i need to set more goals in my life my only goal was to make the ryder cup team thats all i focused in on this year
1661248 i believe as an individual you need to decide what allows you to play your best golf
1661249 and you need to go that direction regardless of the scrutiny
1661250 i tried to let it out and it didnt cooperate so i had to back off a little bit i had been feeling great all week
1661251 unlike people in other countries israelis were quick to adopt cell phone technology and have continued to be exceptionally heavy users
1661252 this unique population has given us an indication that cell phone use is associated with cancer
1661253 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1661254 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers

1661260 we are losing ground at the sheriffs office because of the pay we will fall further and further behind and never catch up
1661261 the workload speaks volumes the data suggests an 80 20 split in calls coming from unincorporated vs incorporated areas
1661262 in my opinion it is not up to us to decide whether or not raises get funded it is your decision the county commission decides whether or not our people get pay raises if something else has to fall off the table we prioritize that you have that flexibility in your budget
1661263 its really going to transform the way we do science
1661264 but its natural value is really difficult for us to estimate
1661265 in my career in higher education i cant think of a more significant gift in terms of its potential impact on our society and on the university
1661266 when people came here in 1492 this is what they saw
1661267 this is one of the few places that you have some of this left
1661268 this is the best that weve seen in a long while
1661269 the further we get into the season the plumper the scallops get and thats why i wait to go scalloping until the second half of the season
1661270 as the season goes along they get a little plump and a little sweeter
1661271 this new equipment is not something we want to give away a lot of details about because it is not something you would ever suspect and we dont want to give that information away
1661272 this will improve our aviation capabilities during state emergencies weapons of mass destruction events counterdrug missions or any missions in the united states to provide security and surveillance
1661273 instead of using 1960s technology like we have with the kiowas the new lakotas use 21st century technology
1661274 a multi mission helicopter that is currently used worldwide for law enforcement emergency medical transportation search and rescue and corporate transport
1661275 a nonpartisan political organization encourages the informed and active participation of citizens in government works to increase understanding of major public policy issues and influences public policy through education and advocacy
1661276 even though the people that come before you in county court are mostly small claims action to them its the most important thing in their life
1661277 the solutions are night courts at legal aid i started night clinics it was better for people people wouldnt have to take off of work especially for people who were dealing with debt issues they wouldnt have to take time off of work
1661278 well for one working a full 40 hours is helpful and two courtroom management skills keeping the docket moving ive had trials in 37 counties in florida and ive seen good courtroom management and ive seen bad courtroom management judges are in charge of their courtroom
1661279 the only thing that can be done is everybody is going to have to work a little harder back in the early 90s we went through the same budget cuts in the prosecutors office i remember doing a rolling grand jury case without being paid im kind of accustomed to that with working through budget difficulties
1661280 in its very nature both criminal court dockets and civil court dockets are busy and crowded as a hearing officer ive already faced a huge docket does it mean i have to come in a little early fine does it mean i have to leave a little late fine the main thing its important that a judge be able to listen to and respect people
1661281 i think honestly what integrity is is doing whats right when no one else is listening youre going to say whats right say whats honest even if its going to cost you a case you can only present the facts as they are you have to trust the judge to see the reality
1661282 that shows integrity that youre not just going to smear someone for the sake of smearing someone
1661283 being a prosecuting attorney for 10 years you have to make very important decisions about who to charge and whether or not to charge crimes when you have a case load of hundreds of cases there were frequently challenges
1661284 were not going to be policing whats going on off campus
1661285 if you have a keg and have your friends over i dont think theyre going to bust you and send you to judicial
1661286 unfortunately bad things happen when theres a lot of drinking going on
1661287 an affirmative verbal response or acts that are unmistakable in their meaning
1661288 if the conduct could undermine the safety or security of the university community or the integrity of the educational process
1661289 and dont forget the flour last time you forgot the flour sometimes i think youd forget your head if it wasnt attached
1661290 i didnt hear you james edward what did you say
1661291 so you gonna squeeze in a few minutes at the rack jimmy boy
1661292 it seems like everyone knows what they want in their life it seems like everyone has all of these people in their lives to laugh with and to talk to and to tell secrets to and to bond with and im all by myself everyones got it so figured out
1661293 i wonder if anyone else in the whole world feels the things i feel or if theres another person out there that knows these exact feelings and are experiencing them at this very second
1661294 do you have any plans for the night its the weekend you know why dont you call someone up and find something fun to do
1661295 when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend
1661296 its not like i need to be going out doing all of these maniacal things that these kids do anyhow i dont know what is more maniacal the fact that these kids ingest and chug down these ridiculous illegal substances and do all of these ridiculous things when they are under the influence of these maniacal substances or the fact that they think there is nothing maniacal about doing these things
1661297 when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend
1661298 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1661299 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1661300 i am concerned about north koreas human rights record i am concerned about the uranium enrichment
1661301 we will find that we will not be able to find and kill the last terrorist because well he is a metaphor and you cant kill a metaphor you can only turn it into a clich
1661302 soldiers guarded him in the labor camp and now they are around him here
1661303 this is a man i had always wanted to see
1661304 it is just too bad it was only after his death
1661305 why do particular stories work in particular contexts why one story rather than another
1661306 she revealed her own dread of not creating children or books her dread of what she might create her dread of creativity itself and her desire to create
1661307 we are constantly measuring ourselves against the story and the story against ourselves
1661308 engage listeners on a variety of levels within a unified narrative frame
1661309 you have to consider what kind of storytelling experience do you want to achieve and for whom and in what combinations
1661310 the possibilities are greater but the stakes and the challenges are higher
1661311 story is a shared venture and that is the source of its power and its mystery
1661312 the liberating anarchic voices of storytellers must live on whatever the medium because they are the voices of humanity

1661321 follow me i need to finish up her paperwork anyway

1661334 theyve been trying to get my attention ever since they came in
1661335 one of my friends over there wants your phone number so she can send you a text
1661336 i thought you were trying to work something out with your girlfriend
1661337 superannuation entitlements should not be tied in any way to private couple relationships this terminology is merely a euphemism for immoral same sex relationships and constitutes yet another attack on the sanctity of marriage
1661338 both male homosexual and lesbian relationships are significantly more unstable than marriage with lesbian relationships breaking up within the first eight years at over three times the rate of marriages
1661339 at the same time i think theres much less concern among social conservatives about same sex marriage than there was four years ago so its harder to galvanise on that issue as well
1661340 the issue is more mainstream now more widely discussed its not as threatening to many people

1661343 laws in different states and territories are complex and inconsistent often forcing prospective parents to cross state lines to have children via surrogacy
1661344 i will now be asking the nsw legislative council standing committee on law and justice to conduct a full review and report on the issues and this process will allow stakeholders to contribute their thoughts
1661345 this is an extremely sensitive area requiring some difficult moral and ethical issues to be resolved
1661346 another important issue that needs to be considered is whether surrogate mothers should receive reimbursement for reason able expenses from the commissioning parents such as hospital fees and medical costs even though commercial surrogacy will not be allowed
1661347 considering this was a peaceful protest it is essential that these people are immediately provided with consular access and legal advice
1661348 then they must be either charged or released as soon as possible
1661349 the foreign office must put pressure on the chinese authorities to ensure that these protesters are treated fairly and with dignity
1661350 the chinese government should not be using heavy handed and repressive tactics to deal with peaceful protests

1661363 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
1661364 almost 30 years after the outbreak the aids epidemic has stabilized at a high level at the beginning of the year around 33 million people were infected with the virus according to un figures research has managed to turn the terminal illness into a chronic one so that if someone adapts their lifestyle they can grow old with the disease
1661365 for africa however aids is still an unbelievably dismal problem while for example in thailand the epidemic was stifled at birth when brothel owners were threatened with closure if prostitutes working there did not use condoms in africa little has changed it shows that the problem cannot be solved with money alone already more money is spent today on fighting aids than on illnesses like malaria and dysentery which cause a lot more deaths aids however has roots deep in the cultural practices which makes fighting against it particularly difficult the most important starting point would be to increase young womens control over their own sexuality which is prevented by the patriarchal social structures
1661366 the biggest problem in many parts of sub saharan africa is that it is not unusual to have a string of sexual partners at the same time this leads to interwoven networks that makes it much easier to transmit hiv
1661367 it is particularly fatal that in many parts of africa it is normal for older men to have much younger girlfriends that spreads the virus very quickly between the generations and hits young dependent women particularly hard black women between the ages of 16 and 24 have seen by far the highest growth rates of infection
1661368 the fact that the political and religious leadership in africa has completely failed only aggravates the situation a prime example is south african president thabo mbeki who has spread lies about the aids epidemic and its treatment for years thus being indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of south africans
1661369 the biggest danger is that medical developments will reduce public awareness of the danger aids is still an incurable disease in the face of the growing carelessness this is a message that cannot be emphasized enough
1661370 now is not the time to give up hope is the slogan at the 17th international aids conference one in every two dollars that is spent on development aid is used in the fight against aids and these billions seem to be finally having an effect for the first time less people are becoming infected with hiv and less are dying from aids nevertheless there is little good news to report there is no cure for the disease in sight the vaccine researchers cannot report any breakthrough and neither can those scientists working on micro biocides to protect women from hiv at the same time prevention is failing in those very countries where it was such a success for years the rate of all sexually transmitted diseases is increasing in industrial nations a clear signal that condoms are being used less often
1661371 no other leader has been spoken about in mexico city as much as george w bush it is the american president of all people who has made himself the leading aids do gooder even overshadowing bill clinton and bill gates bush is serious the united states is to spend 40 billion over the next five years on fighting aids the president has just lifted the 20 year old ban on allowing hiv positive people to enter the country russia has already indicated that it is now also reconsidering its entry policy
1661372 hiv has lost much of its threat for many germans while 15 years ago two thirds of those polled said they thought aids was a dangerous disease last year that had gone down to just one third that is rational germans know how they can protect themselves from the virus a large proportion of sexually active people do so last year 209 million condoms were sold in germany more than ever before the disease is still not curable of course but it is possible for those infected with hiv to live until they are 60 or 70 years old with the right treatment one could think that for germany aids would soon only be an issue within the context of development aid however that argument overlooks a serious problem people may not die quickly from hiv but for many the diagnosis means social death
1661373 in mexico thousands of people demonstrated for more rights for those with aids they were not just fighting for more access to therapies but also against discrimination in latin america ostracism of those infected is particularly prevalent but in germany too a life with hiv is also a life with discrimination in particular on the labor market where it is more difficult for those with hiv to find a job
1661374 a life without work means for those with hiv very often a life lived in poverty leading to even more social exclusion
1661375 those with aids should be treated the same as those with other chronic diseases they deserve help and sympathy when looking for work it is high time that the irrational fear of those with the disease is diminished just as much as the fear of the disease itself

1661392 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
1661393 our results show that carbon dioxide induced acidification of seawater at levels predicted for the year 2100 reduced fertilisation success of an ecologically dominant marine species by 25 per cent
1661394 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
1661395 agriculture has only existed in wa for 150 years in europe and asia this happened thousands of years ago but here theres still a new interface between native crops and introduced species
1661396 hardenbergia has been in australia for very long time well before agriculture but weve discovered in the greenhouse that it will infect lupin
1661397 due to climate change there is also the possibility of a change in vectors which means we may get new viruses appearing in crop plants and native species
1661398 with more than 12 000 endemic plant species in wa hardenbergia mosaic virus undoubtedly represents the tip of the iceberg
1661399 because of the regions isolation over millions of years its probable that there are many undescribed families of viruses yet to be discovered

1661460 s claro que vamos a tocar temas diferentes pero no s lo de black sabbath sino tambi n de lo nuevo de heaven and hell
1661461 s empezamos tocando conciertos m s largos pero tuvimos que recortarlo en un par de shows que ten amos menos tiempo
1661462 escuch en un primer momento que se iban a reunir los 4 y me pareci un poco injusto porque yo hab a tocado mucho m s tiempo con ronnie que bill pero bueno no pod a hacer nada y me parec a bien la reuni n pese a todo poco tiempo despu s parece que esa formaci n no termin de cuajar y recib una llamada invit ndome a participar con ellos y por supuesto dije que s y funcion muy bien de todos modos adoro a bill es uno de mis dolos un tipo estupendo e incluso l sugiri que pod amos hacer la gira los dos l tocando sus temas y yo los m os porque a l no le gusta tocar canciones que no sean suyas yo siempre he tocado temas de otra gente con lo que no ten a ning n problema con eso pero bill siempre ha sido bill risas y l propuso que hubiera dos bater as pero hubiera habido problemas y l os varios y al final no se hizo
1661463 despu s de que yo dejara el grupo para tocar con ozzy risas no estuvo bien y finalmente hemos tenido la oportunidad de conducir el mismo coche juntos habl ndolo todo y ahora s lo hay agua sobre el puente hay que mirar adelante las cosas pasan y ya est pero ahora mismo hay realmente muy buen rollo entre todos los miembros del grupo una relaci n y un ambiente muy agradable

1661473 whats lacking at present is weight and depth he delivers the great soliloquies with clarity but he doesnt always discover their freight of emotion
1661474 this is a gripping hamlet that could become great if tennant finds the courage to raise the dramatic stakes still further
1661475 is that for all the stage door excitement and box office success this is not the greatest dane
1661476 maybe its because hes such a tv pin up or maybe his interpretation of hamlet light on power politics heavier on personal hiatus is likely to appeal more to the female mind
1661477 i think the bbfc do very good and important work but i was surprised having seen and enjoyed the dark knight that it was a 12a and not a 15
1661478 the film contains violent and disturbing scenes even though its a brilliant movie we should remember that bbfc classifications are only advisory and local authorities are ultimately responsible for classifications it would be interesting to see if any local authorities wish to use their powers for this and future films

1661495 these standards must reflect the general quality of life improvements in
1661496 the mark of a humane society is how it protects its weaker members and i want to introduce a set of standards that will eliminate sub standard accommodation from the rental market
1661497 and even more offensive than the tiny grotty places i went to see was the fact that a stereotypical landlord would actually have the audacity to show the place i mean there were frequent times where i wanted to deck the guy for having the cheek
1661498 and there were so many of them around then squeezing as much money as they could from desperate people and not willing to put any cash into refurbishing the properties
1661499 it would have been impossible to swing a rat never mind a cat in some of these places many of them would have a horrible musty smell and others would have mould growing on the walls the people trying to let them didnt care enough to remove the mould because they knew that some poor eejit would be desperate enough to rent there anyway
1661500 and the red circles around places that sounded okay in print the most dispiriting thing of all was knowing for certain that when you turned up to look at said flat there would be at least 10 other people in the queue ahead of you
1661501 and heres the weird thing in almost every place i went to see there was a goth of some description there too
1661502 i was okay in that i was going to college and i felt that i wouldnt have to do the bedsit thing when i got older but youd see guys in their 40s and youd think that that could be you some day still having to put up with such awful accommodation it still sends a shiver down my spine
1661503 it was 1984 and i was living in a tiny bedsit above a chinese takeaway in bbc berkshire at the time and the pay was so awful i couldnt afford anywhere else and i ended up staying there for a year and a half
1661504 there was a constant aroma of chinese cooking i think the entire flat reeked of monosodium glutamate the smell never left it would get so bad that myself and the guy i shared with would end up having to go for a walk to stop ourselves from being sick
1661505 it seemed to have seeped into the carpets the curtains and the furniture this mix of cigarette smoke and dirt and was impossible to get out of the place no matter how long the windows were left open for
1661506 the sitting room also doubled as a bedroom so whenever my flatmate brought a girl around i would have to vacate and that would be particularly grim in the depths of winter
1661507 there was a sign right outside the window and it blinked on and off constantly when the light was off in our room and we were watching the telly the room would glow red every other second
1661508 the takeaway used to open until around 1am so getting to sleep outside with all the noise was very difficult the trick was to sleep during the day before it opened and sometimes the work shifts would allow you to do that
1661509 for some reason i remember the two of us sitting down to watch the very first episode of eastenders on the box and eating chinese from downstairs i think they used to take pity on us and now and again they would hand out food to us
1661510 when my parents finally managed to get rid of me they moved without telling me to be honest i ended up living in a flat in pembroke street
1661511 the rent was affordable the location was brilliant the bloke i was sharing with was sound there was just one problem four of the flats had to share the one bathroom
1661512 as someone who barely manages to grunt at neighbours and who tries to maintain an air of benign indifference with those around me a localised version of dont ask dont tell the whole notion of sharing a toilet seat with complete strangers is completely anathema and frankly repugnant
1661513 there was something utterly soul destroying about having to queue up every morning outside the bathroom door with toothbrush in hand waiting for the old sailor who lived in the flat across the hall to finish his morning ablutions
1661514 and as fond as he was of regaling anyone who would listen to his tales from the days of the merchant marine he neglected to inform us that he had obviously picked up some weird and debilitating bowel condition on his travels which rendered not just the bathroom but the whole place virtually uninhabitable for hours after he went
1661515 eventually the daily humiliation of having to queue outside my own bathroom like some toilet ridden supplicant became too much and i moved out
1661516 i lessened the glare from the stained synthetic carpet by putting up a red light
1661517 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1661518 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1661519 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1661520 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1661521 i looked up the time that the winner of the individual pursuit had done in the previous olympics
1661522 i figured that its going to be a bit quicker this time around and tried to work out the wattage needed to win gold and decided to go for it
1661523 but i knew i could make them then i had to start somewhere and learn as i went along
1661524 the first automatic olympic qualification places are the world champion the world cup winner and the top five in the rankings
1661525 then the top eight team pursuit nations and the b world champion get a spot as well each country can have a maximum of two riders
1661526 also the world champion and the world cup winner are going to be in the top five and that brings it back two places because im sixth im next to qualify it would have been better if they could have told us there and then but weve met the criteria and were going anyway
1661527 youre only talking a handful of seconds looking at video analyses of the world cups and the world championships i didnt ride the black line all that well which is basically the shortest point from a to b
1661528 its pretty hard to stay on a line half an inch thick when youre doing 40 miles an hour but the top guys stay down on the line that could save me a second
1661529 it is my opinion that brandon oneill will be on the team theres no question about it
1661530 his leg is not so good now but improving very very fast compared to yesterday his legs much better he started to do some skills today on floor and vault i think everythings going very very well i hope 99 per cent that brandon will be ready he is very strong a tough boy he can do everything im sure
1661531 i dont think the ankles going to be 100 per cent
1661532 thats probably pretty obvious a lots going to come into just how big a heart brandon has and how much pain he can handle with the assistance of the medical team
1661533 for what he did today it wasnt that bad he spend the last two days lying in a bed with his leg up
1661534 it was a pretty big improvement from what we were doing
1661535 obviously we didnt play as well as we would have liked to but its the first game of the olympics we were a little nervous a little anxious but we always say the first game in a tournament is the hardest to get a result in
1661536 i think it was a factor just in the sense that youll start to feel a bit more tired earlier on in the game than you would in another environment
1661537 but like ive said so many times before its something that both teams have to deal with so i dont think its necessarily going to change the game too much or the outcome of the game
1661538 after the ball went in the net i turned around and it just hit me that this is the first goal weve ever had in the olympics it was a special moment for me and my teammates
1661539 i think we slowly wore them down they started to get really tired at the end of the second half and thats when that type of thing comes into play
1661540 we didnt lose too many punts in the air that type of thing
1661541 we could probably have put away a few more goals on corners and free kicks but we got one off of it
1661542 the fact that he fired it was pretty unbelievable that no one was hurt
1661543 if you dont come with me bad things are going to happen
1661544 yes i took her and as long as you play by my rules she will come back unharmed and breathing however failure to abide by the rules will result in a bullet put in her head my rules do suffer
1661545 its unconscionable its inexcusable i dont know what you want to call it to attack a 78 year old
1661546 wow thats awesome you guys are going to the canyon thats like awesome

1661549 i am the way and the truth and the life
1661550 this is my son whom i love listen to him
1661551 in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going there to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am
1661552 this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because there deeds were evil
1661553 i am with you to the very end of the age
1661554 fantastic but naughty like spending the last day of lent in a bath full of pi a colada
1661555 as long as i dont ask them to do one short sharp noise together like a clap or cymbal crash which could be a disaster
1661556 i wanted a huge percussion section you know eight bass drums and 16 marimbas but ill at least have a snare drum and some toy percussion whistles and klaxons
1661557 but i like to see people enjoying themselves its a one off with its own identity
1661558 im waiting for dad to email me some ideas hes good at that and has come up with lots of my titles
1661559 its all held me up a bit especially spending 10 days in hospital but everyone at the bbc has been totally understanding and not pressurised me at all though it must be pretty nerve racking for them
1661560 not exactly i feel quite comfortable writing for orchestras and im just going in there all balls flying
1661561 i dont rewrite much if i get too picky and finicky about what im doing i write crap music
1661562 i draw big graphic shapes to conjure the kind of piece im aiming at with a timeline of what happens where and arrows and signs for the loud bits then i pace around making cuts and stabs on the score and stomp and whack the piano and yell its all quite tribal
1661563 i love using live electronics often grimy and industrial and glitchy sounding ill stumble across a rhythm and obsess and burrow into it
1661564 i had a good ear and played in youth orchestras but i wasnt brilliant and i knew i couldnt make a career out of it
1661565 the teacher at my local comp seemed to think i was quite good but it was all still quite tentative
1661566 the camberwell style is eclectic from jazz and electronic to well haphazard we all have different tastes but its all very ballsy and faff free
1661567 its never been an issue or a problem my music isnt very girly or delicate its nasty and raucous and gutsy
1661568 as long as the music is honest thats all i care about if that doesnt sound like a self righteous preacher
1661569 all the time i listen when i dance or cook i hoover to stravinsky its noisy enough and you can hear the rhythms and the energy above the racket
1661570 pericoli e le opportunit poste dai grandi motori di ricerca ed in particolare da google
1661571 it works in about three different systems most of the time a bit of music would tell what lyrics would come its the mood or the tone of the track that influences the song format
1661572 other times the track will play and i doodle on it and whatever spills out is what lyrics we use on the track
1661573 alternatively i would go thats really amazing and i got to go now and work lyrically to make this song fit
1661574 we have so much to do with bang gang and the presets we always reference stuff and they would have heard all our demos
1661575 and they say yes we like that one or not like that one
1661576 i think 2 maybe has an 80 20 difference from the last album its fresh where do i begin certainly has a different sneaky take with its acoustic guitar and just me singing i thought kansas city was quite different as well
1661577 i want a bit of mix and match its still very happy and dance but dirty and clean at the same time
1661578 the positive thing about recording an album is to be completely honest and have trust so if you do something musically you value the opinion of your bandmates but you have enough diminished pride to take their criticising
1661579 it was amazing because they dont give a shit theres no beating around the bush and they have the gumption to say they like it
1661580 theres a big sense of fun and thats what we want to do with the music

1661582 since there is research which directly links an increased risk of hiv transmission to syphilis early detection and treatment is another weapon in our fight against hiv infection
1661583 there was a review of australias hiv testing guidelines a couple of years ago and at that point the issue of rapid testing was discussed but wasnt supported outside of clinical settings in specific circumstances and home testing wasnt supported at all
1661584 the reason i dont think its been fast tracked or pushed for is that of all the developed western nations testing rates in australia are the highest among men who have sex with men and gay men in the 80 percent plus
1661585 i support same sex marriage i have for many many years i believe that a civilised society is a society that is inclusive and is a society that affords the same human rights the same access to justice the same equality under the law for every single one of its citizens
1661586 it was the fourth anniversary of the marriage ban but i dont think its self defeating to focus only on marriage the community needs to focus on a range of things
1661587 our priority is getting 58 in 08 but we havent lost sight of the fact our community needs formal relationship recognition as well
1661588 we need to ensure the government and the coalition follow through with their commitment to implement the recommendations of the hreoc report until thats done we wont have de facto equality
1661589 tuesdays arrest is a significant outcome in this investigation however it will never be closed until matthews body is recovered
1661590 his family and friends will continue to grieve and suffer until his remains are located and my detectives will continue to work on this inquiry to bring some closure to their pain
1661591 this is going to be a milestone moment i think in which people not only in the retail business but in the systems security business will be taking a hard look at what can be done to further strengthen network security
1661592 theres no clever science behind it its just an effort to make you smile in exactly the same way cadbury dairy milk does

1661600 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimize its illegal occupation of tibet
1661601 at this moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades
1661602 we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1661603 it is vitally important at this moment when beijing and the chinese leadership are preparing to host the world at the opening ceremonies in just two days time that the tibetan issue is not swept under the carpet by the beijing regime and that what is actually a human rights crisis and an ongoing crackdown inside tibet is brought into the open
1661604 there are a number of other people of conscience in beijing who are committed to speaking out during these olympics peacefully

1661610 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1661611 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1661612 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1661613 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
1661614 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
1661615 we always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion and as acknowledged by the border patrol this was the case in the episode at ajo
1661616 withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it

1661640 the at amp t global network combined with our powerful computing platform is driving the convergence of networking and hosting services in ways that are allowing companies to deliver end user applications whenever and wherever they are needed while paying only for the capacity actually used
1661641 in todays business environment this kind of flexibility and cost benefit is urgently needed by companies that need their web sites and end user applications to perform flawlessly
1661642 fans of the 2008 olympic games expect to go online searching for a variety of content about the olympic games and athletes
1661643 we anticipate rapidly increasing traffic up to and during the beijing olympic games tapering off in the months following the events at amp t synaptic hosting is ideal for handling the fluctuating online demand associated with the olympic games
1661644 companies are looking to service providers to help them build and manage scalable next generation infrastructure environments for their business critical applications
1661645 given the increasingly dynamic nature of end user requirements businesses need flexible delivery platforms for their applications
1661646 this trend is driving the need for network cloud based on demand capabilities such as utility computing the challenge for service providers is to productize these capabilities in a way that enable businesses to easily tailor the solutions to serve their specific needs synaptic hosting is one example of how managed services can be offered in a modular fashion enabling efficient scalability and on demand delivery

1661685 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues

1661687 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash

1661692 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1661693 we have a limited attendance at our four mines in south africa
1661694 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1661695 these strikes will probably do more damage than good because all we do is send a message that were a strike prone country and its not good for the image of south africa
1661696 on the other hand if we ignore the plight of the poor people were going to do it at our peril because this is a cry from the working and poor classes to do something dramatic
1661697 the decline in oil prices largely reflects ongoing worries that oil demand has weakened especially in the us
1661698 as well it appears that tropical storm edouard has had only a limited impact on oil production in the gulf of mexico
1661699 we are pleased with the consistent progress that omv continues to make posting stronger six month results in all segments compared to the same period last year
1661700 in particular the upstream environment continues to be favourable with petrom once again contributing significantly to group results
1661701 however new upstream production together with ongoing efficiency initiatives at petrom should help offset these developments
1661702 there are two things that you would need to get a signal to other planets firstly it has to be able to leave our planet secondly it would have to have as much power as possible
1661703 as you go into space that power would dissipate they would need more and more sensitive equipment to pick it up
1661704 detecting a signal like this with lots of background noise would be incredibly hard but what they would look for is a pattern in the signals to show that they were not naturally occurring
1661705 some of our radars are easily detectable quite far hundreds of light years into space if the aliens wish to try and if theyre in the beam
1661706 of course no one more than about 50 70 light years away will have yet heard from us but i figure that our earliest broadcasts are washing over about one new star system each day so the potential audience is growing

1661712 we are unable to explain the uap sightings satisfactorily without either a discounting at least some significant features of the reports or b doing violence to at least some conventional meteorological optics or conventional eql phenomenology we hope that readers of this report will find it helpful in deciding which if either of those courses of action seems the more reasonable and economical
1661713 this situation is a threat to the operations of kindergartens which is sensitive and important in the lives of young children a lack of employees also increases pressure on the remaining kindergarten directors and staff members and makes parents concerned and anxious
1661714 parties will make offers at a certain price and others can then accept these offers
1661715 in that way we will both have price determination on the market and a platform to trade with electricity
1661716 today there is no such platform people just pick up the phone and call each other
1661717 everyone involved in this market agrees that a formal price determination and platform is necessary for example its natural that shortage and redundancy influence the price to some extent the forces supply and demand will be influential factors
1661718 we are taking the first step but of course we hope that we can take further steps in the future our role is to establish the market and encourage simulative operations so that people see the benefits in trading on the market and activity is created

1661728 abschied vom immer mehr und legen stattdessen mehr wert auf das immer besser letzteres ist nachhaltiger und sorgt f r mehr lebenszufriedenheit langfristig ver ndert sich damit auch das statusdenken prestige gewinnt der der mit sich und seinem leben zufrieden ist und nicht der der sich immer mehr leisten kann die soziale dimension des lebens wird wichtiger als die materielle

1661776 i dont think we would have lost that game last season we were a harder team to beat
1661777 maybe its as a group thinking because youve played in a uefa cup final you dont need to do the nasty bits of the game anymore

1661779 you need to earn the right to win games and that starts with hard work
1661780 we didnt work anywhere near as hard as we did last year and weve not been pulling our weight in pre season either
1661781 we need to get back to basics and start pulling in the one direction again
1661782 we had a tremendous run last season and it wasnt because we were individually brilliant and had lots of flair
1661783 it was all down to hard work and a wee bit of luck along the way

1661794 saddam sealed his fate when he decided to switch to the euro in late 2000 and later converted his 10 billion reserve fund at the u
1661795 the effect of an opec switch to the euro would be that oil consuming nations would have to flush dollars out of their central bank reserve funds and replace these with euros the dollar would crash anywhere from 20 40 in value and the consequences would be those one could expect from any currency collapse and massive inflation think argentina currency crisis for example youd have foreign funds stream out of the u s stock markets and dollar denominated assets thered surely be a run on the banks much like the 1930s the current account deficit would become unserviceable the budget deficit would go into default and so on your basic 3rd world economic crisis scenario the united states economy is intimately tied to the dollars role as reserve currency

1661837 veel mensen aan de rechterzijde van het politieke spectrum vinden dat er in de media overdreven veel aandacht aan barack obama wordt besteed aandacht die bovendien niet kritisch genoeg is
1661838 het anti obama lezerspubliek bestaat uit mensen die zich niet meer van hun overtuigingen laten afbrengen maar daar juist bevestiging voor zoeken het obama lezerspubliek bestaat ook uit dat soort mensen maar tegelijk ook uit mensen die nieuwsgierig naar hem zijn en ook om die reden zijn boeken kopen

1661873 when we found out that barack obama had written that white folks greed runs a world in need in one of his books we were none too happy all of a sudden we heard barack obama in his own voice in the audio version of his book engaging a form of blood guilt with white people as the guilty party not a way to endear yourself to potential voters
1661874 few people among any group white black or otherwise believe that gangsta culture is a particularly good thing for anyone and yet purveyors of this culture are increasingly showing their support for obama in some cases with verbiage that includes veiled threats of violence if he doesnt win perhaps obama cannot be entirely blamed for this support but perceptions are perceptions and since kanye west is performing at the dnc this year one can hardly fault people for having those perceptions

1661953 obama handled this wingtard with a lot of class and in the process made it obvious what the
1661954 cant answer the reason why one of us hasnt won it in the last how many years did you say
1661955 dont know hopefully we can change that this week its the same old question arises every single time i dont know ive got no answer for that all i know is that i think that there are a lot of european guys which have certainly got a big chance putting an end to that question so i dont know
1661956 its amazing that a european has not won in such a long time when you consider the strength of the european golf especially over the last few years
1661957 the likes of nick faldo and seve ballesteros and woosie ian woosnam and bernhard langer and sam torrance and people like that and monty colin montgomerie monty had a good chance at a couple and amazing that none of us would win
1661958 the greens are all the same none of the greens have been touched my notes have them to be the same as far as breaks and so forth
1661959 i think over the last 10 years maybe the last 15 years theres been a little bit of lull in european golf in terms of winning majors
1661960 so thats why there hasnt been such great form in the pga but obviously there are plenty of good european players around now and there are plenty of them capable of winning

1661969 we saw a talented young man who would like to play in the ryder cup and knew he had made a mistake and was looking to amend those mistakes i appreciated that
1661970 because they are not relevant to what the ryder cup is today

1661975 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill

1661979 das produkt wird sehr gut angenommen bereits in den ersten sechs wochen konnten wir aufschaltungen im dreistelligen bereich verzeichnen ohne das produkt aktiv beworben zu haben
1661980 we undertook a world class research effort to discover why that might have happened
1661981 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget
1661982 and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because theres enough engineers and r amp d and technology that keeps us getting longer if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway its probably a good avenue
1661983 i have no problem with that because i feel like its a challenging thing for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of rough or out of the rough
1661984 is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out
1661985 as we change the grooves were going to have to start maybe looking at the way our golf ball is performing
1661986 however i already know it moves the rule book backward
1661987 how does this help the average golfer enjoy the game more
1661988 we think were in good legal position in case a manufacturer does feel necessary to file a lawsuit
1661989 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1661990 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1661991 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1661992 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1661993 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1661994 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1661995 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1661996 news scores amp more on your cell phone get it now
1661997 because right now my season with just two wins is just ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1661998 but i was so glad that i was in a position to compete for the championship to get back into contention to have an opportunity where every putt counted and put myself in a pressure situation heading into this event i would have loved to have won last week theres no arguing that point but i really needed to be there like i was
1661999 when im playing a course im trying to take half the trouble out of play
1662000 so i want to set up down the right edge of the fairway and hit a cut and if i miss it left it doesnt bother me what bothers me is if i hook it

1662004 we have been proposing some electoral reforms for a few years but the government is dragging its feet but we keep on pursuing with them hoping that some day at least some of these things will happen
1662005 we would like criminals to be debarred but for that there has to be an act but government refuses to pass the act every political party has a lot of criminal candidates and every political party has a lot of winning criminal candidates so they dont want to pass the law
1662006 then we put it up on the website there are a couple of organisations who work closely with us and let people see but how many people in india actually will be seeing the website
1662007 we need to do a lot more to ensure that criminals cannot enter politics
1662008 extra legal device is to get a police jeep to follow criminals around with a video tape recording their every move
1662009 so this fellow the criminal candidate has to keep looking over his shoulders all the time two days he did it the third day he bolted because all this will be used against him at the time of election petitions

1662045 we are excited to begin this water recycling pilot program with devon energy and look forward to helping conserve vital water resources to produce clean energy
1662046 devon will contract with ecosphere technologies of stuart fla to operate the pilot project in johnson county the project will use a pre treatment process to remove waste constituents before the water is run through a series of membranes to remove salts the process will also treat produced water that is released from the shale with natural gas the recycled water will then be reused to hydraulically fracture the barnett shale formation the water treatment system is projected to produce 75 percent reusable fracture fluid and 25 percent high concentrate and solids the concentrate will be used as a drilling fluid or disposed of in an authorized facility
1662047 advanced drilling and fracturing technology has been critical to making the barnett shale one of the nations top natural gas fields however fresh water used to fracture the shale becomes a waste product when it picks up salt metals and hydrocarbons in the formation oil and gas field waste reduction is a priority at the commission and i commend devon and other operators who continue to seek ways to reduce frac fluid and produced water waste
1662048 the process being tested in this unique pilot program will use a low energy and low cost pre treatment system to remove most of the contaminates before the water is filtered through membranes innovations like this system will help the oil and gas industry to find economical ways to transform a waste product into a reusable fluid

1662061 food supplies are urgently needed in somalia but deteriorating security has made delivery difficult by land and sea
1662062 canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de quebec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports
1662063 canada calls on all actors to respect international humanitarian law and ensure full safe and unhindered access to assist those in need
1662064 canada is a dedicated supporter of the wfp and the deployment of the hmcs ville de quebec to somalia is yet another example of our commitment to those suffering from hunger and food insecurity
1662065 we are the third largest contributor to the wfp this year and it is vital that the contribution weve made produces real results on the ground for those who are in need by providing this ship canada will ensure that millions of somalians receive the food aid that they so desperately need
1662066 the canadian forces contribution to this mission highlights our flexibility and determination in supporting international relief efforts
1662067 strategies that are effective for protecting critical business data that reside on servers may not be effective for laptop and desktop computers and vice versa
1662068 protecting data in both places can be complex and challenging but failure to implement a solution that provides a business with total data protection could result in catastrophic data loss and in the worst case may even mean the failure of the business that is why the combined offering of yosemite filekeeper corporate for transparent continuous data protection for the edge of the network and inmage dr scout for well accepted core protection is a powerful solution
1662069 based on the companys flagship dr scout product with technology that combines disaster recovery with cdp and solves other issues such as branch office consolidation the decision to partner with inmage was intuitive
1662070 corporations have seen the need for laptop protection for years but because of the complexity of most laptop protection products they have left it up to the users to copy files to a file share with the simplicity of filekeeper corporate and the combination with dr scout customers can be assured that their information is always protected
1662071 yosemites filekeeper corporate solution is well known for its set it and forget it ease of use for protecting desktops and laptops
1662072 combining this with robust bc dr for production servers and applications will provide customers with unprecedented data protection from the core to the edge of their network as well as a high level of peace of mind
1662073 every organisation differed in how they identified used and disseminated their key measures and what was very important in one context might be much less relevant in another
1662074 once the attention of top managers had been captured the questions that they asked typically led to managers throughout the organisation becoming involved
1662075 measuring the value people bring to a business can be tricky but is vital to monitoring the health of your organisation
1662076 hr plays a crucial role in making the links between things such as employee engagement turnover and vacancy rates and customer satisfaction and measuring their impact
1662077 although it may seem daunting with the right planning and working closely with management people metrics can do a lot to monitor business health

1662173 however that hasnt happened what we are seeing is that many employers are increasingly focused on how to sustain and increase the engagement of their employees they are committing significant resources and time to listen carefully to all segments of their workforce and adjust the work environment their expectations of managers and leaders and their human resources programs in response to what employees are saying
1662174 to retain employees the immediate reaction of some employers particularly in alberta was to offer higher salaries
1662175 however in a tight labour market provided pay is competitive other aspects of the job become more important in an employees decision to join or stay with an organization
1662176 the flexibility i have in my work schedule is appropriate for the work that i do
1662177 providing as much flexibility as possible can certainly help to increase engagement
1662178 with an increasingly diverse workforce employers need to constantly look for ways to meet various needs for flexibility best employers have been leaders in this area for many years
1662179 its not surprising that engagement is higher at organizations where employees feel they share the same values as their employer that sense of common purpose can increase employee commitment especially amongst older workers
1662180 on the other hand a perceived lack of integrity on the part of co workers managers and leaders has as expected a detrimental effect on engagement what was perhaps unanticipated in the study findings however was the really negative opinion of the ethics of senior leadership at low engagement organizations
1662181 changing demographics are having a tremendous impact on the value organizations place on their people and the strategies developed to attract and retain employees
1662182 achieving high engagement is challenging in these circumstances but it can be done this years best employers clearly demonstrate that this is possible
1662183 our comparative data is very extensive we can help organizations understand how they compare to other organizations across a range of industries levels of engagement and demographic factors including job roles generations years of service gender etc
1662184 that kind of information can provide a real edge when competing for scarce talent

1662243 they are joint news conferences with the side purpose of trying to make the opponent look bad in some fashion if you think about the values that win debates they are the things that make for bad government instant short and snappy answers to enormously complex questions given mainly with an eye toward replays on the news and good spin in the post debate analysis
1662244 when have you ever heard a candidate say you know my opponent has a very good idea about how to deal with this problem i think we should do what he suggests we would want a president to do this if it was right for the country but we award debating points to those candidates who are witty in disparaging their opponent and who never show any hint of compromise or inconsistency
1662245 the lincoln douglas debates are complete with moral historical legal and political arguments they are thorough and sharp witted revealing of the candidates talents positions and thinking in ways contemporary debates cannot approach
1662246 all these factors have helped to make old fashioned reasoned argument the kind that anticipates an informed and interested audience obsolete
1662247 i dont entirely blame the candidates we are getting what we crave who wants to listen to three hours of debate on abortion or the iraq war when we can have rush limbaugh or jon stewart tell us whats going on

1662382 i think that the right was wrong to get hung up on homosexuality
1662383 i think we indulged prejudice in the eighties and missed the point its not gay men whore abusing women and abandoning children its straight men
1662384 and the demand for civil partnerships proper inheritance rights and equality in adoption rights from gay couples is not a rejection of commitment but a desire to see commitment celebrated and publicly embraced
1662385 i was loading up my van and saw it happen
1662386 all the air bags went off and it started to fill up with smoke the driver got out and just look at me as if to say what just happened
1662387 the girl who owned the renault was crying her eyes out apparently she had her car stolen a while ago and that was the replacement
1662388 it was quite a big bang everyone looked up and went to the windows then the police came up and asked if we could help out the scene was quite funny really
1662389 the rover car went straight into the side of the other car which somehow land on top of the other one
1662390 first we had to tow away the rover which we parked next door then we lifted up the other car off the other one and onto the side of the road
1662391 it didnt take long we did quite a good job
1662392 lifting a car is easy enough to do on a fork lift

1662394 collaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others
1662395 do i think we should have a team representing football in the 2012 olympics yes
1662396 we have to respect the views of scotland wales and northern ireland but this is an olympics that is going to take place in london in four years time theres an appetite for us to have a team
1662397 didnt we win a hockey gold medal in 1988 with all english players and one northern irish player there is precedent
1662398 i can see no good reason for not having one at all whatever it has to be comprised of we will have a team in the 2012 olympics
1662399 ill wear it when i ride my bike or scooter
1662400 theres a lot of people here helping to keep us safe its wonderful that theyre here
1662401 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1662402 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients
1662403 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1662404 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1662405 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1662406 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
1662407 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap
1662408 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1662409 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1662410 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1662411 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1662412 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1662413 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1662414 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1662415 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1662416 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1662417 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties
1662418 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1662419 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1662420 after reviewing all of the facts in what is the most gruesome death penalty case i have reviewed since being in office i have decided not to grant jose medellin a 30 day reprieve
1662421 put his foot on her throat because she would not die
1662422 put simply the united states seeks the help of the state of texas
1662423 in the nine months since we got preliminary approval the governor declared a statewide drought theres been a water state of emergency in nine counties in northern california and the agricultural industry in san diego has had 30 percent of its water cut
1662424 things are getting bad theres no silver bullet here but were also not going to conserve and recycle our way out of this water crisis
1662425 today there are 21 000 desalination plants producing 3 billion gallons of drinking water a day in 120 countries around the world
1662426 theyre just asking us to buy a pig in a poke and weve never done that
1662427 i just dont understand why they think the coastal commission can be satisfied with a mitigation plan that is missing major elements
1662428 cutting body parts from the victim and eating those body parts
1662429 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1662430 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1662431 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1662432 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1662433 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1662434 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1662435 was never considered to be a disciplinary problem in any sense
1662436 its unconscionable its inexcusable i dont know what you want it to call to attack a 78 year old

1662441 my mom remembers thinking it was unusual that i was there for educational issues and that he would take me into an exam room unattended
1662442 but my mom didnt want to protest because she trusted him
1662443 is why this was allowed to go on for so long
1662444 he had a huge follow up population of kids who have been coming back over and over
1662445 a thorough assessment includes a complete physical and neurological examination
1662446 examination of a childs genitals can give the doctor important information about genetic disorders physical maturity hormone problems hernias or conditions relating to the testicles and other medically important issues
1662447 every time the kids come in they dont need a complete physical examination
1662448 he is more thorough and more traditional than the average practitioner
1662449 while my son and i were on the way to childrens hospital he told me that he was frightened about the examination
1662450 dr levine would always examine his testicles while chris penis touched or was located very close to the doctors cheek
1662451 dr levine would lay me on the examination table nude
1662452 if you dont believe them you are not going to respond in a way that implies guilt
1662453 to me the most disturbing element is for young children and young adolescents to be examined without a parent
1662454 those same hands that once screwed tight our handcuffs now hold out their palms in reconciliation
1662455 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repression
1662456 he not only lived through it but through his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1662457 he is a great citizen of russia and my favorite writer
1662458 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1662459 i dont think this is a very good time to raise fees for builders
1662460 you just arent going to get the revenue you need to make a difference

1662463 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements

1662482 e government wird bereits jetzt in liechtenstein sehr erfolgreich praktiziert wie in sterreich werden auch bei uns bereits sehr viele beh rdeng nge ber das internet angeboten dieses angebot wird bei uns im land sehr gut angenommen

1662484 damit hat der sterreichische gesetzgeber die fr here verfassungsrechtslage nach der die stimmabgabe mit wenigen ausnahmen nur vor einer wahlbeh rde zul ssig war klar abge ndert in zukunft k nnte damit auch der weg frei sein f r andere formen des w hlens ausserhalb des wahllokals

1662503 stanno conducendo indagini su larga scala per stabilire come mai il clima dellartico stia diventando pi freddo e perch alcune zone del mar glaciale artico siano diventate negli ultimi tempi minacciosamente pi spesse e se lestensione di questa coltre ghiacciata contribuisca a preparare nuove ere glaciali
1662504 gli scienziati sempre loro temono che lequilibrio climatico nel mondo stia per finire
1662505 dallo studio di campioni di ghiaccio estratti dalla calotta groenlandese sembra che 89 500 anni fa qualcosa di catastrofico abbia modificato il clima portandolo da una temperatura maggiore di quella odierna a quella di una piena era glaciale
1662506 il clima del mondo sta cambiando di questo gli scienziati immancabili sono fermamente convinti ma perch e in quale direzione lo stia facendo oggetto di un acceso dibattito
1662507 questinverno chicago rimasta paralizzata dalla neve linverno scorso fu boston europea ha visto il dicembre pi freddo da un secolo a questa parte
1662508 gli scienziati arieccoli hanno resuscitato la controversa idea che milioni di miglia cubiche di ghiaccio antartico possano in certi casi scivolare improvvisamente dal continente nel mare col risultato di incrementare spaventosamente il livello degli oceani e accelerare il drammatico raffreddamento del clima mondiale
1662509 alcune scoperte nellartico confermano la teoria dellinnalzamento delle temperature globali un misterioso riscaldamento del clima si sta lentamente manifestando nellartico dando vita a un serio problema internazionale lo ha detto oggi il dr hans ahlmann noto geofisico svedese
1662510 la teoria che il mondo si stia lentamente riscaldando ha ricevuto nuove conferme dai dati delle temperature
1662511 il nostro clima sta forse cambiando il succedersi di estati temperate e di inverni miti da diversi anni a questa parte culminato lo scorso inverno nella quasi totale assenza di croste di ghiaccio nella valle dellhudson rende questa domanda pertinente i concittadini pi anziani ci dicono che gli inverni non sono pi freddi come quando loro erano giovani e noi tutti abbiamo potuto notare una notevole diminuzione media del freddo in questultimo decennio

1663244 realmente la participaci n ciudadana la solidaridad de los fragatinos y la labor de los m s j venes en varios proyectos de cooperaci n fueron el punto de partida para que los citados jardines se llamaran catarina y las calles adyacentes adquirieran nombres de pa ses sudamericanos

1663270 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in
1663271 the current cooling of the property market is making homeowners think twice about selling up and many are opting to improve instead in a buoyant market people taking on a home improvement project could get away with less than perfect preparation or some slapdash sums as their mistakes were covered by rising property prices however in todays environment it is vital you plan any project thoroughly to ensure maximum return on investment
1663272 whether the motivation is a quick sale adding long term value or accommodating changing lifestyle needs its vital homeowners consider the financial investment theyre about to make a personal loan can provide a hassle free affordable way of spreading the cost
1663273 activ8 provides a new and innovative way of doing more business
1663274 it is a unique sales aid which acts as a performance support tool and offers sales teams a significant competitive advantage it can be used as a sales tool motivation tool and training tool and thanks to mobile communications technology can be accessed and used almost anywhere in the world
1663275 this makes it not only applicable but attractive to multinational organisations which can use it for all their sales staff around the world
1663276 it allows senior managers to communicate directly with sales executives and so removes the possibility of potentially damaging chinese whispers within organisations
1663277 this use of smartphone technology not only makes the sales teams more efficient and effective but it also saves money for example enabling the sales teams to remain in the field rather than bringing them to a central location to receive more formal training in product updates regulatory and compliance issues and so on
1663278 activ8 is primarily intended for use in industry sectors which have widely dispersed and often mobile sales forces this includes not only the retail motor industry where manufacturers dealerships are widespread throughout the country but also the pharmaceutical and perhaps financial services sectors among others
1663279 moreover while we push information to the users activ8 also collects key performance data and produces management reports on the systems usage
1663280 activ8 should easily justify its costs and produce a highly positive return on investment because it provides fast up to the minute effective communications to the people who most directly affect your organisations sales performance this new sales aid which addresses the needs of todays rapidly developing marketplace should bring users significant competitive advantages

1663304 i think theres not an insignificant chance of an interest rate rise primarily because the quarterly inflation report is out this month and one member of the mpc has said that it is a good time to explain a rate rise
1663305 with inflation rising a hike this month could be one last signal from the bank of its commitment to bring inflation down while i predict a no change tomorrow a move in rates is not inconceivable if they are to move its more likely to go up than down
1663306 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable

1663356 today is a day of suffering we are being punished and are in disgrace we are like a woman who is ready to give birth but is too weak to do it 4 the assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living god may the lord your god hear these insults and punish those who spoke them so pray to god for those of our people who survive
1663357 the lord tells you not to let the assyrians frighten you with their claims that he cannot save you 7 the lord will cause the emperor to hear a rumor that will make him go back to his own country and the lord will have him killed there
1663358 the god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands but dont let that deceive you 11 you have heard what an assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy do you think that you can escape 12 my ancestors destroyed the cities of gozan haran and rezeph and killed the people of betheden who lived in telassar and none of their gods could save them 13 where are the kings of the cities of hamath arpad sepharvaim hena and ivvah
1663359 o lord the god of israel seated on your throne above the winged creatures you alone are god ruling all the kingdoms of the world you created the earth and the sky 16 now lord look at what is happening to us listen to all the things that sennacherib is saying to insult you the living god 17 we all know lord that the emperors of assyria have destroyed many nations made their lands desolate 18 and burned up their gods which were no gods at all only images of wood and stone made by human hands 19 now lord our god rescue us from the assyrians so that all the nations of the world will know that only you o lord are god
1663360 the city of jerusalem laughs at you sennacherib and makes fun of you
1663361 have you never heard that i planned all this long ago and now i have carried it out i gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble
1663362 but i know everything about you what you do and where you go i know how you rage against me 28 i have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours and now i will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth and take you back by the same road you came
1663363 here is a sign of what will happen this year and next you will have only wild grain to eat but the following year you will be able to plant your grain and harvest it and plant vines and eat grapes
1663364 and this is what the lord has said about the assyrian emperor he will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it no soldiers with shields will come near the city and no siege mounds will be built around it
1663365 even though the assyrians are strong and numerous they will be destroyed and disappear my people i made you suffer but i will not do it again 13 i will now end assyrias power over you and break the chains that bind you
1663366 they will have no descendants to carry on their name i will destroy the idols that are in the temples of their gods i am preparing a grave for the assyrians they dont deserve to live

1663370 the entire 30 person it department was working on aspects of the upgrade which would affect the entire company
1663371 but the primary responsibility for the upgrade fell upon the lead programmer
1663372 no one knew as much about the system as she did and cross training was at a minimum each programmer worked on his own subsystems and few had worked on the core of the program
1663373 the deadline was such a firm date that management wouldnt even let the lead programmer schedule more than three days for her honeymoon because they couldnt afford to lose that much time
1663374 finally the lead programmer realized that her only way to finish this business critical upgrade was to stop going to the meetings and work like mad
1663375 she estimated that if she worked 80 hour weeks with no interruptions she could finish and have the upgrade ready for testing in four weeks just in time for the hard deadline
1663376 but the cio apparently covered himself by reporting to the board that the situation was under control the person responsible fired and consultants hired
1663377 nine months and four consultants later the system was upgraded
1663378 all of these results will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1663379 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1663380 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the linage of pharaohs
1663381 such announcements are good for publicity they sell well in the media
1663382 the question to be resolved is whether to credit the circumstantial evidence suggesting correias guilt or the evidence suggesting his innocence
1663383 one of the most productive in a long long time
1663384 it was still by any measure an extraordinarily productive session
1663385 a lot of people know i dont get to do that all by myself i put four ideas before the legislature none of those has been enacted
1663386 meanwhile the pressure on the property taxes has continued and i think people want to see some results and frankly if someone has a better idea lets hear it
1663387 it was hard for me im not that interested in gambling per se it was the jobs and revenue that i cared about its what i still care about
1663388 there has been no decision and really no discussion on what initiative the governor might follow
1663389 its a little surprising to me to see how much of the business of the legislature is done like almost every other human institution i know anything about where it waits till the end and then theres a flurry to get it all done
1663390 we understand what they did we documented everything and we got a good record of what happened
1663391 its going to make the prioritization and choices even more difficult as we go forward about what to keep and what to cut
1663392 all the recommendations really come down to same thing which is to say the state needs to find money as part of its regular budget to begin to pay off this obligation to the tune of several hundred million dollars a year
1663393 it sets the broad parameters but it doesnt really provide an answer and all the hard work remains namely what are we going to cut to fit this into the state budget because theres no new revenue source
1663394 tackled the challenge of beginning to address how we are going to provide for public sector retirees
1663395 but as the report makes clear it will take discipline political will and a lot of money to do this right
1663396 we dare not fail because the price and consequences of inaction are huge
1663397 it can be done with less pain today than if we put it off but its not easy
1663398 there is that 800 pound gorilla out there waiting to be fed and the liability is not going to get smaller because healthcare costs are going up
1663399 if they achieve better results than the indexes and their peer group then we are doing well and they should be rewarded
1663400 if we have people who beat those returns the way i see it is that the pensioners have done well
1663401 michael travaglini reviewed the staff evaluations and salary recommendations with the administration and audit committee board members on july 24 2008
1663402 to bring about positive civic change through forceful editorial writing and serving as an insightful authoritative source inside and outside the newsroom for developments that impact

1663404 steadfast support for the peoples right to know and the first amendment in both the newsroom and the front office and exemplary outreach efforts to connect the globe to the broad and diverse community it serves
1663405 he wanted me to leave michael for a couple of months but the only way that he and i would have the opportunity to be together was if something happened to michael
1663406 i feel guilty and unclean because i wanted to be with his wife
1663407 but to be perfectly honest with you ive had the thought of geez if michael had an accident and that kills me
1663408 ive had thoughts where i wished michael wasnt with you and its like you know be careful what you wish for
1663409 i was seen i was here i spoke with somebody
1663410 middle school students motivations are different and the mcas is not high stakes for them like it is for high school students
1663411 if middle school students are having a bad day it totally throws off their test scores
1663412 the state should pay more attention to the middle school level
1663413 often middle school is a critical transition for students from the more protective environment of an elementary school to the more complex social and academic challenges of a secondary school
1663414 i dont like to play games i just like to learn i need to improve in math and english
1663415 there has been longstanding confusion of what the focus of middle schools should be
1663416 if we want to compete with the rest of world and if we want kids to succeed they need to learn at high levels and having these few years of hitting the pause button has been disastrous
1663417 kids at this age need a lot of structure and unconditional love and people to be tough on them
1663418 you cant go after kids with extra mcas help all the time
1663419 but eventually you stop making excuses and start being honest and reflecting its hard to admit things could be better
1663420 i did nothing in my time leaving to enhance my position at all
1663421 i was outraged at the 100 percent policy and asked him to re look at it
1663422 i cant use the words i said in this setting
1663423 i was outraged that he put that into effect i said that it was unacceptable
1663424 we put more people on bikes well have less congestion
1663425 with the environment being a number one issue we have to be a part of that
1663426 but having bike lanes just from the bu bridge to kenmore is a short stretch
1663427 why tromp across a yacht club that has very limited access to the water when you can go up to the blue hills and walk around for miles
1663428 at the end of the day these are public assets and the public has a right of access
1663429 if theyre using a public asset they need to be paying for it and remembering that its public
1663430 a lot of people have a lot of money invested in their boats
1663431 could be any number of things like access to a restroom taking down some of the fence or letting people walk in front of the building
1663432 if we didnt supervise it we would really be worried about vandalism
1663433 i dont know of one club that has ever turned away anybody whos knocked on their door and said i really need to use your bathroom
1663434 actresses like me might be asked to play more stereotyped roles
1663435 you have to respect other peoples culture customs and needs its a delicate situation
1663436 im not just a white face with brown hair and blue eyes
1663437 youre always a foreigner you can never break out and become one of them
1663438 i want to make the western character a real person
1663439 even if they start as a stereotype i have the power to try to change it
1663440 they sit on the steps every day but they dont do anything wrong
1663441 its unfortunate but more and more over the last few years thats what were seeing 15 16 17 year olds with guns trying to resolve their problems that way
1663442 he was on the platform and just prior to 12 30 as the amtrak westbound train approached the station he jumped off the platform ran across the eastbound tracks scaled the chain link fence and then fell onto the tracks just as the westbound train arrived
1663443 its a horrible thing and i feel very bad for the driver
1663444 its somewhat affordable but its not reliable the other morning they canceled the train with no explanation and i was pushed up against the exit door the whole ride into north station cause it was so crowded
1663445 i already feel like i pay a little too much for what i get
1663446 the last thing in the world we need at this point in time is a fare increase
1663447 all it will do is drive people away from the system at a time when we want more people and not fewer riding it
1663448 no no no theyre crazy theyre out of their mind and its not fair
1663449 these will be not be public meetings and no public funds will be expended
1663450 im questioning the legality of it and the wisdom of it
1663451 its raising awareness in the community this isnt just a school issue its not just a city issue its also about families taking responsibility and providing them with awareness
1663452 really the heart of our work is to help people have difficult conversations
1663453 i would never wear one it makes you look like a woman
1663454 when i hit the water i feel like a rocket
1663455 when i left the water i felt like the entire place was laughing at me

1663482 w hrend des kommunismus waren die polnischen bisch fe und priester eng mit bestimmten laien verbunden denen sie vertrauen konnten
1663483 ich habe die handy nummern der bisch fe immer gespeichert bei mir

1663492 die k nstler denken zu viel dar ber nach was der kirche wohl gefallen k nnte das kann nichts werden

1663516 i lost my son and my daughter is now handicapped because of the mines near our farm
1663517 we never know were to step and had called many times for the government to clean the area but in vain had i to lose a child to bring some attention to our area
1663518 the mines are everywhere every year we hear that they are going to take it away but it never happens
1663519 we just get promises and while it doesnt happen we keep losing our children as result of an unfair war that never ends
1663520 all attention has been switched to the security situation of the country leaving the mines clearance behind although it has the same importance
1663521 millions of funds have been allocated to security concern while mines clearance are receiving little attention
1663522 residents of rural areas are more vulnerable to the danger of landmines especially for being mostly illiterate people
1663523 they dont accept losing part of their lands to the mines and sometimes insist on farming cultivating and raising their cattle in these areas becoming an easy target
1663524 some people depend on these areas to survive and although we try to make them aware of the situation they want to support their families and just choose to ignore the danger
1663525 i lost my wife and daughter because of the landmines but i dont have choice and have to keep working in the land
1663526 i have two choices the first is taking the risk and feed my family with my income and the other is to die from hungry i prefer the first option because at least i will know that im trying to survive and god will help me for this reason

1663562 the paramount reason for making meditation a part of our daily life is to join forces with our sacred energy and regain the power of our source god through meditation we can tap in to an abundance of creative energy that resides within us and a more meaningful experience of life which enriches us permanently by meditating we come to know god rather than knowing about god

1663589 germanys high court says smoking bans in two states are unconstitutional a decision which will force country wide reviews of smoking prohibitions
1663590 the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe today ruled on appeals brought by the owners of one room pubs in the states of baden wuerttemberg and berlin
1663591 most german states currently allow larger establishments to have smoking rooms but the court ruled that this discriminates against the single room pubs which cant offer smoking areas the court says either states have to eliminate smoking entirely in all establishments or change their rules regarding the smaller pubs it gave state parliaments until the end of next year to come up with new laws
1663592 today the german federal constitutional court ruled that smoking must be allowed in small pubs formally this decision is valid only in the laender states berlin and baden wuerttemberg but it will change the law in the other laender as well
1663593 up to the moment smoking was banned in all small one room pubs whilst in larger pubs smoking could be allowed in a separate smokers room in germany smoking is also allowed in all private clubs so many former pubs closed formally and refounded themselves as members only smokers clubs
1663594 in germany it is unconstitunal to ban smoking in private clubs and instutions which are formally private rooms you may become a member of such a smoking club by signing a list stating your personal data which includes a declaration that you willingly join the club understanding that there might be a danger by smoke or even second hand smoke and mostly by paying a nominal one time fee
1663595 the best solution for germany the uk and the rest of europe is to follow the spanish example whereby bars and restaurants over 100 square metres can opt to have a separate smoking room smaller establishments can choose to be
1663596 good luck to you when you finally manage to escape this sorry excuse for a country

1663716 its a worry for patients who will be the ones who suffer if something goes wrong
1663717 doctors should not be working excessive hours we want the scottish government to supply highly trained doctors and enough of them so they are not harassed when they are trying to meet targets
1663718 health boards should be telling the scottish government that there are not enough doctors they must have figured out that more need to be trained up
1663719 nhs lothian has made good progress every year in reducing junior doctors hours in order to meet the european working time regulation and we are currently ahead of most health boards in scotland
1663720 we are working towards ensuring all members of staff meet the 48 hour limit by next august and are on target to meet this
1663721 one of the areas where we are not complying is our transplant surgery rota these are committed members of staff who feel they have to work these hours to provide a service to transplant patients
1663722 most of the retrieval of organs takes place in evenings and at weekends and operations mainly start very early in the morning
1663723 these doctors and nhs lothian realise that we must meet the european working time regulation in order to offer a safe service
1663724 this will involve potentially recruiting additional members of staff rearranging staff rotas and ensuring that all members of staff take their full rest entitlement
1663725 hours have been steadily coming down from the mid 90s when they were 100 hours a week average
1663726 this is all about engaging with the community which is something the army were traditionally known for but which has perhaps fallen by the wayside a little in recent years for the simple reason that most soldiers have been away on deployment for long periods
1663727 we want to try and reconnect with people and show them what the army stands for the kind of leadership we can provide but it is not a recruitment drive
1663728 we have chosen a story that is not about the army directly but which highlights the core values we believe are important
1663729 people will often judge the military because they have a political reaction to a conflict and they pass that on to the military who are not political they are just doing a very important job
1663730 we want to show the positive values we believe in such as overcoming adversity and showing courage and loyalty
1663731 im sick of these people many of whom arent even from the area hanging around a main entrance to shops and a swimming pool
1663732 why should grannies doing their shopping and mothers taking their kids to the swimming pool have to see these derelicts drink themselves into oblivion
1663733 some people can hardly believe how many people just stand there and drink when it is raining they even do it under umbrellas its good to see that this tactic has worked and it has to be continued until they get the message and start drinking in their own homes
1663734 it does seem to be working we knew over the summer there would be an increase in children using the swimming pool and it had to be addressed
1663735 the public toilet in particular is a popular place for people in pursuit of drugs to meet and greet then go in to exchange them
1663736 i wouldnt say this foot patrols is an old fashioned tactic because we have always done it
1663737 you cant beat good old fashioned policing it always works people say there arent enough of them on the streets but i think its more they dont have enough powers to command respect
1663738 as a community we really welcome what they have done there and it has made a difference
1663739 if were honest leith walk has been in a bit of a state because of the trams and i think it would be good to see someone co ordinating efforts to rejuvenate the area
1663740 it is simply a case of trying to get some joined up thinking and having someone to champion leith as a destination for shoppers but also trying to get some of the empty shop units filled
1663741 i would envisage the money from this coming out of ties budget but longer term we could be looking at a town manger type role for leith
1663742 anything that can benefit the people and traders of leith has to be welcomed i dont think people realise that it will take some time for leith to recover from all of the disruption from the tram works
1663743 people do get out of the habit of visiting places or taking certain routes around the city so we do need someone to remind everyone that we are still here and very much open
1663744 this is an interesting idea having a person who can pull together all the different interests of leith will be really useful but also someone who can work through the remaining tram works and make it as pain free as possible would also be helpful

1663748 were working with c venues to find out why todays performance was oversold
1663749 this venue like many other university buildings has been hired by a production company during the fringe festival we will be working with the production company involved to establish how this happened
1663750 the overspend in 2007 8 was largely a result of under investment and because demand for services has increased
1663751 an additional 2 2m was needed to deliver care at home services for older people this was addressed by allocating additional money in this years budget
1663752 another contribution to the overspend can be attributed to one off events such as the governments free personal care policy over 1m had to be reimbursed for meal preparation charges which were wrongly charged based on government guidance
1663753 we are facing huge demographic pressures and it is vital we shift the balance of care towards supporting people in their own homes for longer this was reflected in our budget
1663754 cllr paul edie has written in a departmental magazine saying that he is starting 2008 9 with a clean sheet hes actually starting with a 5m overspend that he was in charge of
1663755 i dont see how this wont have an effect on frontline services this money has to be found from somewhere
1663756 more and more people need these services but the money isnt there

1663760 we were sitting watching the show and about half an hour into it there was a crashing noise from above because it was dark we didnt know what it was and a split second later something came out of nowhere and crashed on to her
1663761 she screamed straight away and didnt stop screaming until after we got to the hospital we werent sure where the cut was to begin with because there was a lot of blood it was horrible seeing my own daughter like that
1663762 we were inspected before the start of the fringe and this has just been an unfortunate accident
1663763 obviously we kept in touch with the family of the little girl and we sent her a big bouquet of flowers it was great to hear that she is all right and we would be delighted to welcome her back to see any show here
1663764 its put me off no more fringe for me just now
1663765 one of the english languages most demanding roles and survives
1663766 at the moment no housebuilders can get hold of the cash they are not interested in looking at any development because of the mortgage market and the bank lending isnt available for them
1663767 with housing associations their bank debt is arranged over a much larger time period and they do have funding available now
1663768 the big difference is that this will deliver housing where it is needed
1663769 there is going to be pressure on sales and mortgages for the next year or two and if we see any opportunities to provide affordable housing then it will be a great benefit for the city
1663770 the current credit crunch has deepened edinburghs housing crisis we are very glad to receive innovative proposals for new affordable housing as with our own recently announced plans to build the first council homes for a generation this plan supports research showing that such communities are by far the most successful
1663771 the disability equality forum werent consulted to my knowledge its completely shocking
1663772 the aim of the a to z is to inform the public of the council services available to them which is why it does not contain information about outside organisations
1663773 contact numbers rather than names are provided so that people can access the information they want as easily as possible
1663774 a number of organisations took part in a focus group about their effectiveness in late 2005 but they are not regularly consulted
1663775 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1663776 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1663777 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1663778 i was absolutely stunned and i was very angry i just dont know why they didnt divert the plane
1663779 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1663780 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1663781 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process
1663782 we will catch more people if we have the english dna database an even more complete system is to say we will go the whole hog forget criminality well take dna from everyone in the country
1663783 if the public decide they want to do it you would do it gradually
1663784 i am delighted to see north berwick and east lothian council setting such a good example by choosing safe working practices and encouraging the community to adopt them too
1663785 falls from height are one of the biggest causes of workplace accidents but can be prevented and avoided by planning ahead and selecting the right equipment for the job
1663786 the residents on the north berwick in bloom committee are tremendously dedicated and make an excellent job in keeping the town smart and colourful we always try and help them to keep the town looking at its best and we want to do it as safely as possible
1663787 in our job we work with some potentially dangerous equipment so health and safety is always at the forefront of our minds
1663788 a huge amount of work has gone into producing this document which matches the priorities for the city with the priorities identified for the country
1663789 edinburgh has long been recognised as the main engine of economic growth and wealth creation in scotland so i am also delighted that we have the opportunity to discuss directly the priorities we all have

1663820 hey isnt there the danger that some of us might pick up a nasty bug if we go to west africa
1663821 ebanks blake is so strong and powerful he would run through brick walls to score goals
1663822 he loves to run at defenders too and i reckon if him and keogh get 35 40 goals between them then wolves will go up
1663823 he also likes to play off the last defender which is what i used to do but he will be a marked man this year after winning the golden boot and he will have to deal with that
1663824 having been there myself you have to make sure youre fitter than the other bloke but he looks hungry and capable of doing that as for keogh i think hes got the right attitude this season last season i think he thought he was going to be sold but they have struck up a good partnership
1663825 it doesnt mean anything in terms of added pressure or anything like that but its nice as a striker to wear the number nine
1663826 i know fans will do that sort of thing and its all part of their love for the club
1663827 predecessors have worn it and done really well but its still only a number and for me you can never really judge a career until the career is over or almost finished
1663828 its unfair after one season to make comparisons with someone who had 12 good seasons for me its not about comparisons at this moment in time let me have my career and then look back and if ive been successful we can talk about it
1663829 im just pleased to wear the number and just hope i can continue to do what ive been doing for this club
1663830 ive watched my favourite player andy cole wear the number nine at manchester united so its good
1663831 i think its a reward for hard work that the gaffer has given it his blessing
1663832 keogh was nine but hes worn number 10 for a long time during his career so he was quite happy to switch
1663833 we knew number 10 was going to be vacant and i was offered that
1663834 but we had a chat and obviously players like certain numbers not superstition or anything but just what they like wearing
1663835 keogh likes 10 and was happy to take it which made nine available and i grabbed it with both hands
1663836 i wore nine at plymouth and also in uniteds reserves
1663837 its always been my number and so im really pleased to get it again
1663838 the number nine wont add any pressure just as ive already said being top scorer last season wont add any pressure
1663839 myself and the team have just got to try and work harder than we did last season and see where it takes us
1663840 all good things in life come from hard work and i think if you set a base with that everything else that comes with it is deserved thats always been my ambition
1663841 weve got almost two players for every position in the squad and very good players at that
1663842 unfortunately only 11 can play on the day but football now is very much a squad game because there are so many games to be played
1663843 it keeps you on your toes but thats good for a professional in any job
1663844 you have to know that the pressure is on and youve got to perform week in week out it gives you an extra edge and ensures you dont get into any comfort zone
1663845 none of us will be guilty of that this year i can guarantee that

1663898 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1663899 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1663942 this year we saw all the same companies return to exhibit at maats and more the slight attendance decrease can be attributed to the fact that returning companies brought less people to the show
1663943 in fact we had a larger number of buyers attend this years show than last year the 400 total buyers doesnt take into account the buyer cross over we saw from icast which doesnt record those numbers
1663944 the feedback we received from maats exhibitors regarding the shared show floor was overwhelmingly positive
1663945 exhibitors and buyers alike felt the shared space created an increased buzz for both shows and provided each venues participants with new business opportunities
1663946 this large dealer turnout signals great potential for the shows future
1663947 were planning to roll out a full marketing plan to attract even more dealers to maats in 2009

1663963 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1663964 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1663965 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1663966 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1663967 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1663968 my understanding is hes certainly said that he would respect those rules when hes in the venues and i hope thats the case
1663969 our position is that we respect the right of athletes to take a position on human rights all those matters weve given them the opportunity personally on blogs personally at conferences like this youre free to ask these athletes whatever questions you want here

1663973 sencillamente recib un llamado telef nico en el que me comunicaron que debido a que iban a trasladar de lugar la antena de la emisora el programa no iba a salir entonces pregunte por cuantos d as a lo que me respondieron que no sab an que pod an ser 2 meses o mas por lo que en realidad el programa estaba fuera
1663974 este no es el primer apriete que sufro en esta emisora hace un par de meses un funcionario ligado a esta radio me llamo personalmente para hacerme saber en muy malos t rminos que mi programa no se correspond a a la l nea editorial de la radio en ese momento trate de dialogar y limar asperezas ampar ndome en el sentido com n y en su cercan a a esta profesi n pero no fue posible
1663975 a pesar de que el compromiso contractual entre el programa y la emisora tiene vigencia hasta diciembre esto tampoco parece importarle a las autoridades de la radio o de la fundaci n que en teor a maneja esta radio de todas maneras lo que mas me sorprende es que en una radio en la que siempre se abog por los derechos humanos el libre acceso a la informaci n y la libertad de expresi n en tan solo 7 meses eso haya pasado a la historia tambi n que una radio que ha intentado y generado alianzas estrechando v nculos con radios cooperativas del pa s y de latinoam rica y redes como farco que realmente dedican su trabajo y sus esfuerzos a esos ideales hoy sean participes de un acto de censura encubierto tan solo por no coincidir con sus ideas y pensamientos pol ticos
1663976 por no coincidir con la l nea editorial de la emisora

1663980 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good

1664007 hoy hay que trabajar todos juntos y me gustar a que vayamos a gestionar a buenos aires obras que nos faltan en tierra del fuego gestionemos para destrabar fondos porque hoy la situaci n de la provincia no le permite invertir en infraestructura
1664008 si el posicionamiento pol tico es m o espero que sea respetado porque a m me vot la gente yo le respondo a la gente y habr a que preguntarle a los concejales de otros partidos porqu piensan igual que yo
1664009 si encima que el gobierno no nos paga y por otro lado nos sacan fondos esto perjudica la econom a de r o grande
1664010 en principio lo positivo ha sido poder expresarle la situaci n habitacional de r o grande en particular y partir de all se plantearon las acciones desarrolladas en r o grande tal es el caso de chacra 11 y lo proyectado hacia adelante y se ha planteado la necesidad de contar con estos fondos que se piensan desafectar de los recursos municipales en conclusi n hemos planteado la oposici n a este proyecto de ley habidas cuentas de que consideramos nos quita la posibilidad de dar m s respuestas en lo habitacional y digo esto porque la municipalidad tiene previsto aportar los 30 millones de deuda del gobierno para destinarlos a soluciones habitacionales o infraestructura y tal cual lo hemos planteado esto se agrava porque adem s de la deuda se descuentan 8 millones m s y es complicado para la ciudad porque resta margen de acci n y as se explic claramente
1664011 se ha planteado claramente y concretamente que si la provincia ha planteado la posibilidad de que se realice alg n aporte del orden de los 16 millones de pesos que los aportes en dos o tres a os de la deuda entonces el n mero se eleva a cerca de 46 millones para fondos de infraestructura y a su vez hemos sugerido que se vea la situaci n de r o grande en particular
1664012 esta fue tomada como una alternativa y han planteado este proyecto como una alternativa a discutir y ma ana es la sesi n por lo que no hay margen para plantear cambios o modificaciones al proyecto de ley y veremos en la sesi n si se da alg n tipo de cambio
1664013 sigo convencida que esta ley es superadora de la ley 746 y el fondo es simplemente un art culo de la ley
1664014 creo que no se entendi el objeto del proyecto lo trabajamos desde lo que fue nuestra experiencia en la mesa institucional y tambi n como ejecutivo municipal en poder integrar a la comuna con el ejecutivo
1664015 tanto el intendente como el gobierno posee sus responsabilidades los jefes comunales deber adjudicar las tierras urbanizar y prestar los servicios le quedar al gobierno gestionar los fondos

1664021 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1664022 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1664023 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1664024 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1664025 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1664026 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1664027 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons

1664044 die forderung nach einberufung einer sitzung des kontrollausschusses des k rntner landtages rund um den spendenskandal um das k rntendorf in banda aceh ist hinf llig zumal er mit der causa bereits befasst ist
1664045 aufgrund des vorliegens des rechnungshofberichtes ist der kontrollausschuss bereits t tig geworden und wird sich in seiner n chsten sitzung anfang september mit dem spendenskandal um das k rntendorf banda aceh befassen

1664050 es ist bedauerlich welchen stil der vp verkehrssprecher in der laufenden wahlauseinandersetzung w hlt
1664051 der versuch einen erfolgreichen verkehrsminister schlecht zu machen ist nur aus wahltaktischen gr nden zu erkl ren
1664052 ich zum beispiel habe mit dem herrn kollegen faymann ein ganz ausgezeichnetes verh ltnis und wir sprechen auch ber die grunds tzlichen probleme des verkehrsressorts meine damen und herren die verkehrs und infrastrukturpolitik ist aus unserer sicht sehr positiv zu beurteilen mit diesem budget forcieren wir den ausbau der schiene sie hat vorrang wir schaffen so die voraussetzungen f r die zukunft des standortes und f r wachstum und besch ftigung in sterreich
1664053 gerade verkehrsminister faymann habe endlich wieder zukunftsweisende projekte forciert im sinne der menschen und der umwelt
1664054 auch wir wollen eine moderne bahn und eine umfassende modernisierung des schienenverkehrs in dieser frage stimmen wir mit helmut kukacka berein
1664055 unbestritten ist auch dass faymann bei der bb wichtige reformschritte gesetzt hat
1664056 dazu ist anzumerken dass alle bestellungen durch personalberatungsagenturen begleitet und vom aufsichtsrat der jeweiligen gesellschaften beschlossen wurden es wurden bei jeder entscheidungen entsprechend der empfehlung der personalberater im sinne der besten kandidatinnen und kandidaten f r das unternehmen entschieden

1664060 die sp freut sich ber den vorsto der rzte die ebenso wie die sp der meinung sind dass der die rzte belangende teil des anfang juli gescheiterten kassenfinanzierungspaketes realisiert werden k nnte leider wollte die vp auf keinen fall teile des reformpakets fertig verhandeln und lie die verhandlungen lieber platzen als ergebnisse zu erzielen
1664061 wir k nnen sofort die gespr che wieder aufnehmen und den einen oder anderen teil der gesundheitsreform noch vor der nationalratswahl fixieren
1664062 diese wortmeldung l sst hoffen dass wir auch bei der finanzierungsfrage doch noch zu einem ergebnis kommen nachdem nun konstruktive vp kr fte wie schelling erkennen dass das reformpaket an den inneren widerspr chen der vp gescheitert ist
1664063 es liegt an der vp die gespr che wieder aufzunehmen klar ist aber auch dass die sp weiterhin an der solidarischen krankenversicherung festhalten wird dass sie keineswegs neuen selbstbehalten zustimmen und dass es einen wechsel hin zu einer versicherungspflicht weg von der solidarischen pflichtversicherung nicht geben wird

1664109 the federal open market committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1664110 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1664111 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability

1664113 i totally agree with the resolution to bring leaders like robert mugabe and omar al bashir to the court of justice to answer to the atrocities perpetrated by their regimes
1664114 go ahead and rule on your own lets see where it gets you the footage shown by channel 4 news was shot at one of the zanu pf torture camps used after the elections to coerce opposition supporters into voting for president robert mugabe
1664115 self presevation this is what mugabe and his senior government members are interested in and all of the small pawns that participated in the violence that caused tsvangirai to drop out of the presidential race will be left to their own devices and they will be forced to face the music all alone mugabe is only interested in saving his own skin some we aim to cut off their limbs some we remove their sex organs

1664124 my research on the house and the man causes me to concur the house had a history from day one built by captain samuel ham in 1809 he threw a lavish party for friends and neighbors when it was complete and after his guests left he inexplicably went upstairs and hanged himself in 1819 after marrying elizabeth clapp daughter of a wealthy merchant a young lawyer named levi woodbury bought the estate and made it his familys summer home and a working farm he used it as his new hampshire base while his career unfolded which it has been said has been unequaled by any new hampshire citizen it is ironic that shortly after the n h historical society was formed this oft overlooked man became its president neighbors did fight the loss of the house as they have been fighting encroachment from all sides ever since often at considerable expense and futile ends at the time of his death woodbury was considered the presidential probability for the democratic party of his contributions the honorable robert rantoul jr a close portsmouth friend said in his lengthy eulogy for this he struggled and toiled to this he sacrificed ease and pleasure and health and at last life itself in the protracted martyrdom of over tasked powers strained till the strings of life were broken in the service of his fellow man in this as in all things he lived quite up to the doctrine of the illustrious school to which he belonged in which jefferson madison langdon and jackson were exemplars that a statesman owes all his powers to his country

1664172 a lot of asset managers private banks and non life insurance companies with little or no exposure to subprime have been marked down almost as much as investment banks which sold the products in the first place i think theres plenty of opportunity there particularly as the middle east and sovereign wealth funds have been looking for those assets to be managed
1664173 smaller companies that are extremely well capitalized and can choose over medium term to benefit from the issues that are hitting those larger banks that are more closely regulated by the fsa

1664177 its not about planning to go direct but the stores create a tangible experience of the brand

1664206 these airlines have no choice but to start pulling down their least efficient biggest money losing routes which are the small aircraft in those short haul routes into small and medium sized cities
1664207 at 130 a barrel for oil the airlines tell me that there is no business model that works
1664208 weve already had our first casualty expressjet announced that they were ceasing operations in september they were pulling out of over 30 markets it wasnt just monterey
1664209 because companies arent going to move to an area that doesnt have good air service
1664210 if you didnt have a railroad and you werent connected to the rest of the rail system in the country your community died
1664211 we depend on aviation to get to the majority of our communities 280 of our communities its the only way in and out
1664212 basically what that means is that those communities have no service at this time at all and so it is truly a coming crisis for us
1664213 it doesnt belong to the ceos of the airlines it doesnt belong to the shareholders of the airlines it belongs to all americans
1664214 on average only three passengers are flying each of these flights so were paying a significant subsidy to fly mostly empty airplanes
1664215 consumers have already backed out of this theyre already going to the major airports
1664216 the only people who cant seem to back out of it is congress because this is a nice little gift to give their districts
1664217 they want to know how high its gonna get because theyre hearing a lot of things people are talking outrageous numbers and they want to know if its true
1664218 in the early days of my career if a price moved half a cent or penny on a day that would be probably a lot
1664219 if youre within terms you can pick up oil and if youre not you can pound salt
1664220 and thats just the way it is i hope we never get to that point and have to deal with our customers that way but thats the way it is on the other side of our business
1664221 they may be buying oil at a higher price than they can sell it for or more likely the customer simply cant afford to buy it
1664222 so now they have oil they have to pay for and they cant get rid of
1664223 i think that they understand that were the middleman in this
1664224 we have probably another 10 to 20 years at least of life as we know it in the fuel business

1664251 we could get back to a 100 lb in 2009 and beyond that the long term outlook for the uranium price will probably be in the 70 80
1664252 we were looking at the environment that we live in looking for the forecast for the next 24 36 months and said this would be a good time to do it
1664253 i have a very positive outlook on the uranium market if you look at the production of nuclear power stations throughout the world that number is increasing
1664254 we have a marketing agreement whereby constellation will market our uranium in the same way nil did
1664255 so in terms of those contracts the rationale was simply to move our production to as much of a spot price as possible and take us out of our historically long term contracts
1664256 we are refurbishing our uranium plant in 2011 hopefully the new plant will come on line and that might give us a slight boost in production
1664257 we had a small blip but we havent had any power cuts since then and the situation seems to have stabilised this far
1664258 clearly there is some opportunistic buying going on at the moment
1664259 we have seen numerous times over the past six months that 900 an ounce is a key support level and whenever gold has fallen below that it has recovered relatively quickly

1664319 the under realisation on fuel sales in 2007 08 when indian basket averaged usd 79 25 per barrel was over rs 77 000 crore so there is no question of a downward revision now

1664410 i see a void deeper than the night that now enshrouds us it is all it is absolute it is limitless nothing dies for nothing is born nothing fears for nothing thinks but such perfection cannot last was she born of the void or did she arrive from some other place unknown impossibly far she hungers not for meat but for knowledge her eyes ring round spin drink greedily of everything around her her hands itch yearn constantly grasping for what is out of reach for the unknown her feet do not touch any ground as she glides towards the next discovery the next new being the next satisfaction when she beheld this perfect void she wept what was there to see what was there to do what was there to learn nothing except herself and the black her brow furrowed but only for a moment if she could not find what she was looking for perhaps she could make it herself she spoke words in a language never created wove magics with her hands the loom her essence the thread she made this world in her own image from her hunger sprang the boggarts her joy created the elves her caution the kithkin her anger the cinders her despair the giants her ambition the merrow her mischief the fae her stoutness the treefolk she tried to wreathe this world in light but the void angered at the disruption of its blanket fought back and even when it won she did not despair in fact she rejoiced her sired things altered in such interesting ways that she had new purpose she walks among us unseen learning from our imperfections watching over her creations as all things sprang from her is she watching for the time when all must return to her
1664411 tell me seer what causes the mighty quakes that scare my children and send me tumbling
1664412 i see a juggernaut greater than giants and far older still he sleeps beneath the earth among those whom once he slew he bears the marks of ages upon his skin memories of dreams long dead and best left buried whenever cracks split the ground an old peak falls or hills roll like water that is the demiurge muttering in his slumber but one day his sleep will end as any sleep but death must he shall rise from his forgotten bed his is an ancient doom never spoken of but always known if only in flashes of trembling fear and he will walk the world that tried to forget him none shall ever pass where he walks his footprints are marks of grieving the greatest mountain is sand under his feet the eldest forest a single blade of grass bent and crushed under his heel all shall see his the shadow of his coming feel his stride shaking their lives apart and know that death is upon them they will scream they will curse they will beg they will run yet all these acts and yet more will cease in the same moment trod under his implacable step when he has reached his goal a trail of blood and silence stretching behind him he will say words never spoken before or since that will be etched upon his skin then he will lie upon that spot and slumber once more as the dust that falls upon him grows into hills and the wrenched fields claw slowly back to life he will sleep and one day when foolish folk once again flourish their arrogance blinding them to their own mortality the demiurge will again awake and begin his journey anew
1664413 tell me seer why does our night stretch to everlasting
1664414 i see a plain grass dyed red buzzing with flies and scattered with remnants once housed within skin he dances amongst the fleshy remnants he bathes himself in gore then licks it clean he laughs a bellowing deathly din as he slices through the heavens making them bleed yet he does more than laugh he revels the tearing of limbs is a thing of beauty to him art writ across flesh screams of torment are his favorite lullaby his pride beams beholding a misshapen thing of his own design gurgling its life out onto the soil pray to always see his glare brimming with hate and the heat of bloodlust you do not want to see him smile once upon a time he was alone a single soul screaming pitifully in a sea of life it thrived no matter how much he reaped joy was an anathema to him peace an obscenity light shone upon all buffeting and blinding him he scoured the world searching for surcease the barest hint of flaw in the gem as he knew there had to be he found it a tiny hole in the sky oozing blackness he picked at it scrabbled at it yet even his strength could not widen it in his frustration he hacked at his own flesh rending it clawing it searching for comfort victory in his own pain mortals shuddered at the sound of his ribs spreading his organs bursting finally he lay on the ground panting from his exertions when his form began to knit together in strange ways even he did not fathom when all limbs were joined anew and life returned to muscles there stood now two of him where there had only been one united in purpose and hate roaring with unholy joy the two tore at each other reveling in their agonies then those four did the same those eight the same those sixteen the same until a damned army hurtled towards the sky they tore wide the hole and chortled at the darkness now gushing forth the hole grew wider a swallowing mouth that consumed the sky and all its light that my dear is why we live in darkness and why we live in fear of what lies within it
1664415 tell me seer with the gloom all about us why do elves still hope
1664416 i see a sun a great sphere of light brighter still than the moon warming yet it sleeps does it fear the depravity that it would behold were it awake is it bewitched or is it merely ignorant of the suffering it causes from its slumber whatever the truth it has its worshippers it has its protectors she always runs there is always somewhere she must be with great haste she is all that mortals desire but do not deserve patron protector mother she blinds herself with a cloth over her eyes for she does not wish to give herself the gift of sight until all the world has something they wish to see she holds a shield not to guard herself but that which she holds dear she holds a spear not to slay foes but to warn them before they draw near and thus avoid bloodshed she is a living bastion a fortress that walks to offer her walls to those in need some say she hid the sun herself a desperate act to save it from its ultimate extinction others claim she seeks the sleeper a quest that spans more generations of mortals than are capable of recording it still other claim there is no sun that she deceives those she most loves lest they wither from the despair of the truth of all the children of shadowmoor the elves are her favorite their dawnglove is marked with the barest hint of her touch the glowmoths are her tears fluttering on the wind as long as she runs as long as she fights the elves will always hope even in the midst of crushing night but should they ever forget her or should she ever fall some say it will not only be the doom of the elves but the doom of us all
1664417 i see a great chariot hear the snap of the whip as its flame arcs against the sky like a bloody smile the snorting of the rams their heated breath scorching the ground its driver its master sees the world from behind the pommel of an upraised sword his enemies are legion for they ever shift with the content of his troops he knows no loyalty except to himself and those he claims to know the better to find a willing army many peoples know him by many names yet the myths are the same his great coming ablaze shining in his godhood the speeches the rallies his sugared tongue setting torch to the kindling of prejudice and fear the great war led under his crimson standard that scythes down all that once stood tall and proud the aftermath of wailing and pain in which he never figures at all he is a smith of war he stokes fervor from glowing ember to white flame hammers hot and pliable minds forges soldiers out of the rough dross of peaceful life his conquerors voice never meets silence it is answered with shouts of rage roars of approval a deadly din that lifts his spirit you see blood is his wine the clash of swords his song he does more than revel in it he feeds off it a great siege is a banquet to him a long and terrible battle the most exquisite delicacy each life crushed under the heel of war is a grape its sweet juice trickling down his throat he cares not for the lands he conquers nor the ones left burning and fallow he always knows there is another land another army over the bloodstained horizon without warfare without all its aspects the fervor the pride the sacrifice the bloodshed he would cease to exist and that my dear is why we cannot even imagine a world without war he wont let us
1664418 tell me seer why can some not act as one mind one soul as we kithkin do
1664419 i see a scepter that has met many a brow in a ringing impact the hand that holds it so tightly wields it with careless yet oh so careful abandon his eyes see only what other eyes value lucky coin trusted sword firstborn to him nothing has worth unless it belongs to someone else it is not the lust for wealth that drives him simply the hunters thrill and the moment of acquisition nothing is truly your own it is his whether you know it or not the scepter is a relic of a famed victim once there was a king whether of elves kith boggart or something else entirely only the dead can say he had gold jewels silks all the riches of the world at his command until the day the demigod came his power wafting off his skin like heat struck with fear the king asked what the demigod wanted the reply simply the most precious thing you own if i get it i will spare the rest of your wealth will you give it willingly the king pondered was it his diamond as clear as a childs eyes or his tapestry woven from the rarest cloths whatever it was surely losing it was better than losing the rest the king agreed in the next moment his soul was sucked from his body into his scepter as the king fell dead the demigod took the scepter its former owners soul still screaming within and left the two keep counsel to this day do you see my dear with such a threat clutching hands grow tighter suspicious eyes narrow scheming minds inflame when those who have must constantly defend against not only those who have not but a demigod how can they unite against a more serious threat they cannot they can only die
1664420 tell me seer why do we desire to keep on living even if that life is empty and hopeless
1664421 i see a great wolf fur black as a soul fangs broken by bone and steel it is an old beast slashed by many winters challenged harried beaten it enters lifes twilight crossed with puffed scars this battle fought since the day of its birth is nearing its end it howled to the skies screaming injustice why it demanded to the powers beyond must it give up its life a life that still blazed hot within its fur the outcome preordained why must this struggle its greatest struggle be futile why it snarled could it not have a chance what powers great and terrible heard it then what powers light or dark granted its wish changed it made it into the demiurge that now stalks the land not even i know that my dear and it is better for me that way the deity is no longer that wolf in flesh but in heart that is a different story his hands crush tree trunks with the slightest squeeze his voice shatters ears brings knees to soil and summons a pack far mightier than ever he commanded as an alpha his skin cuts swords and a single swing of his axe hews the legs of giants in twain yet in his deepest heart where it pulses night after night is fear he became what he is to survive how long will that gift last who may come mighty enough to slay him every challenger no matter how slight is a deadly threat every battle no matter what the stakes is raw desperate strewn with gore and tainted with panic thus is he the fang and bloody claw of nature the primal savage urge to survive no matter what the cost no matter what the casualty and this urge infects us all today do you fear the night my dear perhaps you should fear him more as he fears you
1664422 tell me seer why does the moon wax and wane
1664423 i see cold mist plucking at skin and stabbing bone with chill i see eyes pits of gloom that draw in the horrified gaze he takes not a breath and his every gesture crackles like ancient bones snapping under an iron boot his claws have caressed eyes tongues and veins all with loving care he is a ghost that has never known life he passes through stone as if it were water flesh and soul as if they were a babys sigh he knows the true name of every being that is or ever will be and he hates them all is it the warmth of blood and breath that he despises so or does he believe that his bitter not life is perfection itself the mists that blanket our world are his eyes his fingers they probe they search they seek souls dying souls souls that are weak from age or youth corruption or na vet despair or hope in the dead of their dreams he finds them he tells them their true name and oh so gently holds them in his chill embrace child he whispers let me relieve all your burdens those who awaken are indelibly marked the lidded eyes the wandering mind the little jump at the innocent touch they remember naught but a shudder in their belly and an ill formed blot in their thoughts he visits again his icy hand sinking deeper drawing no blood only cries and sobs muffled as though smothered under a pillow each slumbereve he comes his words harsher his cut deeper until he tears at entrail and sinew sucks at marrow and plucks at the mouth tooth by tooth yet when his favored are found in their beds their bodies are whole their skin pure except for the horror stamped forever on their faces now my dear that you know how one can die do you really wish to know what comes after
1664424 but my first still remains how will this world end

1664572 he should be creepier than what he was in spider man 3
1664573 he should be creepier than he was in spider man 3 you dont want to scare the kids because the kids love the character but i think you could add a little bit of a creep factor i mean it never bugged me to watch frankenstein as a kid so you could have a little bit of it as long as you have a good story backing it up
1664574 im thinking about how they want to make anti heroes nowadays
1664575 those dont work the reason theyre so cool as a bad guy is because theyre bad and as soon as you try to give too much humanity to them then you go no now theyre not as good as a bad guy because youre trying to redeem them

1664577 the mother of the girl who has learning difficulties appealed the decision to the department of education claiming that it restricted her right to choose the school which her child should attend
1664578 my daughter has been in a mixed primary school all her life so half of her pals are boys who will be in nagle college anyway its crazy in this day and age that parents cant have a choice of schools in their own community because of gender

1664597 the incident didnt stop oil production on the caspian and exports from ceyhan are going in line with the schedule turkish state firm botas is taking all necessary measures to put the fire out
1664598 whether it is sabotage or some other reason we still dont have that information at this point all our efforts have been focused on putting out the fire completely

1664609 in my various declarations i have called for dialogue as a way out of the crisis while still reiterating that stand which government also endorses i appeal to our political leaders to begin implementing the maters plan which government has painstakingly worked out for the niger delta
1664610 the youths should join hands with government to carry out the projects contained in the master plan the kidnapping of people for ransom is contrary to the bible currently children are being stolen from the parents wives from their husbands husbands from their wives parents from children should stop
1664611 in specific terms the most potent threat facing nigeria is rather internal than external moreso that almost four decades after the nigerian civil war and for that matter eight years of uninterrupted democratic governance some of the problems which led to the civil war are very much with us
1664612 the antagonisms are still there and infact exacerbated by other internal threats ranging from corruption high poverty and unemployment levels political wrangling drug trafficking arms smuggling to armed robbery etc
1664613 as unfortunate and condemnable as it is the american intelligence report which talked of the possibility of nigeria becoming a failed stated in about fifteen years time was alluding to internal security threat situation rather than an external one
1664614 while still on the internal threats and challenges to nigerias security and democracy let me also add that the armed forces high command and indeed the defence policy recognizes the disruptive roles military coup detat and intervention have had on the countrys past attempts at democratic governance
1664615 the defence policy lays particular emphasis on military non involvement in politics constitutional control of the military and subordination to civil authority to achieve this the defence policy emphasises appropriate training programmes aimed at entrenching military professionalism democratic ethos and civil military relations for armed forces personnel
1664616 in the face of the serious security threat in nigeria a restructuring of some aspects of national life is absolutely necessary to this extent a country where armed robbers could rob the speaker attack the governors convoy where prominent citizens can be eliminated without the slightest chance of being caught surely deserves a structural review such review he said must cater for four perspectives namely security political social and economic
1664617 re structuring in the political sector must take into congnizance that political stability is the greatest weakness of nigeria in this regard the greatest culprits are electioneering process and perceived injustice to this extent the electoral process party politics and true federalism should be veritable tools for political stability and national growth these must be exploited for positive gains
1664618 in moving the nation and particularly the niger delta forward the derivation principle must be given more emphasis so as to improve on the socio economic development in the niger delta
1664619 i dont have my son why should those people have theirs
1664620 shes slowly forgetting him and thats the way its going to be by the time shes 10 shes going to forget all those hugs and kisses
1664621 we still believe the facts of this case do not merit the ultimate penalty of death
1664622 we feel confident on the issue of guilt and innocence
1664623 i simply had a terrible illness that i couldnt handle on my own
1664624 thats a sentence someone gets whos a predator not a voyeur
1664625 the behavior is being driven by a powerful biologically based craving
1664626 he is so driven its almost as though its tunnel vision
1664627 i know my sons heart and in my opinion hes not a criminal
1664628 they didnt call in advance they didnt go through the routine that most groups do
1664629 weve encouraged groups with special needs to come here for the past 37 years and we could not be more accommodating i feel sorry for the children because they could have had a good time
1664630 how would they feel if we were roped off in our own area the blind area
1664631 just because we cant see that doesnt mean we cant do what normal people can do because were normal
1664632 we always have had fun weve fallen like everyone it wasnt a problem
1664633 the overall majority of people buy these diplomas to use in the everyday working world
1664634 theres a lot of potential harm here from a homeland security standpoint of someone getting a chemical engineering degree or just someone doing damage in a company because theyre a dodo
1664635 kept his name on the superintendents list at almost every quarter
1664636 the fact that hes emeritus speaks to the fact that he was held and is held in an extremely high regard
1664637 my faculty members all left and it was too hard to set up a new committee
1664638 people dont always realize that we serve the german swiss and austrian embassies in washington
1664639 for the past 10 years the binkerts sausage platter has been a staple and a customer favorite and were out of sauerkraut too
1664640 the sausages were made traditionally and they were always very fresh they worked particularly well for what we are doing
1664641 binkerts impresses me because its a local family run business
1664642 the fire has to be bad for lothar he keeps the place so clean and is always tending the outside garden
1664643 the contents label of our sausages has maybe four items the label on most commercial sausage is so long with additives you cant read it
1664644 we smoke our meats with burning sawdust instead of using liquid smoke the way so many other places do
1664645 i get my meats from hatfield a slaughterhouse that buys from pennsylvania dutch farmers
1664646 we buy our meat deboned in 50 pound boxes if the animals are stressed when they are being transported the meat will be full of moisture and the sausages will turn out soggy we do not use that type of meat
1664647 i am not anti immigrant i am anti illegal immigrant
1664648 we hebben onze ambassade in peking ingeschakeld om diplomatieke stappen te nemen en hopen dat de chinezen op hun besluit terugkomen
1664649 criminals will no longer fear being executed in maryland no matter how heinous their crime
1664650 there is no question now about the innocence or guilt in this case
1664651 three separate baltimore city juries 12 members each men and women black and white have sentenced this man to death
1664652 consequently the defense never raised important facts like that hunt was high on pcp when the shooting occurred which might well have countered the prosecutors case that the murder was premeditated and thus death eligible
1664653 there will always be an error rate because this isnt a system thats run by infallible human beings and its impossible in the long run to run a system like this without making serious mistakes
1664654 de chinese equipe is extreem sterk en behoort in nagenoeg alle disciplines tot de kanshebbers op goud
1664655 het wordt waarschijnlijk een strijd tussen drie landen met china als favoriet gevolgd door rusland en ons
1664656 de kenners denken dat china de meeste gouden medailles gaat winnen ik doe geen voorspellingen of wij dan tweede of derde worden
1664657 we zijn getest toen we hier in peking aankwamen maar ook twee dagen daarvoor bij het trainingskamp in dalian het is belachelijk dat wij zo vaak aan de beurt zijn bovendien duurde het ook nog eens een uur en veertig minuten terwijl we maar met zn drie n waren
1664658 het is een zooitje ik wil niet te veel in details treden maar bernard heeft al drie keer een naald in hetzelfde bloedvat gehad natuurlijk moet er getest worden maar het gaat ons om de manier waarop en waarom moet het twee keer in twee dagen als het zo doorgaat verliezen we straks ons geduld
1664659 het is veel te vroeg om daar zo over te spreken
1664660 maar het is vreemd dat iemand dan direct van systematisch dopegebruik spreekt
1664661 officials waren al tijden op de hoogte van de testresultaten maar hebben tot vlak voor de olympische spelen gewacht om ze naar buiten te brengen het lijkt er gezien de timing op dat wordt geprobeerd een vervelende sfeer rond onze ploeg te cre ren toen in amerika het dopingnetwerk rond het balco lab werd ontdekt is de hele amerikaanse sportwereld toch ook niet in de beklaagdenbank gezet
1664662 sandro vai trabalhar mais um pouco antes da volta enquanto fumagalli ainda est em recupera o
1664663 ik vind het spijtig dat het cas niet de olympische spirit in overweging heeft genomen
1664664 de fifa is verrast en teleurgesteld in de uitspraak maar we respecteren deze wel
1664665 laat de voetballers deelnemen aan de olympische spelen het zou een teken van solidariteit en in perfecte harmonie met olympische spirit zijn

1664677 ive watched adrian since he was at oklahoma and to me hes an inspiration
1664678 hes a different type of back than i would say i am but when i watch him and i see him make moves and do things on that level i have no doubt that i can do that on this level
1664679 he had a big college career and me im coming off last years big performance if i did anything but something similar to what he did last year for me it will be a disappointment
1664680 no i am not a muslim but it would make no difference even if i were
1664681 hmm ok so he threw his volunteer outreach guy under the bus im convinced
1664682 if obama is muslim then i cannot vote for him because
1664683 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1664684 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change

1664797 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1664798 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1664799 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country

1664810 from obscurity my name and the three mystic dwarves became immortal
1664811 judges are expected to be guided by the rule of law and to resolve cases before them with judicial detachment
1664812 while indeed a second motion for reconsideration is a prohibited pleading under the 1997 rules of civil procedure we have allowed it in certain cases besides in administrative cases involving discipline of judges and court personnel we have allowed second or even third motions for reconsideration whenever justified by the circumstances
1664813 a philippine judge who claimed he could see into the future and admitted consulting imaginary mystic dwarfs has asked for his job back after being sacked by the countrys supreme court
1664814 they should not have dismissed me for what i believed
1664815 the supreme court said it was not within its expertise to conclude that floro was insane but agreed with the court clinics finding that he was psychotic
1664816 were not psychiatrists so we cant say hes gone stark staring loony tunes on us but we certainly agree with the doctors who said it
1664817 as in 1995 one fourth of present lawyers say that many or very many judges are corrupt although half or 49 percent say they know a case in their own city or province where a judge took a bribe only 8 percent said they reported the bribery the main excuse of those who kept silent is that they could not prove it
1664818 all truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times but to make them truly ours we must think them over again honestly till they take root in our personal experience

1664824 it shouldnt matter what i believe in whether its jesus muhammad or luis armand and angel
1664825 lest we be misconstrued we do not denigrate such a belief system
1664826 however such beliefs especially since judge floro acted on them are at odds with the critical and impartial thinking required of a judge under our judicial system
1664827 a series of unfortunate incidents have befallen the supreme court justices or their families including serious illnesses and car accidents
1664828 he has never consulted the elves when issuing judicial decisions
1664829 a couple of spirits some shadow people some black blobs one homunculus and a cat
1664830 it shouldnt matter what i believe in whether its jesus muhammad or luis armand and angel
1664831 there is no indication that judge floro is anything but an honorable man and in fact in our disposition of the 13 charges against him we have not found him guilty of gross misconduct or acts or corruption
1664832 the findings of psychosis by the mental health professionals assigned to his case indicate gross deficiency in competence and independence
1664833 he passed a mandatory psychiatric evaluation applied to all prospective judges and was sworn in as a regional trial court judge in november of that year handling both civil and criminal cases in malabon a district in greater manila
1664834 he is at present not intellectually and emotionally equipped to hurdle the responsibilities of a judge and he may decompensate when exposed to anxiety provoking and stress laden situation
1664835 it goes without saying that judge floros appointment as rtc judge is fait accompli what awaits us now is the seemingly overwhelming task of finding the proper just and equitable solution to judge floros almost seven years of suspension in the light of the fact that the penalty imposed herein does not merit a suspension of seven years

1664869 ive just learned about his illness lets hope its nothing trivial
1664870 he is not only dull himself he is the cause of dullness in others
1664871 he is simply a shiver looking for a spine to run up
1664872 they never open their mouths without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge
1664873 in order to avoid being called a flirt she always yielded easily
1664874 he loves nature in spite of what it did to him
1664875 why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on t
1664876 his mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork
1664877 some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go
1664878 he uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts for support rather than illumination
1664879 he has all of the morals of a dog in heat

1664996 what always gets me is the veterans on remembrance sunday in their wheelchairs shaking with old age and still making it to give respect to their old mates after having lived a compromised life for 80 years or so for some of them with the trauma of the memories and nightmares that dont go away now that is sacrifice

1665010 visiting the imperial commonwealth war grave cemetery in oosterbeek the netherlands and seeing the rows of headstones marking the graves of those who died in operation market garden during ww2 is a highly emotional experience and ones vision can get a bit watery at the thought of so many young lives wasted

1665038 i dont believe that expanding the library hours at other libraries would ever take the place of the core services in the main library
1665039 but i also understand we have to address a serious financial problem
1665040 i just really want us to take this slowly when we talk about closing a major important facility
1665041 not just the facility but the programs that go with it
1665042 i dont know im getting a little worried about who wrote this budget
1665043 my concern is that youll be increasing the contract services and eliminating and reducing city employee positions
1665044 there is no citywide park ranger program so i dont know what youre reducing
1665045 i havent seen a park ranger in years in my neck of the woods and so im not sure what that means
1665046 somehow even though weve asked every department to cut back theyll be given the manpower and the funding to absorb these kids into other programs
1665047 if youre going to add something or keep something you have to find the revenue for it
1665048 the police athletic league center being considered to be closed not only does that disturb me but it also pains me because i know what this organization has done for my life i can honestly say that if it was not for this organization i would not be standing in front of you right now with a very hopeful future i am a morehouse college freshman under the black managers association and i received a scholarship i am also a bill gates millennium scholarship winner i give an immense amount of credit to the pal organization because it guided me to make the right choices for my future take this program away and you will see an increase of police officers on the street i am asking the council to consider alternative decisions to the budget matter
1665049 i appreciate the fact that the city budget does need to be balanced but i feel it should not be done at the expense of citizens who live in the downtown district it would be wonderful to have my neighborhood library open seven days a week but it doesnt make sense to provide that service for my family and take away services desperately needed by other families individuals who depend on the main library as their own neighborhood library the other expense that has not been figured in is the loss of well qualified librarians and staff who would be let go if they build a new main library dedicated well educated people will be gone if main library was to close or be shuttered as mr west mentioned money and plans must be already in the pipeline to rebuild this necessary component
1665050 i look at the budget process schedule and to me the time frame is inverted you have labor negotiations first and then you have the budget meetings afterwards i dont understand how a city can depart from a city schedule so dramatically and start to have a balanced budget if it were me i would put the important matters for the taxpayers put that first and then put the money i had left to raises i think in this time of crisis you need to make some hard decisions on how you are willing to give services to the taxpayers and not necessarily everything to the employees you at least have them pay a fair share of their retirement costs that could possibly net you 30 million a year that could go a long way toward keeping the library open
1665051 we are thrilled to be going back to iraq and to have so many great blues artists volunteering to go to a war zone
1665052 this is certainly an historic event for the blues and for our men and woman who so proudly serve our country
1665053 my job is to take us deep into games and its extremely disappointing i am not able to do that

1665120 in a nutshell the increase in our population combined with a decline in our economy is putting pressure on our social assistance caseload and the associated costs
1665121 the economic indicators at this time are signaling trouble we are seeing an increase in our unemployment rate and that is the primary indicator of changes to the ontario works caseload
1665122 this is critical and we are going to have a heck of a hit in the next six to nine months if this continues
1665123 the economic indicators suggest that the situation is going to get much worse before it is going to improve we cant rely on our reserves to offset the costs and that will result in an impact on our tax base
1665124 we usually do an invocation and the pledge before we start so i dont know what happened im glad this young man reminded us thank you sir appreciate you
1665125 when will these idiot hecklers at obama townhalls realize that they are only doing him a favor after getting disrupted by hecklers last week for not focusing on black issues even though he has repeatedly the hecklers were at it again today too bad for this moron obama thoroughly owned his disruptive ass and gets a favorable headline in the process

1665130 a lot of what were going to do in the near future hinges on holder and his decision to come back to school or go pro
1665131 with the type of leadership he brings to the table id feel very confident about next season if he decides to come back
1665132 if we can stop this good year bad year jinx for one year i think we can stay off it for good
1665133 i do feel better about what we have coming back in 2009 than i did in 2007 and 2005 in terms of leadership we have good enough players to weather the storm
1665134 the key to our success in 2008 was that we had so many guys that played a part in our cws berth in 2006 you look at how the returnees at north carolina and oregon state kept the torch going and kept things at a high level thats our goal for 2009
1665135 from my standpoint from where we were in 2007 to where we ended the 2008 season it was pretty amazing in one sense in another sense it was disappointing considering how close we were to winning the title
1665136 the best remedy for this program is to start working and preparing for 2009
1665137 our drafted high school signees are expected to show up and i really dont think thats going to change between now and august 15
1665138 if that happens our talent definitely is good enough to win at a high level we just need to set the tone for the future
1665139 what we did in omaha this past season really helps us because it raises the accountability for the returning players
1665140 for us to put back to back good years together the players must come back with some pride and a sense of tradition
1665141 miraba le mirobelle schnaps joan miro has always been on my list of favorite artists and while there are many on that list there is a special place for miro and it is the sort of a far away cool detached yet grooviness of the painting that spoke to me i hope i was able to depart that in my piece
1665142 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1665143 as oysters take around three years to mature there could well be a boost for uk trade
1665144 we had a warm winter followed by a rainy spring which caused high levels of planktonic plant life to develop
1665145 this meant that the oysters were particularly well fed and spent a lot of energy developing their sexual organs to the detriment of their natural reserves leaving them vulnerable to oshv 1
1665146 the government and the energy companies have decided that replacing kingsnorth will be a symbol that britain is able to use a form of energy generation that produces massive amounts of harmful co2
1665147 but we determined that our protest will also be a symbol
1665148 if we can stop this power station being built then we will make it much harder for the authorities to defy public pressure and build other coal fired stations in the future
1665149 when the time is right they will move together streaming into the power station to shut it down
1665150 if the law protects the right of industries to destroy the planet then it is up to people like us to prevent that even if it means breaking the law
1665151 while we completely respect the protesters right to campaign peacefully what is not acceptable are their plans to invade the power station
1665152 power stations are not adventure playgrounds and if anyone does get in they will be putting their safety and the safety of our workers at risk
1665153 what we have found is a bunch of intelligent and articulate people who have set a real example to us
1665154 all that means is that more coal will be burned and the pollution will remain
1665155 no one actually knows how much coal we will need to burn when the new power station is built that depends on market conditions
1665156 we are about pushing for radical social change about the whole way the economy works
1665157 i was so close to quitting all i wanted to do was stop
1665158 it is by far the toughest thing ive ever done
1665159 when i woke i felt like i had been asleep for hours
1665160 theres a lot of people on our team who arent happy with our class choices
1665161 but after weve established diablo iii as its own game with its own type of gameplay and experiences i wouldnt be opposed to looking at old classes we are trying to design the witch doctor class so that if we did bring back the necromancer theres room for him were looking out ahead of time at what our expansions are going to be so weve got to keep room open for some of those other classes down the road
1665162 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1665165 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1665180 we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanical aids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn
1665181 i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life
1665182 i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one it is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route and make a beaten track for ourselves
1665183 john mccain wants to talk about paris hilton and britney spears
1665184 thats his idea of a really relevant campaign but i dont have time to deal with all that mess because americans are facing some serious challenges
1665185 hes got karl roves assistants working for him its going to be the same kind of nasty campaign the public is going to hear all kinds of exaggerations and distortions
1665186 barack obama does have the ability to stir up hope and excitement and enthusiasm and they know that so theyre going to try to take that strength and somehow turn it into some kind of negative
1665187 there is nothing wrong with pointing out that barack obama opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
1665188 if barack obama wants to have a serious debate he can start by offering some solutions to challenges facing ohio families
1665189 pursuing the idea that obama is not like you that he is an elite hollywood celebrity not a salt of the earth regular guy
1665190 they are trying to create an image of him that in particular will repel a portion of voters whose loyalties might be in doubt and theyre doing it in a very clever way
1665191 its not the same as swift boating but its the same concept to make this guy appear alien and unacceptable and not american
1665192 if you want to recite the pledge of allegiance go ahead
1665193 mccains already started the negative stuff hes got karl roves assistants working for him
1665194 jack absolutely nothing we had the tests running two went fine and then nothing weve used the same levels of power for the particle scanner the machine is not doing anything
1665195 so unless we work out why its not working we cant convert him back
1665196 theres a chance that were not getting it back together again
1665197 its not your fault so we dont know why or how its broken and to find out we have to risk breaking it permanently
1665198 which means iantos at risk of being stuck but if we dont open it up and carry on being tentative hes at risk of being stuck anyway
1665199 so we are looking at this possibly being months years
1665200 okay well have to risk it open it up and have a look
1665201 we cant keep looking after him like this not if its going to be months
1665202 nothing permanent just perhaps we should look into fostering or something
1665203 he might look three gwen but hes still got all his adult memories we may still need to keep an eye on him
1665204 i dont mean sever all contacts but you know from day to day perhaps hell be safer
1665205 weve already had that incident with the laxus mandrake if something else happens we cant just keep dumping him on rhys
1665206 hes perfectly safe in the hub if we ever have to go out then one of us stays behind well think of something
1665207 im not letting him go we cant take that risk the entirety of torchwoods secure information is locked away in that three year old brain he could still let secrets out even if he doesnt understand them
1665208 we are not farming him out to strangers and we are certainly not taking his memory off him ill look after him for as long as i have to
1665209 es war vor cameron h chstpers nlich die einzige option war also sich zu betrinken ich habe wahrscheinlich undeutlich gesprochen ich kann mich nicht erinnern
1665210 hey amerika ich bin paris hilton und auch ich bin eine ber hmtheit nur stamme ich weder aus alten zeiten noch verspreche ich wandel wie der andere typ ich bin einfach hei
1665211 ich vermute das hei t ich kandidiere f r das pr sidentenamt
1665212 ich m chte dass amerika wei dass ich absolut bereit bin das kommando zu bernehmen

1665214 kalau persoalan coverage di jalan raya pelanggan tidak perlu kuatir tetapi di sejumlah gedung memang sering terjadi lemah sinyal atau drop call
1665215 dari 600 gedung bertingkat yang ada di jakarta 60 persen di antaranya memiliki sinyal telkom flexi yang kuat sedangkan 40 sisanya belum ada kesepakatan antara pengelola dan pihak kami untuk membangun jaringan di sana
1665216 padahal membangun di salah satu lantai saja sudah cukup untuk melayani pelanggan flexi di gedung tersebut akibatnya masalah ini bermuara lagi di besarnya pengeluaran yang harus dianggarkan
1665217 belum apa apa mereka menawarkan tarif sewa sekira rp2 milyar per gedung itu jumlah yang besar seharusnya perlu diadakan diskusi lagi untuk tarif sewa tersebut
1665218 last time i was here was when i played for lausanne we won 2 1 and id be happy if we can repeat that
1665219 were really looking forward to this its a great stadium a tough opponent and a huge crowd well stick to what we usually do as we believe in ourselves
1665220 if you looked at our game last week it was an even contest which i think we slightly edged
1665221 i think we might have to rely more on counterattacks tonight but thats no problem
1665222 its what you strive for and ive got a good feeling about this a really good feeling
1665223 i think we were the better side last week but tonight is a different matter
1665224 we have to be smart and see what they try to do of course it would be great if we could score early on and if we play at our normal level i know we can
1665225 dnipro have big ambitions a strong squad and the finances to match
1665226 vujadinovi is the right player to complete our defensive line given the various competitions the squad will be in this season
1665227 i know steaua are romanias biggest club and all i can say is that i will do my best and prove that i am a 100 per cent professional player
1665228 how did my early experiences contribute towards me becoming myself
1665229 i did not have any doubts that we could beat rangers
1665230 if we met rangers again i would still say they were favourites
1665231 but we worked very hard in recent weeks and deserved this win
1665232 i will fly to denmark on saturday and will watch aalborg in the danish league
1665233 many people think that we will have an easier task in the third round but i dont think so as aalborg are in better form than rangers at the moment
1665234 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1665235 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1665236 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1665237 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1665238 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1665239 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist

1665249 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1665250 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1665251 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1665252 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1665253 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1665254 the most beneficial field ive seen in my professional lifetime
1665255 the relative stability of the race even in the aftermath of such a high visibility event as obamas foreign trip coupled of course with the mccain campaigns efforts to limit its impact continues to suggest that it may be the conventions in late august and early september that will offer the next potential time frame for significant and or sustained change

1665326 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1665327 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections

1665331 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1665332 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1666028 you get to know people this way and we can tell the criminals that they dont belong here
1666029 weve seen a lot but its better a lot better and its because of the neighbors
1666030 we know a lot of people who live on our block and the ones surrounding it
1666031 but were meeting people who live further away and were making an effort to do so because its important
1666032 we probably had about 200 people here a lot more kids too for some reason but that just made it even more fun
1666033 when we moved to tacoma we first lived in the hilltop

1666044 there are two things that you would need to get a signal to other planets firstly it has to be able to leave our planet secondly it would have to have as much power as possible
1666045 as you go into space that power would dissipate they would need more and more sensitive equipment to pick it up
1666046 detecting a signal like this with lots of background noise would be incredibly hard but what they would look for is a pattern in the signals to show that they were not naturally occurring
1666047 some of our radars are easily detectable quite far hundreds of light years into space if the aliens wish to try and if theyre in the beam
1666048 of course no one more than about 50 70 light years away will have yet heard from us but i figure that our earliest broadcasts are washing over about one new star system each day so the potential audience is growing
1666049 if democracy means anything local elected officials speak for the people of the community and local elected officials in granville county now oppose bringing the facility to butner

1666055 not one republican voted for the bill which also says the day shall have special significance in public school and other educational institutions and encourages those entities to conduct suitable commemorative exercises on that date sen dave cox r fair oaks said his vote against the measure had nothing to do with who was involved in school we ought to concentrate on writing reading and arithmetic he said adding that the schools dont need other requirements placed on them by the legislature the bill must return to the assembly for concurrence on some minor amendments before it goes to the governor
1666056 both houses of our legislature have now honored harvey milks important civil rights legacy and i am hopeful the governor will sign this bill so that california officially recognizes the message of hope and pride his life inspired

1666064 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
1666065 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
1666066 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
1666067 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
1666068 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
1666069 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency

1666083 they are by their very nature an intense struggle for power
1666084 the answer to the problem is not to invade and occupy countries which we did in iraq and afghanistan
1666085 but relying on other instruments of power to try to prevent islamic radicalism from increasing its reach and its influence in the world
1666086 i was right on iraq obama was wrong on iraq vote for me and i will be more effective in dealing with the global war on terror
1666087 no iraq has never been the central front in the global war on terror afghanistan is and i am the one who has understood this from the beginning elect me president and i will shift our effort toward afghanistan and i will be the one who will wage the war on global terror more effectively

1666103 judeo christian ethic then those certain parts of you are not equal
1666104 thanks for the nice mention of original yogatoes in your blog
1666105 if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet
1666106 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1666107 but whos really out of touch the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1666108 obama is wrong inflated tires are no substitute for oil drilling and a comprehensive energy plan
1666109 john mccain says barack would rather lose the war to win an election he just said something like that despite the fact that if we had followed my recommendation not to go into the war in iraq we would have about an extra trillion dollars to rebuild our economy we would have been on the path of energy independence we would have finished the job in afghanistan and gone after qaeda
1666110 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1666111 rnc urged him to call congress back into session to vote on an energy bill
1666112 obama is wrong inflated tires are no substitute for oil drilling and a comprehensive energy plan
1666113 i saw that sen obamas latest attack is got to do with oil and campaign contributions
1666114 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1666115 while sen mccains plan wont save you at the pump any time soon i have to say this it sure has raised him a lot of campaign dollars
1666116 sen mccain raised more than 1 million from the oil industry just last month most of it came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a room full of oil executives
1666117 i noticed that theres confusing now information from senator obama as to whether he actually supports offshore drilling or not
1666118 the fact is we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately and it has to be done as quickly as possible and i believe that its vital that we move forward with that regardless of what we do on other energy issues
1666119 keep calling them back until they act on behalf of the interests of the american people in this compelling national security issue and its time we got serious about energy independence
1666120 i knew it was safe then and i know its safe now
1666121 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1666122 keep calling them back until they act on behalf of the interests of the american people in this compelling national security issue and its time we got serious about energy independence
1666123 as for the photos of bush himself the prologue proves beyond all reasonable doubt that throughout the sea of blood and the screams and cries of men women and children even babies coming out of the hell on earth he created in iraq unbelievably he laughed and joked had fun and enjoyed every day of his presidency i mean he told us this im going to have a perfect day he said laura and i had a fabulous year and were having the time of our life bush in addition to his transcendent criminality has added a snapshot view of extreme grossness and vulgarian audacity to this otherwise sacred selection of photos

1666151 and guess who pays the homeowners the workers the local businesses and the american taxpayer
1666152 as the legal representative of united states taxpayers who are the largest creditors in this multibillion dollar case the justice department has an obligation to help ensure whichever entity assumes control of asarcos asset will also be obligated to remediate the multistate toxic legacy of asarcos destructive environmental practices

1666156 more comparable with the predictability of when we believe our revenue growth will accelerate back toward our long term guidance
1666157 the combined effects of increased oil and gas production and higher oil natural gas and natural gas liquids prices led to the increase in sales
1666158 weve had high oil prices for several years and in spite of that weve not seen a supply increase thats been able to build a production cushion

1666163 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1666164 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1666165 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds

1666201 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1666202 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1666203 it is obviously a potentially difficult time when any diagnosis of prostate cancer is made

1666216 its important to never stop learning and i always try to keep a beginners mind i set goals for the long term and the short term technical mental physical and even spiritual and then try to reach them and then i try to go far beyond them theyre all related to the overall development as a person as well as a fighter having the team of coaches that i do is extremely important to that development because they have the abilities to push me as well as the knowledge to make me better ill only stop learning and stop improving when im dead
1666217 all of these commitments have forced me to be more specific with my training its given me an intense focus and makes me manage my time that much better

1666220 its very weird for me because i never thought id be that guy that anyone would look up to
1666221 i do this because i love it i didnt expect to become however small it is a celebrity im blessed to be in a situation where people know my name and i love to take advantage of it the best that i can for any kid who sees me as a role model it feels good its more rewarding than training or having a belt

1666352 this is due to modest economic growth shrinking populations notably in germany italy and spain and the gradual substitution of fuel oil and heating oil in favour of natural gas and renewable energy sources
1666353 however the demand for diesel is still high due to energy problems in the country as the oil price comes down the price of petrol should moderate helping with inflation and the trade balance
1666354 fortunately in the past two months many of these emerging markets have been reducing their subsidies due to the high cost should this trend continue it may lead to some moderation in demand for oil from the emerging markets
1666355 the correction in the oil price is long overdue as demand is taking a knock which is positive news for motorists

1666423 given no choice she signed the credit card and paid 2600 in total

1666522 i really like the way mcgeady plays football he is a natural talent who can create a brilliant piece of play in the blink of an eye
1666523 eleven football players of celtic football club did more in 90 minutes at hampden park on saturday for the good of football than officialdom in whose hands the destiny of the game lies has done in years and years for with a display of such grandeur as has rarely graced the great vast ground they proved conclusively the value of concentration on discipline and on the arts and crafts of the game to the exclusion of the so called power play which has been a disfiguring weakness in the sport but which has frequently been accredited through the awarding of international honours to the strong men
1666524 not since their brilliant coronation cup days at hampden have celtic played football of such quality
1666525 valentine a forlorn bewitched figure repeatedly beaten in the air and on the ground in a variety of ways and the disintegration of rangers defence undoubtedly stemmed from mcphails mastery
1666526 mochans pace and penetrative dribbling had shearer in a dreadful dither almost from the first kick of the ball
1666527 in the first 20 minutes celtic might have scored at least four goals
1666528 soon fernie was travelling half the length of the field again and running his opponents into the ground
1666529 fallon again reduced the ill supported scott to a hapless young man
1666530 never have i seen rangers so outclassed in half back play fernie evans and peacock were each in his own distinguished way tremendous players in everything but brawn and bulk no one celt however did not but contribute handsomely to the teams glorious day
1666531 perhaps only fernie of all footballers in scotland could have emulated tullys first half feat of ball manipulation which enabled him to outwit baird davis valentine and caldow then as his team mates poised themselves for the chip back from the goal line tully struck like lightning and the ball cannoned off the very edge of the near post passed between niven and the goal line and out of play beyond the post the goal of a century had been within half an inch of achievement
1666532 what we have had in the past is people very much relying on their houses for their pensions despite the fact that only ten per cent of people have houses with enough value to provide a decent amount of income through things like equity release and downsizing people are aware of this i think its a major issue for a lot of people

1666611 emily and i are frustrated sometimes with any kind of box
1666612 because we want to experiment musically and we do a lot of electric stuff but the reality is that we are a folk band
1666613 at some point i was hanging around with the butchies a band i ended up playing with a lot and it just brought out this thing in me and it felt very different from the indigo girls
1666614 something like bus bus i wanted this lead thing going on with a kind of raucous band and the harmonies are very important but they are more of a bed that youre singing over rather than the duo
1666615 i think the musicians i play with solo do a certain thing that the musicians we play with with the indigo girls dont do its just a different thing and it sort of steers my writing in some ways
1666616 radio radio slc fighting the good fight for me boys and girls lend a hand bend an ear in gods land

1666618 for indie labels it was a big adjustment because we ended up with a lot of cds on hand when downloading happened we knew it was coming it came but it happened a little bit faster than we thought

1666620 the internet has revolutionized the diy movement and its great to me i dont even know if record labels need to exist i dont even know if i need to exist
1666621 its like youre doing all this stuff the traveling and the unpacking and the packing just to play the show and in that one moment during the show thats the fun thats where all the fun is
1666622 you get to see different places get to go running in a different town every day its very stimulating and that can be a very good thing
1666623 broadband is an essential resource in todays world and economy this new law is a resounding victory for the residents students and businesses in communities that have gone without it for too long
1666624 expanding access to broadband will create substantial opportunities for economic academic and cultural growth
1666625 high costs pose a significant entry barrier for the private sector and are a root cause of the broadband inequities were experiencing now
1666626 strategic investment by the state will bring private companies to the table and ignite the competition that will make broadband accessible and affordable throughout the commonwealth
1666627 going forward the institute will tailor a public private model to close the states most acute broadband gaps in western massachusetts and to meet the needs of other regions
1666628 a regional long term approach will enable every community to be active participants in and beneficiaries of our 21 st century knowledge based economy
1666629 as someone who has worked on this issue for many years i can say without reservation that the governors leadership has had a profound effect on crystallizing this issue in the public and the legislature
1666630 this is a significant step toward high speed internet access for all of the citizens of western massachusetts access that will be critical to the future economic development education and communications in these underserved communities
1666631 for far too long residents of the communities i represent have been blocked from the on ramp to the information superhighway
1666632 today we see true progress backed by a 40 million state investment to bring broadband to western massachusetts it has been a pleasure working with my colleagues in the delegation and the patrick administration to secure swift passage of this legislation and i look forward to continuing our collaborations to achieve of our collective goal universal broadband access in all of massachusetts
1666633 with the signing of this legislation a world of business educational and cultural opportunities will open up for thousands of people all across the commonwealth
1666634 this is a remarkable step forward for the entire state
1666635 without question broadband availability enhances the overall quality of life in any given community especially towns like those in my district
1666636 with this legislation this region will finally have access to those opportunities and the return on this state investment will be significant in terms of jobs education and regional economic development
1666637 this program will make our bridges safer at a time of critical need create thousands of jobs and provide long term economic benefits along the way
1666638 by investing today we will complete more bridge projects in less time and at a lower cost
1666639 it was imperative that we took this immediate action to better maintain our infrastructure for the safety and security of all who travel our roads and bridges
1666640 this new law brings the added boost of a shot in the arm to our workforce through the creation of new construction jobs and a much need stimulus to our entire economy
1666641 the state has gone too long without basic maintenance and preventative work on its bridges and i applaud governor patricks attention to what has become a serious public safety concern
1666642 our bridges are essential to the daily operations of commerce and travel by taking action now we can begin immediately to make up for decades of neglect and avoid higher costs in the future
1666643 the accelerated bridge repair program is a top priority of the executive office of transportation
1666644 we will have accountable and transparent management of this program and are ready to move forward expeditiously
1666645 the bridge collapse in minnesota was a wake up call to the nation and a tragic reminder of the importance of investing in our infrastructure
1666646 years of neglect and inadequate investment in the states capital assets and infrastructure have resulted in a backlog that has far exceeded available resources committing 3 billion to fund more than 250 structurally deficient bridge rehabilitation and prevention projects over the next eight years creates thousands of jobs improves the safety and condition of our bridge inventory and generates significant savings for the commonwealth
1666647 the accelerated bridge program will provide multiple benefits which include substantial improvements to our states bridge infrastructure while at the same time providing an economic stimulus to the state
1666648 i am very proud to be here to celebrate this bill that takes us one very important step closer to providing every child in massachusetts with the lifelong benefits of strong educational beginnings

1667056 qlikview bridges the gap among all of these tools in a single solution eliminating the tradeoff between power and simplicity it delivers the depth of an olap cube that is as easy to work with as a pdf report
1667057 this combination of power and simplicity in a single solution makes the conventional top down approach to bi obsolete

1667081 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1667082 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1667083 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1667084 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1667085 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1667086 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1667087 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1667088 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1667089 our balance sheet remains strong and we are extremely well positioned in the current environment
1667090 the report gives up an indication on both supply and demand and a lot of the selloff in the past couple of weeks is on expectation that we will see inventories rebuild and a sluggish demand pattern continue
1667091 a month or two ago when the market was in its bull mode the market would have rallied sharply on this
1667092 we just had a tropical storm which was going right up the gut of the gas natural gas production and the market barely shrugged

1667105 this year we saw all the same companies return to exhibit at maats and more the slight attendance decrease can be attributed to the fact that returning companies brought less people to the show
1667106 in fact we had a larger number of buyers attend this years show than last year the 400 total buyers doesnt take into account the buyer cross over we saw from icast which doesnt record those numbers
1667107 the feedback we received from maats exhibitors regarding the shared show floor was overwhelmingly positive
1667108 exhibitors and buyers alike felt the shared space created an increased buzz for both shows and provided each venues participants with new business opportunities
1667109 this large dealer turnout signals great potential for the shows future
1667110 were planning to roll out a full marketing plan to attract even more dealers to maats in 2009

1667135 that cannot appear because if it succeeds then everybody is united against the victim who appears to be genuinely guilty if it fails if there is no unanimity there is simply no phenomenon to watch in order for the phenomenon to be observable there must be a group of very lucid observers small enough not to threaten the unanimity of the persecutors its the case in christs passion all participation in the scapegoat phenomenon is the same sin of the persecution of christ and all human beings commit this sin
1667136 could reach a form of radical awareness of the violence nature of human beings
1667137 eventually relapsed into a patriarchal caste system of hindu brahmanical heritage which represents a form of exclusion of symbolic and actual outcasting
1667138 not fully aware of the scapegoat mechanism they know what sacrifice is and they progressively try to forbid it the difference i see between them and christianity is that the latter was able to formulate in the gospels and unmask in a full light the anthropological mechanism of mimetic scapegoating and sacrifice
1667139 we have to invent some ritual of atonement that is to say a new religion the text is speaking about the birth of religion as well as its death because they amount to the same thing
1667140 an illusory and idolatrous form of sacred that nonetheless can protect the archaic human community from greater and more disruptive forms of violence
1667141 always use jacques maritains formula with the passing of time there is always more good and more evil in the world
1667142 desire is always mimetic some human beings resist desire and being carried away by mimetic violence when jesus says scandals must happen matthew 18 he is talking about communities to talk about freedom means to talk about mans ability to resist the mimetic mechanism
1667143 we are free because we can truly convert ourselves at any time in other words we can refuse to join the mimetic unanimity c onversion means to become aware that we are persecutors it means choosing christ or a christlike individual as a model for our desires
1667144 skandalon becomes the inability to walk away from mimetic rivalry an inability that turns rivalry into an addiction servitude because we kneel in front of those who are important for us without seeing what is at stake the proliferation of scandals meaning of mimetic rivalry is what produces disorder and instability in society but this instability is put to an end by the scapegoat resolution which produces order satan or stan as i like to type it casts out satan meaning that the scapegoat mechanism produces a false transcendence that stabilizes society through a satanic principle and the order cannot but be only temporary and it is bound to revert sooner or later into the disorder of scandals
1667145 in order to free oneself from sacrifice someone has to set the example and renounce all mimetic retaliations to learn about the role of mimetism in human violence helps to understand why jesus teachings in the sermon on the mount are what they are they are not masochistic they are not excessive they are simply realistic taking into account our almost irresistible tendency to retaliate the bible conceives the history of the elected people as constant relapsing into mimetic violence and its sacrificial consequences
1667146 the fundamental human situation there is no doubt that the distance between these two actions is the greatest possible and it is the difference between the archaic sacrifice which turns against a third victim the violence of those who are fighting and the christian sacrifice which is the renunciation of all egoistic claiming even to life if needed in order not to kill

1667150 its a concern for all of us specifically in pop warner but in youth sports in general all those funds are contributed by the families of the kids involved or by local businesses if the funds were embezzled and did not get to the benefit of the children in the program thats a concern in itself

1667211 trans yamuna is one of the most fire prone region of the city and any anti fire operation becomes difficult there due to congested roads and heavy traffic

1667238 other studies also demonstrated that dogs follow human pointing more likely to tell humans the location of hidden objects when they didnt see the object being hidden and tend to steal food when the humans are looking away or closing their eyes

1667240 another possibility is that contagious yawning and possibly empathy could be a more widespread characteristics among mammals
1667241 it is possible that such contagion coordinate the mood status between the dogs and humans

1667320 his opinion is his opinion im not going to voice my opinion about anything fernando has done or said
1667321 all i will say is you cant see any strings leading to heikkis kovalainen shoulders or you cant see anyones hands up his back
1667322 hes an honest guy and i think he will more than convince anyone who talks to him this is a team absolutely committed to equality it always has been and it always will be
1667323 people will point to the last gp in germany and say it was obvious there were team orders in that event because it was clear heikki moved over and let lewis pass
1667324 but the simple fact was throughout the race lewis was nearly seven tenths of a second faster and heikki was told that he was not told to let lewis pass
1667325 but when youre in a team and you know your team mate has the opportunity to win the race and you dont if you have the right values that are not lodged solely and exclusively in your own motives and your own objectives and your own selfishness then you take a decision which is to allow the driver past and allow him a chance to win the race which is what he did
1667326 you can go back through the entire history of mclaren and talk to any driver whos driven for us and you will not find anyone save for one who will not verify this team always runs on the basis of equality and always will

1667375 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1667376 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1667377 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1667378 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district

1667433 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1667434 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1667435 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1667436 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1667437 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the

1667456 while 10 of her colleagues have come together to forge a commonsense compromise elizabeth dole is nowhere to be found more interested in scoring political points than solving problems while the bill is not perfect i have learned during my time in the senate that compromise and consensus are necessary if we are to get anything done doing nothing or political posturing and grandstanding are not an option when working families are paying 4 per gallon for gas
1667457 we need to end the bush dole big oil approach to energy policy that created our dependence on foreign oil this plan is balanced and provides a number of comprehensive approaches that lower energy costs and reduce dependence on foreign oil

1667459 weve got to send people in washington to make the hard decisions we have got to do things in a different way

1667495 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1667496 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1667497 kita kaget karena selama ini dia sering dihujat kok malah menghujat dirinya sendiri dan terbawa bawa juga nama organisasi
1667498 ive been talking about electronic medical records during my whole campaign
1667499 i think that we need to have changes to the health care system
1667500 each one of us needs to have electronic medical records
1667501 when we go to a hospital or community health center we ought to be able to access our own medical records so that a physician knows what sort of drugs were taking and what are the latest x rays and cat scans weve had so we dont have to do the same test over and over again
1667502 will just about fell over dead when he saw her
1667503 we got out of the car and he said to me come on over its kay hagan
1667504 we support kay because shell get higher pay for teachers and want a greater focus on education from the federal level
1667505 weve had a democratic senator in the past in north carolina and wed love to send another democratic senator to washington in the tradition of john edwards
1667506 i want people to see me face to face and know i care about eastern north carolina
1667507 we need to safely and responsibly end this war in iraq
1667508 i want to give miss liddy dole that pair of ruby red slippers
1667509 i think people are sick and tired of politicians like elizabeth dole who are spending too much time taking care of lobbyists and their special interests
1667510 i know a lot of good things take place for veterans
1667511 but when you see whats happened at walter reed military medical center when you see some of the issues that we found out about at fort bragg you just want to be sure that the men and women coming back from serving our country come back to good clean facilities and obviously have good treatment
1667512 but i certainly want to hear your concerns and promise to always respond to you afterward
1667513 of the two u s senators one has done very well getting back to us when we have problems
1667514 the other one i think shes a female but i dont know because ive never seen or heard her but thats what i think we need here we need someone who will be fair and equitable to everyone that they represent
1667515 were very confident especially as were getting deeper into this campaign season
1667516 the seat i am running for is the late senator jesse helms senator no seat
1667517 i cant believe dole has voted twice not to review that legislation
1667518 kay hagan was in a comfortable place she would have been re elected she was up there with the big boys chairing committees but for us the democratic party she agreed to run
1667519 i am going up there to vote the way kay hagan thinks is right
1667520 i have been so bored sometimes i would do anything to get it over with
1667521 it was after multiple sex acts during the course of the night
1667522 some women just dont know what to do or how to move their body for example riding doesnt just mean going up and down its about hitting different angles because each angle feels different not to mention its boring in just one spot continuously
1667523 the p ssy itself isnt bad its the woman attached to it bad p s y is a woman who doesnt know how to work her hips ride d ck properly evidently this is very important and runs from the d ck during back shots if she doesnt have rhythm then its difficult for us to work together
1667524 some girls just dont know how to position themselves in the doggystyle position your back cannot and should not be rounded the arch should be concave from the point of view of the guy not convex
1667525 i had a girlfriend once who was utterly silent throughout the entire experience it was awful a man wants to look at a woman and know hes pleasing her we also want to hear from her that were doing a good job any absence of feedback is pretty bad
1667526 some girls dont know how to relax its like they want to have sex but still performing like its there first time when a guy is on top of you why not wrap ur legs around him why just lay there
1667527 women who call me daddy and say other cliche corny sh t fall into said category
1667528 bad p ssy is subjective but for me its clampussy super dry and excuse the 40 year old virgin ref sandbag like
1667529 p ssy can be bad if there are no juices and berries basically if its just dry you can start fires like that especially with all the friction and pubic hairs
1667530 p ssy can be bad if there is not an emotional connection sex and orgasm may happen but after you either feel empty inside or like you just raped someone
1667531 uh she wasnt fresh down there so it ruined the moment
1667532 bad p is like bad pizza its still pretty fn good
1667533 some guys may say that bad p s y is not wet and all that stuff but i think that has more to do with the girl not relaxing and letting her self go
1667534 el presidente culmin una etapa 66 leyes muy importantes revolucionarias nosotros continuaremos el resto de las materias
1667535 careful stewardship of the economy has positioned us well to weather the current economic storm

1667538 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1667539 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1667540 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1667541 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1667542 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1667606 its three easy steps works in the shower use it when your skin is wet rinse it off with no soap hop out pat dry and youre tan
1667607 its not like a foundation that disappears and washes off entirely it penetrates the skin to a certain degree on the surface and the color does gradually develop
1667608 rinse off all other product before you put the product on that way you are clean water wet
1667609 i like that its fast and you can control how tan you get but i dont like how you have to wear the rubber gloves in the shower cause they get full of water and its very messy
1667610 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1667611 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1667612 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations

1667619 these were two hard losses games we had a chance to win
1667620 you cant panic but you have to take it with a sense of urgency
1667621 we havent held opponents below five runs in many of those games we havent come up with big hits its a combination of a lot of different things
1667622 their offense is one of the best around they take their swings and they take their walks
1667623 i was a little nervous because it was the yankees and i never faced a team of that caliber before

1667643 a comprehensive vaccination programme against cervical cancer has been long demanded and was finally conceded by government afgter much pressure this form of cancer kills some 70 women in the 26 counties every year
1667644 the ministers announcement of the roll out of a vaccination programme for 12 year olds from 2009 is welcome but her decision no to proceed with the catch up programme for 13 to 15 year olds is atrocious
1667645 while appreciating the fact that the minister established a review to look at how the trust areas were managed this is a very stark indication that time is of the essence people are dying

1667657 the minor ailment scheme has run since 2005 and involves pharmacists dispensing medication for ailments such as colds or flus
1667658 over 200 000 people avail of the scheme in 518 pharmacies across the north but it is in danger of collapsing unless there is agreement between the pcc and department of health
1667659 it is estimated that the current system saves the department around 8 million per year but if the pcc remove themselves from the scheme then extra cost will be incurred by the department as people will have to go to their doctors for appointments and prescriptions

1667663 recently published figures show record numbers of heroin addicts seeking treatment the figure has doubled to 10 000 in the past ten years however the current cocaine epidemic has overshadowed the heroin crisis in recent years
1667664 while the cocaine epidemic must remain a top priority for the garda it is essential that the fight against heroin is not de prioritised heroin dealers must remain a top target for garda drug squads

1667666 ninety percent of over 6 trillion business e mails this year will be spam this volume puts it resources under an incredible strain to manage not only the spam but the ensuing backscatter just recently an isp was driven offline while trying to absorb 10 000 backscatter messages per second
1667667 the impact of backscatter is especially hard on businesses with fewer it resources or appliances that just cant scale to meet the processing load with network security in the cloud companies of all sizes can enjoy a scalable enterprise class security solution that is easy to manage and provides better protection and value than traditional appliances and software

1667669 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1667670 even though typical transaction sizes will remain in the 3 5 bracket a sufficient number of users will be using their mobiles to buy music games tickets infotainment and the other digital goods sufficiently often to see gross transaction value grow nearly seven fold by 2013

1667679 this fine selection of some of the best short fiction by one of the most respected dark fantasy writers in the world will be a must purchase for aficionados of the genre shepard is fantasy literatures joseph conrad or perhaps its saul bellow a writer who never tires of staring directly into the abyss
1667680 shepard writes the richest prose in all of dark fantasy the longish short story and the novella are his fortes and it isnt too extreme to say he ranks with hawthorne in depth of concentration perception and moral resonance quite often shepard seems to be writing fantasy only because he conceives of magic supernatural or existential arising out of extreme violence and terror always however he is writing better than nearly anyone else in anglophone america today

1667699 as i spoke with local historians read through county journals searched through newspaper archives and read through county books and interview transcriptions for this project i truly began to enjoy history

1667701 thousands of hours have been expended over the past year to uncover that no laws were broken and that politicians will always attempt to undermine their political enemies
1667702 it is my hope that with the release of these documents today every reporter pundit and citizen can review the material come to their own conclusions and finally allow new york state to move on and deal with the critical issues facing our communities throughout the county state and country
1667703 heavy snowfall last winter took some fawns in parts of northern and northeastern utah
1667704 we manage the states general season units so theres between 15 to 20 bucks per 100 does in the herds
1667705 almost all of the states units are meeting that goal
1667706 after last falls hunts two of the states public land units were above 20 bucks per 100 does and three of the units were below 15 bucks per 100 does all of the remaining public land units had 15 to 20 bucks per 100 does in their herds
1667707 the guys that are successful year in and year out do their homework
1667708 they get out and find the places where the bucks are
1667709 during the archery hunt the deer are usually still in their summer patterns doing some preseason scouting is the best thing you can do to increase your chance at harvesting an animal
1667710 moving from north to south in the region our surveys suggest a general downward trend in fawn survival
1667711 that probably reflects how severe the winter was last year
1667712 because of that the deer will probably be widely scattered hunters will have to do a lot of scouting and stalking
1667713 because the deer will be scattered hunters need to hone their skills so they can make the most of the opportunities they get
1667714 the lower elevation and transition habitats have been affected by the hot dry summer in these areas youll likely see deer concentrated in places that have food and water
1667715 please be aware of that and take the steps needed to avoid letting any of the meat spoil
1667716 mountain vegetation is very green lush and abundant this year along the eastern half of the region
1667717 despite the extra heat over the last while there are many places in the mountains that look more like its june than late july if archers are patient and concentrate on well used game trails or water sources they should have an excellent chance at seeing deer
1667718 the region has several extended archery hunt units that you can hunt through much of december
1667719 several of my friends didnt get an archery deer tag because the archery deer permits sold out so early this year
1667720 but because the archery elk and deer opener begins on the same day this year ill still be able to hunt with these friends
1667721 archery elk tags are unlimited in number so i plan on hunting with my friends in our favorite elk areas if a nice buck deer comes along ill have the added option of taking a deer because i also have an archery deer tag
1667722 about 10 to 15 percent of the fawns that were born in that area in spring 2007 died this past winter
1667723 overall though deer herds in northeastern utah are in good shape
1667724 depending on where you hunt you can expect to see fair to good numbers of young bucks and those young bucks will be mixed in with a good number of older bucks
1667725 our biologists saw good numbers of fawns this spring several of the does even had twins
1667726 the losses were most pronounced in the northern part of the region we expect the harvest to be down a little this year from last year because there will be fewer yearling bucks
1667727 fawn survival was better on the lasal and abajo mountains we expect deer harvest in those areas to be about the same as last year
1667728 hunter success has been excellent during the past few years and it should not drop much this year even though some fawns were lost the number of older bucks that made it through the winter was about average this year
1667729 with the dry summer it will be important to hunt near water
1667730 get to know the area you plan to hunt identify springs seeps and creeks familiarize yourself with game trails bedding areas and escape routes
1667731 the deer are holding at high altitudes and i expect theyll stay there into the fall
1667732 recent rains have encouraged growth in the forage plants so the deer are in good condition
1667733 biologists are reporting good winter survival which translates into a good crop of young bucks
1667734 were also noticing a few mature bucks in most areas
1667735 can luke overcome his vain prejudice can jeris allow her tender heart to trust again will they let god show them the heart of the matter

1667745 i look forward to assisting both the riding and the next candidate in the upcoming election said morrissey a former provincial cabinet minister however a number of new opportunities have arisen in the private sector which make my continued candidacy untenable especially given the continued uncertainty over an election date
1667746 after a great deal of careful consideration and consultation i believe another individual should be offered the opportunity to contest the riding on behalf of the liberal party of canada
1667747 weve always said that u s residents are a tease for us because theyre right next door but we dont get the kinds of numbers wed like to get from there
1667748 this kind of attention from usa today is so valuable to us this will be seen all over the united states we could not afford to buy that much advertising space in usa today considering what they would probably charge for it
1667749 you cannot buy advertising like that the photo gallery would be seen all over the world for people who dont understand what the p e i tourism product is this article with its image gallery gives them a really good snapshot
1667750 the governments institutions are being used and clearly the decision was made under the personal directive of the prime minister
1667751 how could i insist that he be charged if there is no evidence the police are not stupid to charge it is up to them to decide
1667752 whether i am denied bail or not the campaign will continue
1667753 at this moment anwar has the upper hand in the campaign as everyone expects him to win
1667754 but the barisan ruling coalition strategy is to throw as much dirt as possible during the campaign so that even if he wins he will win with some tainted allegations
1667755 we believe that a transition of sorts has begun in malaysia but it is unclear how quickly things will change or even the degree of change that will take place
1667756 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
1667757 it is a promotion of the tobacco product marlboro because you cannot get into the red list without going through the website definitely it is a promotion of their product
1667758 i have a warning to the tobacco company if we are able to prove that this concert is actually sponsored by you philip morris definitely we will train our guns on you for violating the law
1667759 if theyre foreigners they shall be deported after serving sentence
1667760 that is why we only appeal to the organizers of the event to hopefully disassociate themselves from the tobacco company carry on with the event without the need of a tobacco companys sponsorship
1667761 the promotional event you refer to is an invitation only event not open to the general public it is restricted to our trade partners and to adult smokers who can obtain an invitation by registering on our adult only access website where they must provide proof of age through a government issued id
1667762 it doesnt matter whether it is for adults only event the point is there is an advertising ban advertising can refer to any age group or any sector the intention of the law is to stop their promotion because it affects the youth
1667763 im not telling the band not to push through with the concert
1667764 disassociate themselves from a product that is deadly or a killer
1667765 us singing star alicia keys has set a positive example that should be followed by musicians and entertainers worldwide by demanding the withdrawal of tobacco industry sponsorship of her july 31 concert
1667766 considered the most influential band in the country eraserheads has become a role model of sorts of our young i hope they will rise up to the challenge do more than play music and help young filipinos reach their potential which they cannot achieve when theyre ill or worse dead
1667767 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
1667768 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1667769 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1667770 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1667771 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder
1667772 i would not say that those people should not carry protection devices if they so feel but i honestly doubt about the efficiency unless they are carrying a new generation of masks i dont know

1667777 our peace panel had messed up this thing very badly it had brought the situation to a critical point where it is now a becoming more and more a matter of national security concern

1667779 im not one who would resign from a hard job but well ill think about what he says because hes a senator of the land im more challenged to do even better even more we cannot give up on peace

1667816 we were waiting for camel milk since a long time we read a lot of articles on it and also read about it in the encyclopedia we heard it is good for diabetic and improves a mans health i liked the taste and it costs just rupees 20 per litre it is available now and the taste is natural i advise all diabetic patients to consume this milk and also those ones who do not have any disease
1667817 i have been drinking this milk and i am over 80 years old and still fit one can stay physically fit and become strong by drinking camel milk it is a very good and disease resistant it is organic like all other natural products

1667840 these results are a significant step forward in the development of quantum computing
1667841 we hope that this work will open up a new field of physics where quantum coherence can be explored in solid crystals but at the same time we have brought a scalable silicon quantum computer a step nearer
1667842 our customers want to use microspectroscopy in production environments for rapid quality control of their products
1667843 he steve noticed the slightest traces of mortar adhering to pieces of flint in a field near st peters pit and michael and i followed up this sighting with a radar survey of the field
1667844 the results were spectacular not only did they locate the building but the radar showed that it survived in very good condition and was quite large not a simple cell or room but something that resembled a small church
1667845 it was probably built in the early 12th century and underwent a number of changes in ground plan
1667846 one particularly exciting find is a large section of the south wall of the church which collapsed inwards probably when the building was being dismantled for building materials in the 16th century
1667847 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1667848 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1667849 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1667850 the united states is obviously becoming increasingly popular due to the exchange rate of the dollar making what was once an expensive country to travel a lot more accessible

1667852 the poll proves that lego is a high quality toy that keeps being interesting to children and adults because of its creative possibilities its so simple but has so much potential
1667853 a key toy trend for winter 2008 is high tech with the strong emergence of electronic and gaming toys but there is also a revitalisation of classics like lego and rubiks cube and with kids growing up fast these traditional classics will always be important in offering parents a balance of traditional and modern toys for their children

1667861 sunwater advise me that medium priority water allocations for irrigators in the burnett section of the bundaberg water supply scheme will be raised to 40 from the current 26
1667862 allocations for irrigators in the kolan section will now be increased to 100 up from 92
1667863 these increases could not have come at a better time for the many burnett river irrigators who have been struggling after the traditional wet season rains failed to arrive last summer to replenish the regions dams
1667864 the additional water will put our burnett river farmers in a much better position than they were in at the start of the water year in july
1667865 this has created a situation where thousands of cats and dogs are being destroyed each year as a government we have to help our councils and other stakeholders to address this serious issue
1667866 its not just unwanted adult cats and dogs that are being put to death its kittens and puppies as well all because we dont have the necessary laws and practices in place to impose a degree of responsible pet ownership
1667867 its needless and senseless and we have got to do more to put a stop to it
1667868 in addition to trialling different methods of encouraging identification and de sexing they will also collect baseline data to monitor the numbers of levels of animals being euthanased
1667869 the government will support these councils in trialling these new programs and has committed 380 000 to help councils do so
1667870 the code of practice will not only inform the development of legislation for the sale of animals but it also will help reaffirm the commitment of the industry to animal welfare issues
1667871 citi field will serve as a fantastic new home for the mets for decades to come but fans will always remember shea stadium and its magical moments from the amazins world series triumph in 1969 to game 6 in 86 to hopefully a long sweet october in 2008
1667872 the beatles played the first concert at shea in 1965 and what better way to close it out than with billy joel and paul mccartney on stage together 43 years later the seat sale and subsequent memorabilia sale will provide fans a chance to own a part of that shea stadium lore
1667873 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team
1667874 it showed us in no uncertain terms we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
1667875 you can never under estimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
1667876 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident we wont be taking anything for granted
1667877 i know everybody will be working flat out to make sure we can be strong in all the remaining races
1667878 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event
1667879 from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this one looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places
1667880 as a driver its always fun to go to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly
1667881 i am pleased that my nominations for the new board have received support and i believe we now have an excellent team led by harvey mcgrath who has done a terrific job in a short time at the lda refocusing the agency on its priorities and restoring public confidence in its role his wealth of experience can be shared across the organisation and is exactly the right person to steer the lda on its new course giving value for money in its delivery of the skills jobs and regeneration that will keep london ahead of its competitors
1667882 fema recognizes the extraordinary circumstances that families devastated by the chapman tornado face when rebuilding ensuring that they can rebuild safely from all hazards flood and tornadoes is of paramount concern to us
1667883 at the same time fema and the nfip are committed to ensuring that new development is done in a way that is both sustainable and flood resistant doing so makes people safer and ensures that federal flood insurance remains available and affordable nationwide
1667884 fema will work closely with the city of chapman so that owners of substantially damaged structures can build back with basements in a manner that upholds our shared goals of tornado and flood hazard reduction while ensuring affordable flood insurance premiums for building owners
1667885 i dont think they were particularly good massa had a good race but kimi wasnt particularly strong
1667886 really the outcome of the first corner was that people could see massa in the lead and who was in second place but we switched into fuel strategy mode to make sure that we stopped second to him in order that we could do a long second stint and overtake him at the final stop
1667887 the slightly flat spotted tyre and the puncture put paid to that strategy but i think that lewis had the pace to win
1667888 confidence is a weakness youve just got to take every race as it is i dont think theres any doubt that were in for a very competitive world championship and its going to be a close race between ourselves and ferrari
1667889 securing series three of television drama sea patrol red gold is a major boon for our local film and television industry
1667890 the 13 part series will return to shoot on location at mission beach in far north queensland and also at the warner roadshow studios on the gold coast from september
1667891 the bligh government is providing production development and investment funding for the third series through the pacific film and television commission pftc
1667892 the third series has a 17 million budget and looks set to create around 400 jobs
1667893 pftc also provided development and production funding for the two previous series of sea patrol which were also shot on location in queensland and have both rated very well for the nine network since the first series screened in 2007
1667894 with veteran television producers hal and di mcelroy blue heelers water rats at the helm sea patrol is a high quality australian television series
1667895 the success of a program like sea patrol is evidence of the high quality of production talent in queensland and also the variety and beauty of our locations
1667896 queensland has proved itself as a location of choice for tv and film producers
1667897 this reputation will be further enhanced when drama series the strip another queensland based production which has received pftc production incentives makes its much anticipated debut on the nine network later this year
1667898 student success begins with school safety and thats why we continue to working hard to cut crime and violence in schools
1667899 the nypd department of education and schools officials have all worked collaboratively to ensure that schools are a safe place for students their efforts are succeeding and are giving our children the safe learning environments that they deserve and that all parents have every right to expect
1667900 crime is down city wide again this year crime in the subways is at its lowest in memory and crime in school is down dramatically its not a coincidence that crime is down on all fronts
1667901 the common denominator in all instances is dedicated police officers and in the case of the schools dedicated school safety agents teamed with police officers working together with school officials they have all done great work so children can learn in safety
1667902 safety is a prerequisite to learning in our schools and classrooms only when hallways and classrooms are safe and secure can our students concentrate learn and excel
1667903 we owe thanks to commissioner kelly our school safety agents and all of the educators who have worked so hard to make our schools much safer for new york city public school students in the last school year
1667904 these historic drops in crime are the product of the combined efforts of all school communities teachers administrators school safety agents and police
1667905 safe classrooms and hallways are a critical prerequisite for high academic achievement and healthy social development and we owe our children nothing less
1667906 parents need to know that their childrens schools are safe and i am impressed by what we and the administration have been able to accomplish through collaboration
1667907 now we must continue our efforts to make every classroom a learning environment free from disruption and that means strict enforcement of school discipline codes
1667908 educating students in a safe and secure learning environment is paramount to school leaders thats why csa meets regularly with school safety and the nypd
1667909 this decline in incidents is a reflection of the hard work of educators and school safety agents working together to address student issues and to ensure school safety we must also continue to focus on conflict resolution for our neediest students
1667910 at the high school of graphic communication arts we were effective in reducing crime because we implemented a guidance approach to student issues that helped us address problems before they escalated
1667911 we could not have done this without the support of office of school and youth development ceo elayna konstan and her team and school support organization network leader michael laforgia and ceo judith chin thank you

1667914 our survey reveals a wide gap between the perception homeowners have about their own homes value and the realities of a market in which three quarters of homes declined in value in the past year we attribute this gap to a combination of inattention and a fair bit of denial that causes people to believe their home is insulated from the woes of the market that affect others but not them
1667915 this sentiment is also carried through in homeowner confidence for the short term as more people expect their home to perform better in the next six months than the market and recent past although many homeowners may believe the worst is over we think this level of optimism is out of sync with actual market performance

1667919 since august banks have been absorbing a significant increase in funding costs due to the impacts of the us sub prime lending crisis on global liquidity and the wholesale funding markets
1667920 while we have already completed our wholesale funding requirements for this financial year the spread between cash rates and 90 day rates in particular remains significantly higher for the industry than a year ago

1667929 over the past four years sony bmg has undertaken a very successful restructuring streamlined operations and developed innovative digital partnerships that ensure it will continue to be a leader in the creation and distribution of music worldwide
1667930 the cloud is delighted to be working with myspace to provide many millions of its users free access to their music video and friends over cloud wi fi
1667931 we expect apple will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow
1667932 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer
1667933 we have always focused on making things simple for users and it
1667934 this provides us with the opportunity to take the complexity away for enterprises
1667935 with a more mature market mobile operators are seeing their service revenue come under pressure and driven by lower flat rate tariffs demand for data services is starting to pick up increasing demand for network investment
1667936 cost control and putting pressure on supplier pricing are the business norm of operators hence mobile device vendors are experiencing increased pressure on device pricing
1667937 for the second half of the year we expect sales in the third quarter to be more than the second quarter results but only moderately as both motorola and lg issued warnings for a sequential drop in sales as well as an economic environment that remains challenging
1667938 china telecom will have a relatively stronger position to offer fixed mobile and multiple play bundled services ie voice broadband iptv and mobile given its leading position in the fixed and broadband market the relatively lower cost and faster to market to upgrade cdma networks for 3g services in comparison with china mobiles td network relative stronger brand marketing and customer field service in the potential multiple play bundled services market
1667939 customer service transformation shift from fixed location to on the move customer care
1667940 our partnership with networks first means that we will now be working in conjunction with one of the uks leading specialist providers of converged network support services we were looking for a partner who offers both quality to our customers and investment in a long term relationship
1667941 networks first delivers additional value to us through industry leading back office systems marketing support and knowledgeable responsive account managers we are extremely pleased to be able to provide our clients with multi vendor network support services which go way beyond the traditional break fix approach still being offered by so many
1667942 we are delighted to welcome massip as a new networks first partner as a partner focused organisation networks firsts proposition is based on enabling mutual business development through commitment to and investment in its partners
1667943 we have seen so many data breaches recently and they all compromised large amounts of data
1667944 they need to analyse their bank statements and call up credit check companies so they are aware of fraudsters trying to take up loan agreements
1667945 we are pleased with our better than expected fourth quarter results excluding certain items our sequential performance improved significantly with operating income growing roughly 12 per cent while return on capital employed improved by 113 basis points
1667946 in fiscal 2008 our focus on value based management and value creating m amp a resulted in record financial results despite the challenging macro economic forces impacting our markets

1667972 the more violence was involved in the emancipation process the worse the outcomes were making a provocative case for peaceful antislavery strategies
1667973 were to inspire abolitionists in the united states and abroad and they helped change history
1667974 an estimated 50 000 slaves were also brought into the u s between 1807 and 1860
1667975 republicans promoted government spending schemes that resulted in skyrocketing taxes
1667976 tax rates in the region in 1870 were three or four times what they had been in 1860
1667977 although the war brought the end of chattel slavery the resulting death and destruction intensified the determination of former slaveholders and their allies to suppress blacks
1667978 the military strategy for abolishing slavery was no short cut
1667979 the idea that the federal government would protect blacks was an illusion because they were a minority and a minority isnt likely to control government in a democracy
1667980 some people have objected that the united states couldnt have bought the freedom of all the slaves because this would have cost too much but buying the freedom of slaves was not more expensive than war nothing is more costly than war the costs include people killed or disabled destroyed property high taxes inflation military expenditures shortages war related famines and epidemics the billions of dollars of union military expenditures during the civil war would have been better spent reducing the number of slaveholders and slaves accelerating progress toward total emancipation
1667981 s lavery was being eroded throughout the west by political trends and relentless agitation the process would have continued and perhaps accelerated without the civil war
1667982 there would have come a time much sooner than most people might expect when the combined effects of multiple antislavery strategies would have brought about the fairly peaceful collapse of confederate slavery if this seems doubtful just recall how a combination of pressures led the mighty soviet union to collapse and vanish from the map without a nuclear war

1667999 gary is the victim of dented pride for showing how insecure the us computer systems are
1668000 if he can hack into them what price any other hostile government can also the us should be pleased that flaws in their systems have been shown up and employ hackers to break into other systems to show their security which can then be improved
1668001 i dont think that the us should be using gary as a scapegoat to cover their own inadequacies and slack attitude to security
1668002 the probable reality is that they will extradite gary take him to a classified location guantanamo bay and interview torture him for a while until he confesses to everything they want him to
1668003 if theres nothing to worry about why not come to the us where you will face a trial
1668004 own up and man up to what you did as the saying goes dont do the crime if you cant do the time you are apparently not that bright if you didnt consider that while you were hacking those systems

1668023 sono tornato a san paolo da un paio di giorni ha detto massa in unintervista al sito internet del cavallino ho provato a dimenticare la domenica di budapest ma piuttosto difficile non voglio per scordare tutto del gp dungheria perch in un certo senso stata una delle mie migliori gare in f 1 ma non finita come le altre cio con una vittoria stato davvero un peccato perch credo che io e la squadra meritassimo il successo abbiamo fatto una corsa quasi perfetta in un momento molto importante del campionato purtroppo non abbiamo portato a casa 10 punti che erano gi nelle nostre mani stato molto frustrante ma sono cose che succedono qualche volta nel nostro sport
1668024 purtroppo non doveva essere la mia giornata ha detto quando il motore ha ceduto ho sentito una strana sensazione mi sembrava di vivere in un incubo e quindi volevo svegliarmi ma non potevo perch ero gi sveglio stata una grande delusione questo sport pu essere davvero crudele guardando alla classifica almeno posso consolarmi con il fatto che nemmeno lewis ha vinto ma non possiamo permetterci di gettare via dei punti in questo modo ne abbiamo persi dieci ma se volessi prendere qualcosa di positivo dallo scorso weekend allora vorrei dire che abbiamo dimostrato di andare forte
1668025 anche la squadra ha fatto un bellissimo lavoro per tutto il fine settimana ha concluso felipe in termini di strategia e di sforzo profuso nel correggere i problemi emersi in inghilterra e germania abbiamo lavorato duramente per rendere di nuovo competitiva la macchina il che una buona indicazione per le prossime corse dobbiamo per risolvere i rimanenti problemi abbiamo bisogno di essere competitivi come a budapest ma dobbiamo migliorare come affidabilit non possiamo ripetere certi errori non abbiamo pi scusanti
1668026 perch si chiede allo sport di fare quello che la politica non riesce a fare rinunciando a sfilare nel giorno pi atteso da tanti atleti
1668027 e perch invece nessuno ha mai chiesto la stessa cosa agli industriali italiani che investono in cina ci hanno insegnato sin da piccoli che la pi alta istituzione dello stato il presidente della repubblica bene il presidente napolitano ha consegnato ad antonio rossi il tricolore ed suo dovere portarlo nello stadio olimpico con le altre squadre certo gli atleti hanno la libert di esprimere il proprio pensiero io sono per il massimo rispetto per le idee altrui ma siamo ai giochi olimpici e ci sono regole cio che devono essere rispettate sarei dispiaciutissimo se qualcuno di loro dovesse esprimere qualche protesta in luoghi non deputati
1668028 che stanno facendo una battaglia sera e concreta limportante che non si transiga chi ha sbagliato dovr pagare e pagher continua il capo dello sport italiano ma c un altro modo ancora pi efficace per combattere il doping gli atleti devono fare i nomi e collaborare allindividuazione dei responsabili
1668029 gi 24 ore dopo il primo approccio le valutazione dei lloyds era al ribasso spiega pagnozzi segno che anche per loro la squadra italiana si presenta con le carte in regola per ottenere un buon numero di medaglie
1668030 lasciate che i vostri giocatori partecipino ai giochi sarebbe meraviglioso per loro per i tifosi e per lo sport lopionione della fifa non cambiata il torneo olimpico unopportunit unica per un calciatore
1668031 ma anche al suo club mi dispiace che il tas non abbia tenuto in considerazione lo spirito olimpico
1668032 leo ha annunciato far parte della formazione di domani e rester con noi per tutta la competizione
1668033 i giocatori sono convocati continuano a far parte del gruppo e domani giocheranno noi ci adeguiamo alle decisioni della fifa

1668091 jade is an element that many people around the world associate with china and historically it has been considered the imperial gem
1668092 i think maybe sonny might not have that long in the game with the injuries he had maybe he thinks he does not have much longer in the game and needs to get out of it what he can

1668180 we could add some new stuff to him but for the most part curses corpse explosion skeleton pets done thats the class we wanted to create new gameplay so we chose to do the witch doctor as a different kind of class
1668181 if the necromancer dealt damage it was through corpses laying around or through his pets
1668182 the witch doctor his pets are a little more transient if you watch the gameplay video you really notice his pets come and go like crazy theres a wall of zombies that go away fairly quickly or pets that just kind of blow up willy nilly that was intentional to try and make him different than the necromancer

1668186 behold the might of the new song it has made men out of stones men out of beasts those moreover that were as dead not being partakers of the true life have come to life again simply by becoming listeners to this song it also composed the univere into melodious order and tuned the discord of the elements to harmonious arrangement so that the whole world might become harmony it let loose the fluid ocean and yet has prevented it from encroaching on the land the earth again which had been in a state of commotion it has established and fixed the sea as its boundary the violence of fire it has softened by the atmosphere as the dorian is blended with the lydian strain and the harsh cold of the air it has moderated by the embrace of fire harmoniously arranging these the extreme tones of the universe and this deathless strain the support of the whole and the harmony of all reaching from the centre to the circumference and from the extremities to the central part has harmonized this universal frame of things not according to the thracian music which is like that invented by jubal but according to the paternal counsel of god which fired the zeal of david and he who is of david and yet before him the word of god despising the lyre and harp which are but lifeless instruments and having tuned by the holy spirit the universe and especially man who composed of body and soul is a universe in miniature makes melody to god on this instrument of many tones and to this instrument i mean man he sings accordant for you are my harp and pipe and temple a harp for harmony a pipe by reason of the spirit a temple by reason of the word so that the first may sound the second breathe the third contain the lord and david the king the harper whom we mentioned a little above who exhorted to the truth and dissuaded from idols was so far from celebrating demons in song that in reality they were driven away by his music thus when saul was plagued with a demon he cured him by merely playing a beautiful breathing instrument of music the lord made man after his own image and he himself also surely who is the supramundane wisdom the celestial word is the all harmonious melodious holy instrument of god what then does this instrument the word of god the lord the new song desire to open the eyes of the blind and unstop the ears of the deaf and to lead the lame or the erring to righteousness to exhibit god to the foolish to put a stop to corruption to conquer death to reconcile disobedient children to their father the instrument of god loves mankind the lord pities instructs exhorts admonishes saves shields and of his bounty promises us the kingdom of heaven as a reward for learning and the only advantage he reaps is that we are saved for wickedness feeds on mens destruction but truth like the bee harming nothing delights only in the salvation of men
1668187 if therefore the world is an instrument in tune and moving in well measured time i adore the being who gave its harmony and strikes its notes and sings the accordant strain and not the instrument for at the musical contests the adjudicators do not pass by the lute players and crown the lutes
1668188 by this he at once takes away hatred and quells pride and casts out envy and brings in the mother of all good things even charity and exterminates the inequality of human beings and shows how far the equality reaches between the king and the poor man if at least in those things which are greatest and most indispensable we are all of us fellows for what harm comes of our kindred below when in that which is on high we are all of us knit together and no one hath aught more than another neither the rich more that the poor nor the master than the servant neither the ruler than the subject nor the king than the common soldier nor the philosopher than the barbarian nor the skillful than the unlearned for to all hath he given one nobility having vouchsafed to be called the father of all alike
1668189 now since man is a rational animal the instrument of his body must be made suitable for the use of reason as you may see musicians producing their music according to the form of their instruments and not piping with harps nor harping upon flutes so it must needs be that the organization of these instruments of ours should be adapted for reason that when struck by the vocal organs it might be able to sound properly for the use of words
1668190 for this reason the hands were attached to the body for though we can count up very many uses in daily life for which these skilfully contrived and helpful instruments our hands that easily follow every art and every operation alike in war and peace are serviceable yet nature added them to our body pre eminently for the sake of reason for if man were destitute of hands the various parts of his face would certainly have been arranged like those of the quadrupeds to suit the purpose of his feeding so that its form would have been lengthened out and pointed towards the nostrils and his lips would have projected from his mouth lumpy and stiff and thick fitted for taking up the grass and his tongue would either have lain between his teeth of a kind to match his lips fleshy and hard and rough assisting his teeth to deal with what came under his grinder or it would have been moist and hanging out at the side like that of dogs and other carnivorous beasts projecting through the gaps in his jagged row of teeth if then our body had no hands how could articulate sound have been implanted in it seeing that the form of the parts of the mouth would not have had the configuration proper for the use of speech so that man must of necessity have either bleated or baaed or barked or neighed or bellowed like oxen or asses or uttered some bestial sound but now as the hand is made part of the body the mouth is at leisure for the service of the reason thus the hands are shown to be the property of the rational nature the creator having thus devised by their means a special advantage for reason

1668202 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1668203 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm
1668204 cases like this send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1668205 we think that these activities and these excessive delays are artificially manufactured to give the american society of civil engineers time time to protect its own reputation time to discredit those coming forward with ethics violations time so that others coming forward with supporting information will be obstructed and intimidated and probably worst of all time so that the american publics attention will turn elsewhere

1668374 once again any given nine think theyre going to play in a conference championship
1668375 i dont know if you see that anywhere else in america
1668376 id trade the heisman for a national championship any day of the week
1668377 it was a dream come true to win the heisman but it doesnt compare to a national championship
1668378 jo det har jag nog visst varit n gon g ng n r jag var liten
1668379 a lot of what were going to do in the near future hinges on holder and his decision to come back to school or go pro
1668380 with the type of leadership he brings to the table id feel very confident about next season if he decides to come back
1668381 if we can stop this good year bad year jinx for one year i think we can stay off it for good
1668382 i do feel better about what we have coming back in 2009 than i did in 2007 and 2005 in terms of leadership we have good enough players to weather the storm
1668383 the key to our success in 2008 was that we had so many guys that played a part in our cws berth in 2006 you look at how the returnees at north carolina and oregon state kept the torch going and kept things at a high level thats our goal for 2009
1668384 from my standpoint from where we were in 2007 to where we ended the 2008 season it was pretty amazing in one sense in another sense it was disappointing considering how close we were to winning the title
1668385 the best remedy for this program is to start working and preparing for 2009
1668386 our drafted high school signees are expected to show up and i really dont think thats going to change between now and august 15
1668387 if that happens our talent definitely is good enough to win at a high level we just need to set the tone for the future
1668388 what we did in omaha this past season really helps us because it raises the accountability for the returning players
1668389 for us to put back to back good years together the players must come back with some pride and a sense of tradition
1668390 i wasnt scared at first because there were many other boys there
1668391 but then they told me to take off my clothes
1668392 they told me if i go to the doctor im not a real man
1668393 the ones who attend this year by next year theyre taking the other ones because the school owners promise them money
1668394 they tell them its a nice place that theyre eating nice food and once theyre there they have no chance to run away
1668395 if theyre caught before they see what is going on there they can be turned away but the problem is if theyve gone in and theyve seen something according to custom after youve seen the secret you cant be turned away
1668396 for now there are about eight coming for regular dressings but most of them wont allow a woman to see that area so when they come home they dont tell the mothers theres a problem
1668397 they laugh at them they side line them especially leading up to the initiation season
1668398 my nephew used to go and stay in town with my daughter to avoid it but this year he went to the school he said he was tired of hiding
1668399 i didnt want them to go to the mountain its not safe
1668400 it was cold and he cant stay in the cold
1668401 i tell my people not to go to initiation schools i think its a waste of time in our tradition there are good things and bad things and in my place i discard the bad things
1668402 some are registered but i dont think it means anything in the past year many accidents have happened
1668403 once they have permission they might run six schools in one year which means they cant look after all the boys
1668404 it does happen that some people who run these things see it as a money making scheme
1668405 if somebody goes against the regulations they can be fined in a court of law
1668406 if you knew your potential to feel good you would ask no one to be different so that you can feel good for no one else can think for you no one else can do it it is only you every bit of it you
1668407 a la espera de la constituci n de la mesa con los sindicatos
1668408 un marco de acuerdo con los representantes de los trabajadores
1668409 desde el govern como es evidente no nos gusta nada que se lleven la base operativa de aqu porque eso tiene un coste sobre una serie de trabajadores no creemos que sea una medida acertada
1668410 i wanted to live somewhere where i could be green
1668411 what happens is due to the extreme changes in temperature the fiberglas tanks would crack
1668412 i figure i am saving about 1 000 a year
1668413 whether you are an environmentalist or not it has actually become worth it for almost anyone to go ahead and do it
1668414 were still waiting to see if it will pencil out
1668415 i hope this is the start of solar being viable
1668416 when i owned mine i had to open the door to light the fireplace because there isnt any kind of draft
1668417 give me a noun give me an adjective give me an adverb etc
1668418 the motor she is running she is a hearse in reverse i must not put my foot on the gas pedal i must not give in
1668419 i think for an august election the turnout will be high because of the contested countywide sheriffs race probably
1668420 normally an august election does not get that much attention
1668421 you should have waited a week your hair is too short
1668422 you are my favorite oldest son you are my favorite youngest son
1668423 this discovery shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1668424 this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species
1668425 as i mentioned before i am not a wipes person but back in may when i became an advocate i purchased the bathroom wipes along with the entire bathroom line and the wipes have been sitting on the tank of my toilet bowl since i purchased them

1668429 my vehicle was parked in an end bay next to an information sign and it was not possible for any other vehicle to park on my nearside either that day or for that matter on any other day
1668430 as it happens i did not realise that my two nearside wheels were slightly on the line but naturally one has to leave enough space to vacate ones own vehicle without damaging the door of the adjacent vehicle this is courteous parking surely
1668431 my vehicle had a valid parking ticket as i do abide by the law but i like many other people will now find it preferable to visit handforth dean instead of wilmslow to avoid the over zealous and extremely officious civil enforcement officers who seem to take great delight in persecuting pensioners like myself
1668432 this fine has been unfairly awarded as no other vehicle was ever able to park on my nearside
1668433 do we really have to live in such a persecuted way and is this what we pay our taxes for
1668434 a ver zorras que una de ustedes vaya a mi casa a lavarme los platos ya mismo y de las dem s qui n quiere hacerme una buena mamada eh venga demuestren para qu sirven
1668435 mrsa is often linked to cleanliness but this is about technique infection can occur when cannulae are not inserted properly
1668436 what has been identified is an issue with some of the ward staffs methods of doing a cannula
1668437 it is a concern we are hearing of these cases on a regular basis but a lot of them could be easily avoided
1668438 cannulae shouldnt be inserted unless absolutely necessary unfortunately in most hospitals they are a routine procedure whether needed or not
1668439 if you are entering a vein you must be expert and training must be done frequently it is not like injecting into a muscle
1668440 it is something not all nurses are trained to do i am not myself being injected intravenously means an infection travels within the blood very quickly
1668441 what we are learning from is individual cases four is a very small number and stands up to comparison
1668442 the clostridium difficile rate is also dropping and i think that is down to our cleanliness agenda
1668443 there is no implication of blame or negligence in these cases bacteraemia is a well recognised risk when inserting lines into the blood system
1668444 the cannulae were identified as a high risk factor rather than the definitive cause of the bacteraemia
1668445 such cannulae are inserted for a variety of reasons but particularly to ensure rapid access for drugs and fluids to very sick patients
1668446 mike lived in his cottage next door to us for 72 of his 73 years he was known as mr styal to a lot of the residents here because of all the work he did for the village
1668447 he was chairman of styal village association for 20 years or more
1668448 mike was a big social larger than life character he has done much for charity work and he annually dressed up as father christmas at several schools in the area by donning the red outfit he already had the big white beard
1668449 he was well known in vintage car circles he was a member of the lee francis owners club the daimler owners club and historic vehicle club which meant he went to lots of car shows only last month he won a shield at tatton park for one of his own vintage vehicles
1668450 mike was a great man very inspirational jovial and full of good cheer he will be missed by an awful lot of people in styal
1668451 there are not many people let alone footballers who are like ole it has been a big joy and a source of motivation to work with him
1668452 for a small club to perform this well at a national event is fantastic
1668453 you can achieve what you want against the odds with determination persistence and motivation anyone can achieve their dreams when the odds are stacked against you as long as you believe in yourself and have faith then you can go far
1668454 when you have people knocking you back sometimes it can be hard but i have always just wanted to keep going and reach as high as i can go
1668455 too often people with disabilities are referred to as disabled but the term disabled is negative a disability is just one of numerous facets of the person each person has gifts and talents i hope that what i have achieved will inspire others
1668456 i found my own notes more useful the note takers were not as conscientious as taking your own
1668457 whenever id get a bit down they would encourage me to carry on
1668458 they said prayers and it makes all the difference the administration staff in international relations were so very friendly and encouraged me too
1668459 we are delighted with marias success especially after the tremendous determination she has shown we have always known that she had something special and she has made us very proud parents
1668460 hopefully this will inspire a lot of parents who face negative predictions as to their childrens limitations just believe in your own child
1668461 you must come back youre urgently wanted on the phone
1668462 through the co operation of the university of manchester in england therefore use of the 250ft telescope at jodrell bank was obtained the graduate students working for sir bernard lovell at jodrell bank in recording their intercept narrowed the receiver bandwidth so far in order to increase signal to noise ratio that they clipped off much of the video information confirmation that the lunik iii luna 3 pictures released by the soviets were valid thus rested on a single poorly recorded intercept from which it could be judged that the picture was more likely to be of a test pattern than of the moon the signal bandwidth however was compatible with the parameters announced by the soviets and on the basis of technical extrapolation it could be concluded that the soviet lunar pictures were authentic
1668463 it was about 12 15pm and my sister beryl and i had just sat down to a meal in the kitchen because we were supposed to be celebrating her birthday then we heard a horrendous crash
1668464 it was a real shock and we came rushing into the living room to find a police car under the living room window and glass and dirt all over the floor and setee
1668465 the police said they are going to board up the window and then we are just going to have to wait for someone from the insurance company to come round to assess the damage
1668466 there have been numerous accidents on the bend before the row of cottages where the speed has been reduced from 40mph to 30mph to slow traffic down but residents now want speed cameras
1668467 its only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed theres been lots of walls knocked down all along this row of houses
1668468 we cant even get builders to do work around here because none of them dare park in front of the houses in case their vans get hit
1668469 we desperately need traffic calming measures i have been telling the council that since i moved in the 30 mph signs dont work because no one sticks to them and most people usually drive at speeds of between 45 and 50 mph
1668470 we heard the crash and came running out of the house and saw the police car in next doors garden it seems the police officer was answering a 999 call when it happened it was just an accident
1668471 but this is a bad accident blackspot and to make it worse the roads on this occasion were slippery because of the rain it was no ones fault
1668472 we have been looking for a bigger store as weve closed our store at cheshire oaks
1668473 the original idea was to look for a stand alone premises like the old gabor on altrincham road with its own car park
1668474 i spotted a place next to the co op in knutsford was empty and weve decided to go for it
1668475 we would have entertained somewhere four times bigger in wilmslow but its ridiculous rent
1668476 for not much more than were paying in wilmslow we are getting a store four times the size
1668477 some fantastic shops have closed over the past five years
1668478 my strong feeling with wilmslow is it has the reputation as being a place to shop hoopers is still a big draw but a lot of others are being replaced by increasingly dull shops
1668479 theres lots of restaurants and coffee shops which is great but people come to wilmslow to go shopping and then have coffee
1668480 i feel the council has been blinded in allowing certain businesses and shops to come along its not good for wilmslow that the less appealing shops are coming to the area as we are going to lose the shops which bring people to the area in the first place
1668481 the ridiculous rents they landlords are charging does push out the little people knutsford has lots of expensive and original stores while wilmslow is only enticing the bigger businesses and the companies which have got the money behind them because of higher rent
1668482 the nicest bit of wilmslow is actually down water lane rather than grove street the main pedestrianised area
1668483 its shabby and grubby and boring types of shops which make it less appealing
1668484 we want to be able to give the new store our full focus
1668485 while chat itself would not impose any serious security risks in terms of viruses todays im applications are far from being just chatting tools most of them support more or less sophisticated file sharing methods which may quite easily lead to virus infections if not properly monitored
1668486 it is a generic scanner working on the smtp pop3 imap4 nntp protocol level it is capable of protecting any existing e mail client that uses these protocols
1668487 this module provides protection against known internet worms attacks it analyses all network traffic and scans it for malicious contents it can be viewed as a lightweight firewall or more precisely an ids intrusion detection system
1668488 the p2p protection module doesnt need much explanation on todays p2p networks such as kazaa there are thousands of infected files and an effective protection is a must
1668489 file system protection ensures that no virus will be started on the computer it offers a wide range of settings such as the possibility to specify that files will be scanned during copying or that the scanning will include files with given set of extensions only
1668490 web shield is a unique feature of avast that enables it to monitor and filter all http traffic coming from the web sites on the internet since an increasing number of viruses and other malware such as adware spyware and dialers are being distributed via the world wide web the need for an effective countermeasures has also increased the web shield acts as a transparent http proxy and is compatible with all major web browsers including microsoft internet explorer firefox mozilla and opera

1668525 im in a time of rediscovery from my career to my personal style i was looking through my pre pregnancy clothes and found so much i had forgotten about
1668526 if the young players work hard at their game listen to the advice of the coaching staff they realise they will have every opportunity here the manager has always said he will play them if they are good enough and he is true to his word he always has been in every way
1668527 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1668528 you have to adapt to the physical aspects of the game and i think jack is strong enough it is about how you physically develop and i think with jack even at 16 it doesnt mean he wont be as physically strong as someone at 18 or even someone at 20
1668529 that has been the benefit of our reserve team the experienced players that our lads are up against means they learn on the pitch the senior players then show them what to do while the game is going on that is carried on for the young lads who learned so much in austria

1668535 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument
1668536 it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion
1668537 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse
1668538 however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1668539 businesses in particular will find todays figures worrying because for many firms the congestion charge has put up costs or driven away trade

1668548 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable
1668549 the consumer sector is bearing the brunt of the credit crisis with falling asset prices negative real wage growth and rising
1668550 we suspect that most monetary policy committee members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1668551 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1668552 a husbands job is to earn income a wifes to take care of the children
1668553 there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family

1668569 i like teenagers because of their enormous passion and their peeled back emotional quality and i think you only feel that way during that window in your life but its also the period at which people start to form the habit of being a reader for life
1668570 and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1668571 im paris hilton and i approve this message because i think its totally hot
1668572 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1668573 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
1668574 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1668575 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1668576 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1668577 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1668578 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1668579 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1668580 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1668581 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1668582 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1668583 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1668584 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation

1668636 i was raped beaten and burned just because i had nowhere to go and wouldnt do what someone wanted me to homeless women are especially bullied
1668637 if you are a woman one of the worst experiences of being homeless is when your period comes the lack of hygiene and the humiliation is hard to describe simple things are suddenly so complicated you have to go and find some place to clean up and its not always easy a man does not have these problems

1668651 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1668652 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
1668653 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1668654 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1668655 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1668656 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together

1668735 its no secret that americans spend little time thinking through the deeper applications and implications of their beliefs in a society confronted with challenging issues such as immigration rights gay marriage war and environmental crises our positions on such matters should come from a well conceived and deeply embraced theology of life sadly most americans react on an emotional level rather than from a worldview that is based on thoughtful convictions perhaps having a mormon or jehovahs witness ringing our doorbell and pushing us to explain or defend our beliefs could be a catalyst for an even deeper process of discovery especially if we enter the conversation knowing that we probably have some substantial disagreements on core elements of faith

1668792 our biggest question right now is getting our life support systems working so we have enough for six person crew

1668795 that water is going to be used not just for drinking and food preparation but also for oxygen generation
1668796 and i think thats a key component of life support because i think were all addicted to breathing
1668797 recycling will be an essential part of daily life for future astronauts whether on board the space station or living on the moon

1668810 the u s understands that india will not sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty this was the basis of the negotiations with which we had gone forward and that was addressed throughout the negotiations he told journalists here over phone from washington on tuesday
1668811 unconditional is not a very good word in this context there is a huge amount of work on this understanding and therefore to use the word unconditional to me is oversimplification i will be hoping only for a clean exemption that is my personal view and not of the u s government
1668812 the u s congress is a sovereign body and it has its own procedure and rules so at this point nobody really knows whether it will be able to act in the very short period of time at its disposal what we are trying is to position the 123 agreement in congress the goal is to complete the nsg process in august and submit it in early september
1668813 the notice period can be changed but it is not possible to speak on behalf of congress
1668814 we want to underline that we have already shared the draft with india we want to get the right sort of draft that will be most effective with the nsg in the coming days we will complete the work and distribute it to nsg members
1668815 people to listen seriously and hope at the end of the day they will accept we would not wish to see the additional points raised so that they become part of the process this is a very complex process and we are now moving to the final stage and obviously we hope that all players come together at the nsg and accept that the aim of this to normalise civilian nuclear process with india

1668861 we were sitting there eating dinner at my place and he looked at my dog and said cant you just put him out on the porch or something
1668862 so i looked at him for a minute then i said you know i just dont think this is going to work
1668863 because after all i have been through with my puppy how many times he almost died because he was so sick how i had to put him on a plane and send him back to the breeder wondering if he would survive the flight and thinking i would never see him again and now i finally have him back again no one is going to tell me to just stick him on the porch you know
1668864 because you can tell a lot about a guy based on the way they treat your dog at least thats what i think
1668865 and this guy barely tolerated my puppy all along so guess what bye
1668866 not really sad even though i liked him i just knew i should end it before anyone got hurt
1668867 no really dont its part of the game at least thats what my friends tell me
1668868 and were not supposed to be so available guys like the chase or the thrill of the hunt or some such crap

1668938 the great sioux shaman black elk speaks of walking in a sacred manner to walk in a sacred manner is to make an art of life to attend to each moment as though it were the last to take each step as though it were the first to breathe love and awareness into this tiny body entering the greater body we all share when we walk in a sacred manner nothing throws us off balance for nothing is identified as self or the walker but instead all is experienced as the sacred as process unfolding as the divine moment provided for our healing

1668942 the story about anakin skywalker and his fall into the dark side and redemption by his son thats finished it was started when he was 10 it ends when he died theres no more story to tell all that stuff is really not part of what this is
1668943 when i was a kid imagining that there were other jedi knights beyond yoda was incredible weve never really seen those other characters fully developed and thats one thing we can really get into in this movie and in this series
1668944 also there are a lot of the clones that we can get involved with on the front lines and see just how they all contributed to this great republic that we always heard about in star wars and how it falls apart and becomes an empire
1668945 i try to stay very closely tied to the live action films as far as i dont want to interrupt the continuity that george created

1668976 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1668977 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1668978 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1668979 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1668980 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1668981 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1668982 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1668983 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1668984 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it

1668992 we are right now in the studio in europe and we are producing our third record so i think there are some surprises
1668993 ive always have my laptop with me and a pen
1668994 i think it would be so cool to meet rihanna
1668995 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1668996 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1668997 we did this record on our own paid for it ourselves with no expectations of what was going to happen with it if it was even going to be finished let alone released
1668998 i still see myself as more of a music fan than a professional musician
1668999 to get to play with wilco as a wilco fan
1669000 i mean were not wilcos peers at all you know
1669001 that kind of vocal based music is what ive most listened to since i was a tot i mean ive gone through periods of writing that werent as harmony based but just in terms of recording this lp the process kind of determined what the band is almost we were just laying down all these ideas straight to tape some songs never having played live and we just determined it made sense to have the whole record come from this same place and have a lot of similar singing things going on
1669002 scarves of red tied round their throats to keep their little heads from falling in the snow
1669003 to me one of the pitfalls of revivalism is that youre speaking outside your own experience
1669004 and we get inspiration from everywhere but we are mindful of expressing ourselves and our own ideas some people may interpret it as old or new but its just coming from us
1669005 ive found that if i tried to write something specifically new sounding it somehow diluted what i was doing if you are not the lucky dude with the right sensibility that youre totally brand new and everyone hears it as new then the best thing to do ive found is to write songs you think are ok and not really worry about sounding old or new
1669006 but i really feel like this current group of people feels like the creative beings that should be doing this ive never been part of a creative synergy thats this strong ever
1669007 casey and i are both wearing keys that go into the death switch
1669008 yeah its the kill switch for robin so when its that time its like its over
1669009 it was the second floor and it was really crazy we were like oh hi but she was so sweet she was very nervous

1669028 to come behind a 1 record and have a person whos currently relevant in dream one of the better songwriters to come through this industry and then do the jamie foxx thing the boss of all bosses i wanted to try something differently than i did on my last album
1669029 even my third single 1 fan with keyshia cole and j holiday
1669030 i wanted to load up two big features on that record as well try something different a lot of times you get a feature and its just you and that other artist i wanted to see if i could bring something different to the game see if i can force people to follow my trend
1669031 i used to give a f now i give a f less what do i think of success it sucks

1669034 back in the days when i was a teenager before i had status and before i had a pager you could find the abstract listening to hip hop my pops used to say it reminded him of bebop
1669035 so jet to the store and buy the lp on j i v e unfortunately
1669036 its a song that weve been performing all summer long
1669037 itll be different because were doing it at an awards show in front of all the celebrities you grew up watching but at the same time were doing our thing
1669038 i think the jonas brothers are really sexy in america
1669039 we just heard that and all we can say is thank you
1669040 i mean this is a first year for a lot of things for us
1669041 got the news today the doctor said i had to stay a little bit longer and ill be fine
1669042 weve been looking into scheduling when we can do that because weve been busy with touring but we would love to the success from the first one we did not expect that at all and the possibility of a second movie would be great
1669043 a lot of the disney people have talked about a sequel and ive heard rumors about scripts and stuff i would really like a love interest

1669046 whatever goes as long as youre not bothering anyone else just do what you want to do
1669047 now we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate
1669048 it was nothing out of the ordinary for a big show
1669049 the demoted intelligence chiefs may have met and decided on revenge
1669050 the assassination of suleiman mughniyeh and the defection of general ali al asgari sends a very strong message first and foremost to hezbollah and then to its allies in iran and syria that their activities and relations with hezbollah in lebanon are being watched
1669051 it also says that the ranks of their intelligence organisations have most probably been infiltrated and that a renewed conflict initiated by them would not be in their best interest at least militarily
1669052 my nose was broken in about ten place and i fractured my cheek bone and i sprained my neck
1669053 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
1669054 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
1669055 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
1669056 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
1669057 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
1669058 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
1669059 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
1669060 dude like i went over the falls and totally pearled
1669061 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
1669062 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
1669063 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1669064 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1669065 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1669066 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1669067 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1669068 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1669069 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1669070 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1669071 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1669072 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1669073 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1669074 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1669075 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1669076 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1669077 were seeking to ascertain whether it was a militant attack or firing by pakistani soldiers

1669080 our deadline has already expired but again we wanted to give a final deadline to the government to stop the operation or face the consequences
1669081 a large number of women have been approaching us for the past few years and consistently wishing to be given an opportunity to sacrifice their lives for a noble cause

1669123 with the politics of energy shifting as rapidly as gasoline prices democrats led by presidential candidate barack obama are retreating from long held positions and scrambling to offer distressed voters more immediate relief from spiraling costs
1669124 sen barack obama altered his position on monday to call for tapping the nations strategic petroleum reserve to lower gasoline prices as he outlined an energy plan that contrasts with sen john mccains greater emphasis on expanded offshore drilling and coal and nuclear technology
1669125 sen barack obama called monday for using oil from the nations strategic reserves to lower gasoline prices the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues as he and sen john mccain seek to find solutions to a topic that is increasingly dominating the presidential race
1669126 includes two significant reversals of positions he has taken in the past he had steadfastly fought the idea of limited new offshore drilling and was against tapping the nations emergency oil stockpile to relieve pump prices that have stubbornly hovered around 4 a gallon
1669127 sen barack obamas energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand

1669148 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1669149 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work
1669150 oh i want to drill but what can i do when the house speaker wont let me im just a poor wittle helpless democwat its a deliberate strategy and lie to deceive you

1669185 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1669186 its a bit opportunistic because all the mining shares have been so battered in the last six weeks or so
1669187 obviously xstrata has taken advantage of market weakness mining shares have got so ridiculously cheap i suppose its not impossible there will be bids for others
1669188 we find it difficult to see any other bidders coming out of the woodwork for lonmin so unless shareholders reject the deal we believe it is likely to go ahead

1669312 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1669313 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1669314 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1669315 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1669316 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow

1669323 having been in the job for four or five years now a lot of what he said resonated with me it was sad to see a man of his stature go
1669324 i think that weve seen all the build up to kp and itll be interesting to see how he handles the job over a period of time the england captaincy is an important voice in world cricket and michael always handled himself very well
1669325 he pietersen has certainly going to have to be a lot more aware of the things he does and what he says youve got to give him the chance to do that its not my job to judge him now

1669391 the number of dial up homes ripe for migration to broadband is rapidly dwindling there are barely a million of them left now and they are an increasingly resistant minority

1669533 today marks another important step forward for the executive we have said since the restoration of devolution that we would make victims and survivors a priority for this administration
1669534 we have recently announced interim funding arrangements for work with victims and survivors during this year the outline strategy proposes the way ahead in the longer term
1669535 there is no issue more sensitive or difficult to deal with for the executive than that of how to address the needs of victims and survivors
1669536 we hope that this document will help to move us on the road to making a real difference to the lives of those who have been most affected by the events here over the last 40 years
1669537 the executive set aside 36m to meet the needs of victims and survivors over the next three years
1669538 however we want to ensure that future support and services are shaped by victims and survivors it is important that everyone with an interest in victims and survivors issues read this draft document carefully and gives us their views
1669539 this outline strategy will set a clear direction for policy in this area over the next 10 years
1669540 through the executive we have the opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of those affected by conflict

1669543 quite a number of assembly members are abroad on holiday or are on leave at the minute and we would have to consider whether it would be justified bringing back from holidays at public expense mlas from various parts of the world and what benefit that would actually have

1669547 this survey highlights that some sectors of the housing market are experiencing appreciable rates of price decline though the overall picture when balanced out suggests that there has only been a 4 reduction
1669548 but the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1669549 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1669550 the survey shows that price changes vary widely across different parts of northern ireland and across the types of properties so people should be cautious about making over simplistic judgments
1669551 for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1669552 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely turn before prices do but it might be a while

1669556 if middle school students are having a bad day it totally throws off their test scores
1669557 the state should pay more attention to the middle school level
1669558 often middle school is a critical transition for students from the more protective environment of an elementary school to the more complex social and academic challenges of a secondary school
1669559 i dont like to play games i just like to learn i need to improve in math and english
1669560 there has been longstanding confusion of what the focus of middle schools should be
1669561 if we want to compete with the rest of world and if we want kids to succeed they need to learn at high levels and having these few years of hitting the pause button has been disastrous
1669562 kids at this age need a lot of structure and unconditional love and people to be tough on them
1669563 you cant go after kids with extra mcas help all the time

1669575 there are thousands of conduits to customer data security isnt working and tjx is the poster child of a big data breach
1669576 what is needed is a different approach to secure that data far more directly where it lives
1669577 we instituted significant system upgrades and we are continuously employing measures to help protect data against the ever increasing sophistication of thieves

1669599 i think that back in the 60s and 70s a lot of the way we regulated industry was top down command and control
1669600 and i think that the republican party and people who thought about the markets came with the notion that you know what if you simply set some guidelines some rules and incentives for businesses let them figure out how theyre going to for example reduce pollution
1669601 it was natural for me to be interested in international affairs

1669612 i said he needed to realize that its the non south african companies who were hiring blacks and giving them positions of authority with decent pay thats what accelerates change not isolation
1669613 he always seemed aloof a little bit of a stray cat
1669614 i remember telling him he was making a big mistake
1669615 he let me know he had bigger fish to fry
1669616 he believed in markets and he believed in competition but he didnt believe the market was a level playing field

1669651 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1669652 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1669653 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1669654 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1669655 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1669656 the olympic tournament doesnt feature in the official fifa calendar and there is no executive decision by fifa which establishes a right of release for under 23 players for this tournament
1669657 consequently schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona are not obliged to release the players rafinha diego and messi

1669683 yo llegu a corinto en junio del a o pasado iba como un comerciante de productos agr colas alquil un cuarto y durante las primeras semanas me dediqu a visitar los vendedores tradicionales en ese y otros pueblos cercanos los primeros d as sent mucho miedo porque la gente lo mira a uno raro y me daba cuenta de que hab a milicianos de las farc que me segu an para ver qu hac a yo con qui n me reun a o con qui n hablaba
1669684 los viernes son los d as de mercado y es el d a en que todo el mundo est en el pueblo bebiendo o donde las putas
1669685 al comienzo me sentaba solo en una tienda con el paso del tiempo de verme tanto la gente empez a conversar conmigo
1669686 era una persona a la que le gustaba el trago durante varias semanas le fui haciendo la charla y como no ten a plata para tomar o ir donde la putas yo lo invitaba
1669687 un viernes cuando el guerrillero baj est bamos en un bar y l se sent con nosotros ese d a se arm una pelea de borrachos lleg la polic a y nos arrest a todos nos dejaron 24 horas en el calabozo
1669688 la primera vez hab a unos 30 guerrilleros a m me dio un susto el berraco y no dejaba de pensar en lo que le hab a pasado a mi capit n guerrero me toc hacer de tripas coraz n y por fortuna el guerrillero me present con sus compa eros como un buen amigo que les ayudaba a l y su familia
1669689 ten a las g evas en el cuello ese d a
1669690 lo primero que hicimos fue ganarnos la confianza del due o del cami n despu s comenzamos a ofrecerle precios m s favorables que los del sitio habitual donde l compraba
1669691 alquil una casa en el pueblo cerca de donde viv a el due o del cami n sal amos de parranda juntos y and bamos para arriba y para abajo todo el tiempo
1669692 aunque hab amos hablado de la guerrilla y yo me hab a mostrado muy af n con su lucha l no me hab a comentado qu parte de los v veres que nosotros ten amos en el almac n era para la guerrilla
1669693 lo convenc de que yo ten a que ir con l a hacer las entregas porque las cuentas no cuadraban como yo era el socio capitalista le toc aceptar en los primeros viajes nunca hicimos entregas a la guerrilla bamos a veredas o a cualquier otro lugar pero como l era el proveedor principal de ese frente era cuesti n de tiempo para que se les acabaran las cosas y nos tocara ir
1669694 un d a me invit a tomar trago y me cont que les llevaba v veres y otras cosas a los guerrilleros obviamente dije que no le ve a problema a eso
1669695 la primera vez que me llev los tipos guerrilleros estaban muy prevenidos y bravos con el due o del cami n yo me asust mucho porque esa vez me requisaron y hasta me hicieron empelotar aunque yo no ten a ning n equipo encima me preocupaba que hicieran lo mismo con el cami n y descubrieran las c maras
1669696 yo me sentaba con ellos a tomar cerveza y a hablar carreta mientras descargaban el cami n una vez me dijeron que si quer a disparar un fusil de ellos me toc dejar que el fusil me pegara en la cara para mantener la fachada de que no ten a idea de armas me qued un morado y ellos estaban muertos de la risa
1669697 al comienzo me encontraba con ella cuando la dejaban ir al pueblo y hac amos todo lo que hacen los novios
1669698 el 24 yo le hab a dicho a jurga jurga que ten a que ir hasta el almac n a arauquita para hacer unas cosas pero no me dio permiso de salir del campamento yo no ten a c mo informarles a mis compa eros que yo todav a estaba ah yo no sab a c mo iba a ser el ataque y alcanc a pensar que mis propios compa eros me iban a bombardear

1669910 i have little or no faith in what the fbi does as far as investigating and arresting somebody

1669931 the new units are quiet smaller for travel and easy to use most importantly the new technology allows us to identify and correct possible problems at the start of the treatment even experienced cpap patients admit to some difficulties when they first started cpap previously specific problems could not be identified and many patients struggled or just gave up now we have more choices of mask types and designs which may be a better fit and more comfortable for different individuals
1669932 we have a program to call patients and follow up on cpap use and tracking data patients seem happily surprised when we call and ask if they have questions or problems additionally we have on site daily cpap clinics for new and experienced cpap patients to talk with staff about their progress and to see new masks and equipment patients bring in their masks and other equipment for retraining refitting of masks or equipment adjustments a few minor changes can make a world of difference in making cpap comfortable and easier to use

1669942 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1669943 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission

1669959 la steaua il club pi prestigioso di romania e far di tutto per dimostrarmi alla sua altezza
1669960 e stata una prestazione veramente deludente ha affermato smith sembra imposibile che si possa raggiungere una finale europea e poi uscire di scena alla prima partita della stagione successiva invece proprio quello che accaduto
1669961 la gloria e la credibilit acquisite lanno scorso con lapprodo alla finale di coppa uefa si sono dissolte insieme ai 12 5 mlioni di euro previsti per la qualificazione alla fase a gironi
1669962 non so se i giocatori fossero ansiosi o nervosi ma in ogni caso non ci esistono scuse
1669963 senza dubbio fu la mia serata peggiore dal punto di vista calcistico non ci sono aggettivi per descrivere la mia delusione
1669964 non avevo dubbi sulla nostra possibilit di battere i rangers ha dichiarato tutti i giocatori credevano nella vittoria
1669965 se incontrassimo di nuovo i rangers saremmo favoriti ha dichiarato lex allenatore dellfc porto abbiamo lavorato sodo nelle recenti settimane e abbiamo meritato questa vittoria non abbiamo attaccato per utto il tempo sarebbe stato troppo rischioso abbiamo dovuto neutralizzare larma pi pericolosa dei nostri avversari il contropiede
1669966 il kaunas stato superiore ai rangers dal punto di vista tattico ha affermato nella ripresa gli scozzesi hanno pensato troppo a difendersi
1669967 sabato parto per la danimarca e assister ad una partita dellaalborg in campionato
1669968 molti ritengono che nel terzo turno avremo un compito pi facile ma io non la penso cos attualmente laalborg pi in forma dei rangers
1669969 lultima volta che sono stato qui giocavo con il losanna e vincemmo 2 1 sarei felice di ripetere quellimpresa ha dichiarato siamo pronti per scendere in campo giocheremo in un grande stadio contro un avversario difficile e un pubblico numeroso crediamo nei nostri mezzi e non cambieremo le nostre abitudini
1669970 la partita della settimana scorsa stata equilibrata anche se abbiamo giocato leggermente meglio ha dichiarato credo che questa sera dovremo puntare maggiormente sul contropiede ma non sar un problema per noi
1669971 e tutto bellissimo ha affermato pensando alla trasferta di basilea era il nostro obbiettivo e ho delle sensazioni molto positive
1669972 ritengo che la scorsa settimana il basilea ci sia stato inferiore ma stasera sar divers ha affermato dovremmo essere pronti a prevedere le loro mosse sarebbe ovviamente fantastico se riuscissimo a segnare nei primi minuti possiamo farlo se giochiamo come sappiamo
1669973 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1669974 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1669975 for the attention of ms sarah carey operator of gubu blog
1669976 they made some inquires and then brought in the police dog the dog started tracking over several yards and fences before coming to a residence in the 5100 block of 27 avenue
1669977 it turns out the man had been arrested for mischief earlier in the year and was under probation he was under curfew and was supposed to be in from 9 at night until 6 in the morning he was to keep the peace and be of good behaviour he was arrested and taken back to jail
1669978 she was treated by police and bc ambulance and transported to clearwater hospital the victims son was arrested and taken into custody
1669979 at this point there is nothing to indicate that drugs or alcohol were factors we know that the woman and her son both lived at the same house but we dont know what caused this incident
1669980 the woman is of course unable to give us a statement at this point and her son is exercising his right to remain silent he has spoken with legal counsel but not with the police yet
1669981 the dog sustained considerable injury and had to be put down
1669982 we also heard that people were concerned about chlorine levels in the air so council took action and the community jumped in to help out this is a great example of people and organizations coming together to make something happen which will benefit the entire community
1669983 while many attribute these symptoms to chlorine itself they are actually due to chlorination by products that occur when chlorine combines with sweat cosmetics and other substances present on swimmers bodies
1669984 crews have been working really hard around the clock to get it controlled we are now in the mop up stages but that could take at least a couple of days
1669985 if i could own one vehicle this would be it
1669986 i went up to her and told her that i was concerned because it was very dark i asked her to leave or i would call her a cab i was uncomfortable with her being there sitting on the roadside
1669987 its reflective of the fact that more investigative work needs to be done
1669988 there were no reported ejections or arrests made as a result of the event
1669989 this appeared to be successful in moving individuals away from the local nightclubs during the bar flush there were a few infractions over the course of the weekend however we are pleased with the overall turnaround and the cooperation of those drivers
1669990 this individual became irate and threatened hotel staff while demanding cash back officers located the suspect in the parking lot and when they attempted to arrest him he became combative and attempted to swallow several baggies believed to contain cocaine during the arrest the suspect attempted to bite an officer twice
1669991 extending terms to four years might suit some communities but im not sure it would suit kelowna kelowna is a changing community going through lots of development the demand for infrastructure is never ending
1669992 i believe a three year term is a good balance it gives us the best of both worlds
1669993 having been a new councillor last year knowing it takes a year to really get up to speed my personal opinion is that a four year term makes more sense there is just so much to learn in the first year then there is just about one year to do the work and then in the third year its like election fever kicks in and everyone goes into election mode
1669994 im happy with whatever is decided its certainly a good topic to discuss there is a financial benefit for a community to have elections every four years instead of three but thats also longer for people to commit their time
1669995 its being totally rebuilt the reason its brown now is because were not irrigating it
1669996 its going to be completely rebuilt and reconfigured as a result of the bridge approach
1669997 with a natural grass field it takes time before you can put people on it we usually like to allow a full season of growing before putting people on it so the field probably wont open until the spring of 2010
