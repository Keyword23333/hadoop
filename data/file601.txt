6010132 we would fix the passenger fares in a day or two after the atf price revision

6010203 the lord is far from the wicked but he hears the prayer of the righteous
6010204 if anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away as a branch and dries up and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
6010205 and whatever we ask we receive from him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
6010206 whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple
6010207 let it be done to me according to your word
6010208 about gold its a dream to keep chasing its a dream to keep you going its a dream that sometimes gets put on hold gold is never a given
6010209 gold is not into predictions its not into how many youre meant to take home it could be one it could be two or three it could be none predictions mean nothing gold is never a given
6010210 gold can be lost in a flash lost in the blink of an eye lost before the start of the race lost months before you step onto the track gold is never a given
6010211 old enough to know better young enough not to stop
6010212 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6010213 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6010214 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6010215 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6010216 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6010217 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6010218 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6010219 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6010220 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6010221 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6010222 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6010223 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6010224 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6010225 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6010226 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6010227 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6010228 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6010229 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6010230 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6010231 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6010232 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6010233 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6010234 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6010235 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6010236 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6010237 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6010238 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6010239 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6010240 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6010241 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6010242 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6010243 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6010244 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6010245 how can you drive your car like this your shock absorbers are gone
6010246 come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
6010247 these things i have spoken to you that in me you may have peace in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
6010248 he will keep in perfect peace all those who trust in him whose thoughts turn often to the lord
6010249 the lord himself will give you a sign behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son
6010250 you bethlehem though you are little among the thousands of judah yet out of you shall come forth to me the one to be ruler in israel whose goings forth are from of old from everlasting
6010251 go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me
6010252 then i said to them if it is agreeable to you give me my wages and if not refrain
6010253 then judas which had betrayed him jesus when he saw that he was condemned repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders
6010254 cast to the potter in the house of the lord
6010255 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken
6010256 will ye therefore that i release unto you from prison the king of the jews then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas
6010257 i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it has melted within me dogs have surrounded me the congregation of the wicked has enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet they divide my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots
6010258 i am poured out like water my heart is melted within me
6010259 dogs have surrounded me the congregation of the wicked has enclosed me
6010260 they divide my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots
6010261 then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to each soldier a part and also the tunic
6010262 and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death
6010263 for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption psalm16 10 the word
6010264 his soul was not left in hell or the grave neither did his flesh see corruption
6010265 he is not here but is risen why seek ye the living among the dead luke 24 6 5
6010266 at the end of 62 sevens shall the messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the ruler that shall come shall destroy the city of jerusalem and the sanctuary the jewish temple
6010267 then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary the one facing toward the east and it was shut
6010268 the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east
6010269 it shall be shut because the lord jesus the god of israel has entered in by it
6010270 what have you to do with me jesus son of the most high god i beg you do not torment me
6010271 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me john 14 6
6010272 i am the resurrection and the life the person who believes in me even though he dies will live john 11 25
6010273 i am the living bread that came down out of heaven if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever and the bread also which i will give for the life of the world is my flesh john 6 51
6010274 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will not hunger and he who believes in me will never thirst john 6 35
6010275 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
6010276 i am the good shepherd and i know my own and my own know me john 10 14
6010277 my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would be fighting so that i would not be handed over to the jews but as it is my kingdom is not of this realm john 18 36

6010280 under current regulations nara does not require agencies to maintain records in their native formats so for now many agencies still print e mail messages and file the paper versions although the filing process is relatively easy the practice has a major weakness it eliminates the searchability of digital documents
6010281 breaking through writers block every business letter and template youll ever need for a thriving professional services practice
6010282 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6010283 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now

6010287 ahora estamos donde quer amos estar en una semifinales ol mpicas
6010288 en este tipo de partidos que van a hacer intensos y duros y contra rivales de nivel hay que estar defensivamente al tope desde el primer momento
6010289 est bamos bastante con m s desconfianza en ese partido pero ya poco a poco ganamos el partido de angola 98 50 y con la victoria contra croacia nos estamos reci n recuperando
6010290 nada es imposible y si tenemos una nueva oportunidad daremos lo mejor de nosotros
6010291 en un nivel un poquit n inferior a la defensa
6010292 por las precipitaciones que ha habido cuando ya ten amos una ventaja amplia no hemos sabido mantener la misma seriedad anterior en el ataque pero la defensa pr cticamente hasta el final

6010296 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

6010300 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6010301 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6010302 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6010303 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6010304 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6010305 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6010306 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6010307 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6010308 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6010309 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6010310 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6010311 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6010312 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6010313 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day

6010315 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6010316 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6010317 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6010318 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6010319 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6010320 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6010321 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6010322 many in the christian right tend to get their information

6010327 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6010328 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6010329 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6010330 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6010331 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6010332 the cost of capital of this nature is just staggering
6010333 they will want as much assurance as they can possibly get

6010353 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
6010354 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout

6010356 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6010357 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah

6010359 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6010360 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6010361 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6010362 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6010363 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

6010371 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6010372 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6010373 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6010374 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

6010386 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6010387 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6010388 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6010389 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen

6010394 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6010395 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6010410 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past

6010413 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6010414 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6010415 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6010416 the market has been pacing up and down at low levels for a long time investors have all been waiting for a chance
6010417 the market should rebound but i dont think it means a return to a bull market in just one day since there arent any actual policies being announced
6010418 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6010419 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6010420 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6010421 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6010422 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6010423 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6010424 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6010425 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
6010426 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
6010427 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
6010428 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6010429 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6010430 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6010431 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6010432 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6010433 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6010434 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6010435 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6010436 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6010437 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6010438 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6010439 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6010440 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6010441 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6010442 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6010443 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6010444 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6010445 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6010446 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6010447 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6010448 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6010449 l nder wie deutschland w rden als domizill nder wieder attraktiv werden

6010451 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6010452 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6010453 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6010454 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6010455 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6010456 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6010457 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6010458 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6010459 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6010460 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6010461 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
6010462 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
6010463 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
6010464 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

6010466 programming in parallel is simply too complex for the average code writer who has been trained in a very linear fashion
6010467 whoever figures out how to take advantage of multicore first could wreak some serious economic damage on their competition
6010468 rising costs for energy and a variety of other products
6010469 steep slump in housing rising unemployment and a severe credit crisis have worked to offset 92 billion in economic stimulus payments
6010470 rising over the past 12 months by 9 8 percent
6010471 housing slump in decades was showing no signs of a rebound

6010475 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6010476 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6010477 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6010478 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6010479 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6010480 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6010481 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6010482 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6010483 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6010484 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6010485 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6010486 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6010487 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6010488 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6010489 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6010490 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6010491 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6010492 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6010493 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
6010494 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
6010495 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
6010496 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
6010497 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
6010498 we know that consumers dont want to pull out and set up a second keyboard for a gaming session so we created a device that was perfect for both gaming and regular computer use

6010500 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6010501 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6010502 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6010503 im so impressed with the work that youre doing and the information youre disseminating its just vital for people to get this sort of information
6010504 mike adams has one of the best websites on the internet his articles podcasts and books will improve your life and possibly save it
6010505 the last two days have been very useful to us and weve gathered a lot of data
6010506 this track is quite grippy so its difficult to see exactly where this puts us with regards to some of the other circuits but i am confident that weve made many forward steps we now need to spend time reviewing the data to assess fully everything weve evaluated in the last two days

6010512 we believe management wants to leave its mortgage troubles behind and restore confidence
6010513 it was clear early on that a solution would be needed very quickly and the administrators of the langholm dyeing company took a very positive response
6010514 the company got into difficulty originally not because it was not a viable business but because it was a victim of the global credit crunch and had american backers
6010515 i always said if i could be this much like my mom id be proud
6010516 she was the most amazing mother wife grandmother person i knew
6010517 before especially with her heart she was in pretty good shape
6010518 and then having to get up and leave your house at four in the morning in nothing but your pjs she didnt do so well from that point on
6010519 whatever it was this whole mess triggered it we have no doubt
6010520 due to the impressive performance of the british olympic team we expect there will be a significant increase in requests for olympic related sites over the next six days and we predict that this will take its toll on companies bandwidth
6010521 if companies do not have sufficient bandwidth then a number of problems can occur including business interruption and a slowdown in performance to critical business lan applications as well as serious cost implications
6010522 employees that are not taking part in this olympic web surfing may find that their access to legitimate business sites is delayed due to the pressure on the companys bandwidth importantly this could have an impact on the companys bottom line
6010523 sunrises business has increased to the point where the existing original storage of 4 000 uswg is not sufficient to operate the business economically
6010524 from an engineering point of view from the documentation submitted obviously the indication was they had met the requirements
6010525 but thats not meaning theyve done everything until there is a physical inspection we dont just rely on paperwork
6010526 there was a critical and crucial step yet to go
6010527 currently there are numerous investigations into the incident and sunrise is co operating fully with the authorities
6010528 however out of an abundance of caution and a desire for the investigatory process to unfold free of speculation and misinformation we will not be making any further public comments at this time
6010529 we appreciate that this has been a difficult period for all affected and while we understand the publics desire for immediate answers we believe that only in the fullness of time will the answers be found

6010575 cuba is importing about 85 percent of the food that we need
6010576 this is incredible because in the past cuba was an important exporter of food
6010577 the main reason we dont have cuban customers is because they cant afford the prices
6010578 and i think opportunities should come we have to be patient i have bet on cuba and on the future of cuba and thats why im here we are simply waiting
6010579 i can see the peaks i can see trees im surrounded by beauty
6010580 its where i wanted to raise my children its safe and ever since ive been back home its been very difficult to find a place to live
6010581 i was aware it was much more expensive but i was a little deer caught in headlights when we actually moved there
6010582 i wasnt joking when i said well to even enter the real estate market here in flagstaff i would need to be paid twice what i was getting about 100 000
6010583 the key is if we do good architecture beautiful homes that are still affordable you can have something that would be an example demonstration to the community of whats possible
6010584 youd be lucky to get an apartment thats been remodeled and called a townhome
6010585 but im happy with what ive bought but who knows if ill ever be able to move anywhere near flag
6010586 as the very prime places become unaffordable to anybody but the very rich
6010587 people start saying well whats the next prettiest place where do we get the next prettiest view or whats the next prettiest lake that we can afford
6010588 so there is a constant sort of sprawl if you will going on in many of these areas
6010589 when we moved here and had friends come out with us they just thought we were out of our heads
6010590 downtown was largely abandoned and like a lot of these route 66 towns it had been turned over to drunk bars so at 1 oclock at night it was like night of the living dead
6010591 they closed the bars people staggered out there were fights in the streets intoxicated street people everywhere
6010592 i think most americans are kind of groundless because we move all the time were not attached to a place and theres something really compelling about this particular place and its become our home

6010606 brothers if someone is caught in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently but watch yourself or you also may be tempted carry each others burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself each one should test his own actions then he can take pride in himself without comparing himself to somebody else for each one should carry his own load anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor

6010740 the need for an increased effort in plasma physics research and for more trained plasma physicists is driven by the expanding use of plasmas in a wide range of applications in industry including the effort to determine if laser produced nuclear fusion can provide for the worlds post oil power needs

6010742 highlighting these two new systems to our international research colleagues will ensure queens centre for plasma physics and its researchers remain to the fore of global breakthroughs in the area of high energy density physics we are anticipating many new international collaborations
6010743 given the fragility of african agriculture and perpetual famine risks with millions of lives at stake msv is actually one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide
6010744 we wanted to learn more about how the virus emerged and spread so we can develop new ways to fight the diseases it causes
6010745 we found that the maize adapted virus infects a greater variety of grasses than any of the other msv strains
6010746 the virus appears to be spreading around africa faster than the other strains too when we compared the genomes of 11 different strains of msv we discovered that lots of genes had been exchanged between the strains in a process called recombination we also found that every msv that causes severe disease in maize has descended from an ancestral virus that was the recombinant offspring of two relatively harmless wild grass infecting viruses this chance recombination event could be the reason msv has become such a serious problem
6010747 understanding the chain of events that trigger the emergence of novel pathogens is a major goal of epidemiologists worldwide
6010748 there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting how evolutionary processes like recombination might trigger the emergence of a pathogen but there are actually very few well documented examples of this having occurred
6010749 knowing that maize adapted msvs are unusually mobile i hope will prompt scientists to test msv resistance genes against the large bank of virus strains that we have catalogued from across africa
6010750 we are currently testing various resistance strategies some in an advanced stage of development using many of the viruses weve sampled complex genetic strategies like stacking resistance genes and targeting different virus components that cannot be simultaneously exchanged by recombination might ultimately be the only way to control the disease
6010751 so far a lot of experiments have been carried out with optical techniques that are sometimes difficult to integrate in a complete system the new nanostructures we envisage will make it possible for us to miniaturize systems even further and to develop commercially feasible equipment
6010752 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6010753 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
6010754 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
6010755 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6010756 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6010757 we are proud to re introduce ourselves with our newly changed look we assume that this transition will strengthen our relationship with online travelers who approach us for our reliable services on regular basis we believe this transformation will also raise our level of service in online travel industry

6010762 we must leave here two soldiers are dead and if they know you live
6010763 you can mourn for him later and i will help you call an olgress so he can pass the judgment i will help you but we must leave here now
6010764 you are a brave man like in the singers songs i prayed they would not kill you and they did not
6010765 some are men some are what men would call gods i and my family serve them and they help us they can walk with the dead beyond the life of the living
6010766 ill have the rabbit ready soon you need to eat so you can be strong
6010767 i had to care for him so he would not spoil he is a beautiful boy you and your wife must have been proud
6010768 she left me with the baby not long after he was born she was just a child herself i do not blame her

6010770 my people say the giants had once chased their smallest and weakest south from these mountains they were the unwanted half men or hu mans in their ancient tongue the people of keehl bon were known as the unwanted by our historians
6010771 i thought as much you are taller and well taller than our woman
6010772 taller yes to you but i am of average height to those in tikor our men and woman use to be much taller if there is any truth to our legends our history says they put woman who were fit to breed in the far north my greatest grandmother would have been one of these to be sure your kind would not return and spoil woman the greatest giants of old had pushed the southern lands down they even placed guards atop these cliffs to throw down rock and ice if the hu mans ever came too close the larger giants are still said to thunder above the clouds in jealousy
6010773 oh yes the unwanted were mad at being driven out away from the most beautiful so they created great ships and sailed around this wall and they found us woman
6010774 it was said that the unwanted were not always chased out for being weaker but for being charmers in truth as the stories go the unwanted won the favor of our woman and these woman spurned the great giants the giants hearts were broken and they cry tiers that are the rain to this day
6010775 no your stories are good we have nothing like that oh we have alphatha and ansel the seer how he overthrew the keehl and started a new nation but nothing like what you just told me we have childrens stories of giants and drago

6010778 i was talking to the boy comforting him it must seem unnatural to you i know but it is my gift he is afraid philip alphatha guards the place of rest and roland is afraid to meet him we must help him soon
6010779 it is time to call the olgress he can shepherd him past alphatha
6010780 i will need blood to call it and i do not wish it to hurt more than necessary
6010781 just a cut on my palm so the blood will flow
6010782 when the moon is highest we will call the olgress

6010785 now philip and when you are done i will take the knife and hand you this shell catch your lifeblood into the shell it will not bleed long
6010786 they told me of you and i offered to come
6010787 alphatha has held us in bonds for too long i wanted to serve i want to show you that you can be so much more than you believe one last drop philip and
6010788 i have helped you philip you will no longer be the weak man who couldnt save your son

6010860 we proberen een balans te zoeken waardoor mensen blijven kijken naar het programma dat was in het begin erg moeilijk de eerste aflevering van de eerste serie is misschien wel tien keer hergemonteerd
6010861 als ik eenmaal een klik heb durf ik alles te vragen
6010862 weve got various different ideas i think all the leads on the team all have their own idea what the demo should be and it obviously makes sense for the demo to happen before the game ships we all feel that its essential because the game is so different
6010863 there were four challenges in the e3 demo in banjo land and that worked well so the idea would be that and then wed have some form of the editor in there as well because thats a whole different part of the game building things and seeing how they perform and taking part in challenges
6010864 the way stop n swop was meant to work originally was that theres parts in the original banjo that werent unlocked until the original banjo realised youd been playing the sequel which we had to change because of the evolution of the hardware of the n64 it wouldve worked on early n64s but not the later ones
6010865 so thats why we never actually released it it was my job to actually finish it off so you cant imagine how many fans hate me because of that so what were doing now is literally the same thing so there is unlockables in both games that are accessible once both games realise youve been playing the other one
6010866 no that in turn unlocks bits that you can use and so forth i think thats about as far as im allowed to go

6010870 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think
6010871 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
6010872 but we think in three to four years time although there are good reasons why it should be 2010 already but well see
6010873 i think theres just too much that we dont know about videogames that its hard to say oh youre doing that because guess what this world in its own right in any right is huge
6010874 its honestly hard to judge a world that you dont know i think for hollywood and for the acting world i was sort of like oh my gosh whats this going to mean to me if im going to do a videogame i sort of thought about it for a while
6010875 everyone ive mentioned it to honestly actors directors producers people ive worked with
6010876 i think theres still snobbery i think theres still a massive misunderstanding about what the work actually is
6010877 i understand that unfortunately the internet seems to be a haven for people who like to just get out there and throw out the most vitriolic and aggressive stance they can but there are no secret piles of money that the companys somehow magically making
6010878 i havent been paid in almost two months and ive been putting money out to try and get people taken care of thats the flip side
6010879 it probably goes against popular belief but just because we all used to work at blizzard doesnt mean that were all millionaires although that sure would have been great
6010880 as anybody could tell you during the last days of flagship i was pretty much a wreck
6010881 hellgate came out and it wasnt as good as it should have been theres a myriad of reasons for that some of them were just bad timing in the pc market the pc market was lousy last year
6010882 some of it was the fact that we were an independent studio we didnt have unlimited money and we had to ship when we had to ship part of it was because we overreached and that was a design problem that was totally our fault we tried to do too much
6010883 we tried to be a standalone game and a free play game and an mmo and an rpg and a shooter we were trying to be something for everybody and ended up really not pleasing many people at all i think we should have picked one or the other
6010884 the challenge they face is like if somebody says hey i made you a loan against your ferrari and now the loans due so i want the ferrari and i say great heres a box of parts because i didnt actually finish building the car yet
6010885 so they have it but its not done and they dont have any of the engineers that were there that know how to build the game or use the tools or use the tech or anything
6010886 do i think people are going to be critical well people already have people were critical about the game before theyd even played it so i dont think thats necessarily going to change
6010887 i think if people see the game for what it is and review the game for what it is then itll get a good reception
6010888 its a solid game weve made a lot of games we stand behind it and we wouldnt release a game until its ready so we feel really good about that
6010889 i think the reception of the demo speaks for itself
6010890 are there people who dont like it well no one likes every game but in the end if were going to worry about critical reviews then were in the wrong industry
6010891 what i and i think people at silicon knights are more concerned with are when people play the game are they having a fun time and do they feel theyre being entertained and thats all that matters

6011492 are our leaders really worried about what is happening in czechoslovakia
6011493 i think they are not only worried they are frightened not because it is a threat to socialist development or to the security of the warsaw pact countries but because the events in czechoslovakia might undermine the authority of the leaders of these countries and discredit the very principles and methods of leadership that prevail in the socialist camp today
6011494 each of us on their own decided to do this because it has become impossible to live and breathe

6011527 er is een oud gedicht een chinees gedicht geloof ik over een man die droomt dat hij een vlinder is als hij wakker wordt vraagt hij zich af hoe het zit droomde hij nou echt dat hij een vlinder was of is hij in werkelijkheid juist een vlinder die op dit moment droomt dat hij een man is

6011529 fue importante la concurrencia como la calidad del evento los disertantes las muestras que se han tra do y la regi n que se ha abarcado con la presencia de un par de bodegas de c rdoba que trajeron sus productos mas la suma de las bodegas de la regi n de cuyo as que esta evinor en su segundo a o va marcando un camino

6011531 ik dacht bij mezelf dichters hebben oog voor verwondering zoals die ook bij kinderen leeft
6011532 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6011533 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
6011534 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
6011535 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
6011536 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
6011537 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
6011538 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris britney ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
6011539 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
6011540 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
6011541 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
6011542 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
6011543 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
6011544 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
6011545 hes starting a blistering tv campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism
6011546 now john you know that every time he tries to get tough he quickly runs out of gas sometimes in debates hed be exhausted by the third question he must use up all his energy in the gym he doesnt have any stamina and he certainly doesnt have our bloodlust besides you can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos
6011547 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me
6011548 that was inspired to snatch his convention away makes him look so weak listen why dont you stop in sedona on the way to denver wear a black wig and ill spirit you up to the cabin for the night ill catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you it will be an adventure
6011549 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6011550 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6011551 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6011552 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices

6011686 the human rights woman keeps coming to our house and taking pictures of my daughter my daughter has not been raped she just injured herself when she was out playing
6011687 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6011688 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6011689 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6011690 in 2005 poker was going gangbusters and everybody added rooms
6011691 a small supply of players got spread out between multiple rooms from our point of view bringing in the pokerpro tables gives us an opportunity to pique the interest of a different kind of player
6011692 the excalibur is a low end kind of room as far as stakes are concerned we think this product fits that group of players
6011693 announcing our first service to the middle east is the perfect follow up to our london heathrow service which began in march
6011694 who are we to judge people we never know what kind of road they followed to lead them to where they are now it might have been a broken poor amp bumpy road but at least they came home

6011698 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6011699 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6011700 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
6011701 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6011702 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6011703 we set the table for them and cracked it open further with an error and those guys capped it off with a hit we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6011704 weve been pitching well its just at the end we cracked the door for them and let them win
6011705 its frustrating because we didnt play well enough certainly in the eighth inning theres not much more you can say about it
6011706 nehalem will be the backbone of intel for years to come
6011707 higher performance and energy efficiency are not mutually exclusive if you innovate enough
6011708 when you go into performance versus energy there is a trade off argument we dont want to have that argument
6011709 we want to give you a race car that gives you the miles per gallon of an economy car
6011710 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
6011711 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
6011712 their overall story about the increasing graphics intensity running on our desktops i think thats absolutely true

6011721 obstacles that appear solid but completely tear away on impact may not be feasible doesnt it begin to turn the third leg into steeple chasing over brush fences with changes of direction added maybe thats ok
6011722 obstacles that were so packed in that together with the twists and turns and undulations as it snaked up and down the beas river golf course there was as ingrid klimke said
6011723 la oss b ye oss for gud og bekjenne v re synder
6011724 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6011725 the war which was triggered in georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6011726 era un poco como la ciudad de nueva york cuando entra en funcionamiento por la ma ana
6011727 uno corre una cortina y ah est esta ciudad reluciente llena de gente deseosa de gastar dinero en vino yo vine en marzo justo despu s del recorte y pens bueno aqu hay una oportunidad vamos a hacerlo ya
6011728 en realidad asegurar a que hong kong ya es el centro del comercio del vino en asia hasta el 23 de todo el vino que se vende en las subastas internacionales se vende a compradores de hong kong pero las consecuencias del recorte fiscal han sido dr sticas
6011729 en los primeros tres o cuatro d as confirmamos el env o de diez contenedores de vinos escasos y de calidad nos hab amos preparado abriendo un segundo almac n y ahora estamos abriendo un tercero para depositar los vinos que lleguen
6011730 de todos modos vas a tener que ir a china con toda su burocracia a m todo esto no me cuadra
6011731 eso est bien si importas 200 cajas de vino est ndar pero no si son seis botellas de lafite del 96 protesta deeb
6011732 la consecuencia es que el mercado del vino de calidad en la china continental no va a desarrollarse m s all del consumo
6011733 son grandes compradores de marcas clasificadas de latours y lafites pero no los conservan
6011734 este mercado consiste en exhibirse en salir con los amigos y decirles mirad tengo aqu un latour del 82 vamos a beb rnosla
6011735 esta charla que hicimos hoy de la mano de un en logo de la cooperativa la riojana conjuntamente con el rea de turismo del municipio de chilecito fue llevar adelante esta acci n de hablar del torront s riojano cepa emblem tica de la argentina y por ello es que invitamos esta noche de domingo a estos visitantes para que se interioricen un poco m s sobre este vino y m s teniendo en cuenta que no todos los d as se puede tener un contacto directo con un en logo que brinde detalles que a veces no se escribe en un folleto de promoci n esto es b sicamente trabajar en conjunto y brindarle un servicio m s al turista como lo es una charla en un horario particular y que les permita llevarse esa informaci n que no es habitual a sus lugares de or genes porque no hay mejor cosa que aparte de llevarse nuestros productos hagan el comentario boca a boca y que a partir del inter s del consumidor argentino de nuestros vinos genera una importante actividad tur stica
6011736 la riojana cooperativa viene trabajando y desarrollando proyectos que hacen a la actividad tur stica y obviamente el varietal torront s riojano es uno de los temas que tenemos para hablar pero esto no quiere decir que sea el nico tema tenemos much simas cosas para hacer y de hecho venimos concretando actividades bastantes interesantes para lo que es el sector tur stico
6011737 es sin duda la m s importante de las que se realizaron en esos destinos en los ltimos a os no solo por la cantidad de participantes sino tambi n porque se produce en un momento en que esos pa ses est n abriendo sus mercados
6011738 apertura de mercados coincide con el crecimiento del pib que alcanzaron en los ltimos a os ambos pa ses y con una corriente de demanda de productos y servicios acentuada
6011739 son dos naciones que est n teniendo una situaci n macroecon mica muy buena con el pib creciendo a tasas muy r pidas per creci 9 el a o pasado y colombia el 8 adem s est n abriendo sus econom as y comprando m s
6011740 hace 4 o 5 a os el pa s no exportaba nada y hoy estamos creciendo much simo y somos casi el principal proveedor en esos dos pa ses eso surge de la calidad de los productos y reconocimiento de los consumidores
6011741 por un lado existen acuerdos de complementaci n econ mica est el acuerdo de complementaci n econ mica 58 ace firmado en el marco del mercosur con per que permite la desgravaci n arancelaria de productos a 10 a os
6011742 con colombia est el ace 59 que entr en vigencia en el 2005 y tambi n desgrava hasta 15 a os muchas de las empresas que van est n viendo que las posibilidades de ingresos se ven favorecidas y esto mejora la posici n competitiva de argentina
6011743 per y colombia son mercados muy competitivos con los que tenemos s lidas relaciones saben que tenemos productos de buena calidad y que est n apareciendo nuevos nichos de mercado
6011744 en el 2006 visitaron la regi n de napa valley en estados unidos el a o siguiente chile y este a o llegaron a mendoza para visitar bodegas y conocer a los verdaderos hacedores de los vinos que tanto disfrutan el a o que viene viajar n a europa para continuar con la experiencia de descubrir las mejores regiones vitivin colas del mundo
6011745 este tipo de contingentes tan calificados en sus conocimientos y exigentes con el tipo de servicios y productos que consumen demuestran que la provincia est trabajando correctamente tanto en la promoci n del destino como en la prestaci n de los distintos servicios
6011746 sabemos perfectamente que los vinos de la provincia est n alcanzando una calidad m s que excepcional y mercados muy exigentes por eso lo que se busca con este tipo de eventos es que el p blico en general pruebe los productos propios y as afianzarlos en el mercado
6011747 los informes realizados por el panel y el p blico determin un puntaje que luego con un an lisis m s tranquilo nos dejar ver en qu lugar estamos parados y hacia d nde deben apuntar los bodegueros para mejorar la calidad del producto
6011748 nuestra provincia se encuentra entre los mejores niveles de la vitivinicultura de argentina pero el problema es que la falta de estos eventos nos hace m s dif cil la difusi n y ver d nde estamos realmente
6011749 internamente sabemos que tenemos un buen nivel pero tambi n hay cosas por mejorar y este tipo de eventos nos ayudar n mucho
6011750 son positivos los resultados tuvimos mucha gente participando y cumplimos el principal objetivo que es mejorar mucho la vitivinicultura de la provincia y tambi n de la regi n
6011751 sabemos perfectamente que los vinos de la provincia est n alcanzando una calidad m s que excepcional y mercados muy exigentes por eso lo que se busca con este tipo de eventos es que el p blico en general pruebe los productos propios y as afianzarlos en el mercado
6011752 desde el gobierno que conduce beder herrera es conocido el matiz que le puso a su gesti n con respecto al apoyo que le brinda a los productores especialmente al sector tradicional por eso la secretar a de agricultura es parte del centro vit cola que son los organizadores y eso hace que conozcamos m s a fondo las necesidades que tiene el sector
6011753 es un orgullo que nuestra provincia cuente con la segunda edici n de evinor por eso hay que destacar mucho la importancia del evento porque ac es donde debemos revalorizar todos los vinos de nuestra zona y regi n pero sobre todo reivindicar nuestro torront s riojano que es el mejor
6011754 tenemos un bueno nivel pero en todos los casos debemos saber comparar y aprender de otros lugares porque hay veces que el mercado dice una cosa y se hace otra
6011755 sabemos que estamos en buen camino pero nos est faltando toda la parte de explotaci n y marketing para el desarrollo de la marca torront s riojanos
6011756 es rescatable el apoyo y acompa amiento que recibi el evento por parte de todo el sector por eso todos estamos trabajando para que estas actividades tengan perdurabilidad en el tiempo
6011757 es la primera vez que vengo al evento y estoy muy contento de haber disfrutado de los exquisitos vinos que hacen en la rioja en especial el torront s
6011758 me voy con la tranquilidad de que corrobor y confirm la calidad de los vinos que se est n haciendo en la regi n
6011759 mi visita est enmarcada en el plan estrat gico vitivin cola 2020 y nuestra participaci n en este tipo de eventos es para posicionar cada vez m s la imagen del vino argentino y de todas las regiones del pa s
6011760 el vino torront s tiene nombre y apellido y es la rioja porque ac es donde alcanza su mayor expresi n
6011761 cumplimos totalmente con las expectativas que ten amos para el evento tuvimos una buena calidad de vinos por eso podemos decir que la cosecha 2008 sac un puntaje de 89 los que deja ver que es excelente
6011762 pero hay que mejorar un poco m s en el trabajo de finca un poco m s de tecnolog a en las bodegas
6011763 cumplimos con la idea de mostrar un poco de lo que tenemos en la zona lo que se hace y el potencial que hay pero siempre desde la degustaci n no hacemos concursos ni propaganda
6011764 translating darwishs poetry was a dream of beauty of art with the glimmer that art will lead to cultural and mutual respect among peoples and in making the translations i focused as much on the strange in the poems as on the familiar and the universal
6011765 to savour the solid and carefully crafted building blocks of darwishs bold and delicate imagery and the echoes of his sound patterns
6011766 darwish has long been an eloquent voice for palestinian identity aspirations and rights but his poetry is never reducible to politics and this volume above all communicates darwishs mighty artistic presence at this utterly mature period of his poetic career
6011767 this new sec resource powered by interactive data will give investors far faster more accurate and more meaningful information about the companies and mutual funds they own
6011768 ideas launch represents a fundamental change in the way the sec collects and publishes company and fund information and in the way that investors will be able to use it
6011769 dynamic system they can use to get the information they need rather than having to wade through an avalanche of paper forms legalese and doublespeak

6011773 von dieser entscheidung profitiert der standort bonn ebenso wie die geisteswissenschaften in nordrhein westfalen insgesamt
6011774 es gibt notsituationen im leben in denen frauen nicht mehr wissen wie sie sich oder die kinder ern hren sollen deshalb sollte man das aus moralischen gr nden auch nicht verurteilen

6011781 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6011782 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6011783 of course there are problems between the owners and the manager but hopefully they can resolve those problems and settle down
6011784 he is a fantastic player and a fantastic signing for the club
6011785 over the last couple of years his work rate has really improved and he is difficult to mark because he is always on the move
6011786 the proximity of the province of ulster to scotland has resulted in lively confluence of people ideas and cultures for many centuries
6011787 i am keen to reveal the breadth and diversity of scottish influence upon ulster as well as introducing readers to significant works the anthology offers fully annotated texts with biographical notices of each author
6011788 this book highlights the range and longevity of scottish literary traditions in the north of ireland it demonstrates the importance of scottish culture philosophy and settlement in a broad range of famous and less well known ulster authors and asserts the national international and global significance of ulster scots writing
6011789 this book reveals the passionate energy and intellectual force of a tradition that owes much to scottish religious conviction and the scottish enlightenment this anthology opens up a rich and fertile arena of expression and inquiry and is a major intervention in the cultural heritages of ulster ireland and the scottish connection
6011790 it provides a timely contribution to debates on ulster scots language identity and heritage and celebrates a significant literary tradition
6011791 danskerne b r have sikkerhed omkring deres pensionsforhold og den s rlige pensionsopsparings liv er et klassisk eksempel p hvordan politikerne skaber usikkerhed omkring pensionsforhold
6011792 der er tale om en opsparing og ikke en skat og derfor er det usikkert hvor meget danskernes forbrugsadf rd reelt p virkes
6011793 det private forbrug er allerede gearet ganske meget ned og det synes ikke oplagt at det er her den konomiske politik skal strammes hvis der overhovedet er behov for strammere konomisk politi
6011794 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6011795 i dont have any doubt about that we have to be here
6011796 i tell you in all conscience if it had to be done again i would do it
6011797 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6011798 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6011799 we are not here against the afghans we are with the afghans so as not to leave them alone in the face of barbarism
6011800 the look they had in their eyes the way they moved their fingers heads and bodies

6011807 this can be the beginning of the war if not properly handled but it can also as ive said there is still a chance in going back to peace as long as both parties for us and for the side of the government will implement utmost strength in order to hold back the situation
6011808 we are trying our best to restrain our commanders in order to save the situation
6011809 in fact commander bravo already has made his commitment unless he is attacked he will no longer make another attack likewise with commander kato
6011810 there were so many delays in the negotiations there has been actuations by the grp that they were trying to renege on what had been agreed on already
6011811 this is an unexpected situation we have been very faithful in the peace process and we hold the supremacy of the peace process we are very saddened by this situation and we hope we are still optimistic that everybody will cooperate and save the situation and the peace process
6011812 we are negotiating with the government of the republic of the philippines and they have to be represented that is why we have been insisting that the peace process should become a national policy we dont feel that it is our obligation to talk to the local officials
6011813 the critics are just looking at loopholes in order to attack the moa relating to the so called thinking that the present administration is trying to use the moa and milf to continue in power
6011814 it may be beyond the constitution but the constitution can be amended and revised to accommodate the agreement what is important is during the amendment it wil not derogate or water down the agreement because we have worked this out for more than 10 years now
6011815 our people cannot speak some people have opted to speak through their guns they say this is the only way that they will be heard this is the real situation
6011816 the minarets are our lances the domes our helmets the believers our army
6011817 nothings changed were still sexual anarchists were still sexual anarchists
6011818 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
6011819 an islamic regime must be serious in every field there are no jokes in islam there is no humor in islam there is no fun in islam
6011820 there is no shortage of cheap labour turkey isnt needed
6011821 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
6011822 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial
6011823 the material seized from you is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
6011824 it is that material which was possessed by you for a specific intention to be used in due course to provide practical assistance in terrorist activity
6011825 folder demonstrating in careful methodical and lethal detail the step by step instructions of how to make a suicide bombers vest or belt packed with ball bearings and explosives
6011826 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6011827 he seemed fairly relaxed but tried to keep himself to himself some passengers started hassling him and asking questions but he got moved away from them all
6011828 at first he asked to be allowed to enter to thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted
6011829 as a nation we cannot allow this crucial and unique piece of both british and world heritage to be neglected in this way the future of the site buildings resources and equipment at bletchley park must be preserved for future generations
6011830 my geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled
6011831 you kept quiet for 30 years i couldnt have kept quiet for 30 minutes
6011832 actually i was lucky because i married a mathematician from hut 6 so although we never talked to the family or anyone else we have talked about it to each other
6011833 other people had to force it so far down that they have forgotten it all and its very difficult to collect oral history it was the way to do it nobody talked to anybody outside their own unit because if the germans had ever found out that we had broken their codes that would have been the crown jewels gone
6011834 one should never forget the poles who first uncovered enigma and dilly knox arrived absolutely on day one he was the pioneer he was an absolutely wonderful character and very easy to work with but he was odd just like someone out of alice in wonderland
6011835 i must absolutely emphasise that i take absolutely no credit for this i was the one who happened to get the message to decode
6011836 most of the time we never knew what it was that we broke because once we had worked out the crib we passed it to a machinist to decode the whole message
6011837 the juror who found this report went looking for it in defiance of what i said
6011838 it is very unfortunate for all those concerned and for the tax payer the chief consideration is that this defendant receives a fair trial
6011839 as a nation we cannot allow this crucial and unique piece of both british and world heritage to be neglected in this way the future of the site buildings resources and equipment at bletchley park must be preserved for future generations
6011840 my geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled
6011841 encourage consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months
6011842 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6011843 he seemed fairly relaxed but tried to keep himself to himself some passengers started hassling him and asking questions but he got moved away from them all
6011844 at first he asked to be allowed to enter to thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted
6011845 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by the welfarism and political correctness if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle it is
6011846 it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
6011847 that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
6011848 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority gla or the title of first deputy mayor i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
6011849 as far as tim is concerned his appointment was boriss biggest coup by far he is a very successful businessman who was going to be chief executive of london somehow all of that has gone for a piece of chalk
6011850 relationships on the eighth floor are riddled with tensions and while boris was keen to give him this position of first deputy mayor mr parkers colleagues were clearly not supportive
6011851 the wheels are coming off this new administration why is boris losing yet another adviser has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business
6011852 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6011853 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6011854 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
6011855 i spoke to him just now and he said everything is ok he is happy to be going home he was in a good mood
6011856 it was famously vital in enabling britain to survive in 1940 41 and then for the allies to triumph in 1945 but more than that as the birthplace of the computer it was one of the three crucibles with peenem nde in germany and los alamos in the us in which the modern world was forged it stands for the triumph of intelligence over barbarism we would let down not only the generation who worked in bletchley but our childrens generation if we failed to preserve it for posterity
6011857 good minds at bletchley helped save their generation from evil now this generation must help save it
6011858 the worst suggestion i heard was that we should preserve the country house and tear down all the wooden huts because they are rotten and unsightly
6011859 they may be unsightly but that is where history was made if they just took a little of the millions they are spending on the 2012 olympics they could save this site
6011860 the cavaliers brain is like a size ten foot that has been shoved into a size six shoe
6011861 it is described in humans as one of the most painful conditions you can have a piston type headache if you took a stick and beat a dog to create that pain youd be prosecuted but theres nothing to stop you breeding a dog with it
6011862 i defy anybody to say that they would approve of brother sister mating or father daughter mating in humans
6011863 and yet if you speak to dog breeders father daughter or father granddaughter mating is common they must know that this is going to cause problems
6011864 when i watch crufts what i see is a parade of mutants
6011865 its some freakish garish beauty pageant that frankly has nothing to do with health and welfare
6011866 but it is far less common than it ever was in the past we are the ones that are trying to put things right
6011867 if dog breeders insist on going further down that road
6011868 i can say with confidence that there is a universe of suffering waiting for many of these breeds
6011869 the crowns case is fatally flawed i am drawn to the conclusion that the crown cannot prove that the exertion and stress of the incident was the sole cause of the fatal arrhythmia
6011870 in these circumstances if i was obliged to make a ruling i would withdraw this count from the jury this indication is based on the state of the evidence as it is now
6011871 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
6011872 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
6011873 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
6011874 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
6011875 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
6011876 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration
6011877 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
6011878 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
6011879 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
6011880 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
6011881 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
6011882 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
6011883 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration
6011884 a minicab pulled up and there was a guy in the back who was really drunk who started shouting you fucking paki
6011885 our friends were there and said look mate we dont want any problems just go away because youre being racist then the same guy came back and walked towards nilanthan and threw a punch he must have had a blade in his hand because he ended up with a slashed throat
6011886 it was a little blade but blood just went everywhere i took my shirt off to help and it was soaked right through
6011887 words cant express how i feel right now my brother is gone but every day every second we will be thinking of him he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed my father cannot accept his only son is dead he keeps repeating the words hes gone over and over again

6011889 i am very concerned about community reactions because of the different races involved it is very shocking
6011890 a poem begins with a lump in the throat a homesickness or a love sickness it is a reaching out toward expression an effort to find fulfillment a complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found the word
6011891 we are pleased to take delivery on schedule of our seventh contracted newbuilding since the ipo providing accretive growth consistent with our strategy and extending our relationship with osg taking advantage of our balance sheet strength and following the signing of our new revolving facility earlier in the year we funded the acquisition of aris ii primarily with debt

6011894 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6011895 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone

6011909 many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavor for spammers
6011910 there are approximately 250 million people out there who are interested in these kinds of products and have made purchases from spam in the past thats equivalent to double the population of japan mixed in with every other internet user as a spammer how do you reach that market without knowing specifically who these people are and with the bare minimum of expense easy send lots of emails to everyone

6011915 it was the most incredible news i cant imagine winning a lottery more important than this one to see history being made its just incredible
6011916 by looking at the list you can clearly see what we were going for which demonstrates the diversity of support for the senator
6011917 everyone is asking what will i talk to him about or asking will you put this word in for me
6011918 i dont think we are going to get a chance to really talk to him for long
6011919 i think he chose people with various backgrounds but who are ordinary people who have been inspired by him
6011920 if she knows hes going to be somewhere in the state shes on the road to be there
6011921 there are more democrats independents and disillusioned republicans coming over to the obama campaign

6011925 the bias against the memorandum of agreement and the milf is a revival of the century old sentiment of anti moro it is also anti poor if this country cannot give them justice you cannot blame the milf if they long for their own land and even their own country
6011926 if the moa will not be signed then we will go back to square one hostilities might again resume and there will be a fourth generation warfare
6011927 we are pushing for constitutional reform after the peace agreement has been signed

6011930 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6011931 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6011932 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6011933 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
6011934 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
6011935 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
6011936 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
6011937 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
6011938 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
6011939 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
6011940 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
6011941 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
6011942 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
6011943 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
6011944 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
6011945 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
6011946 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
6011947 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
6011948 pengakuan itu kita anggap informasi awal kita kumpulkan bukti bukti lain karena tidak cukup hanya pengakuan saja

6011950 you always told me about your friends in this group and it seemed like you guys always had a really good time but this is the first time that i really understand why they are all so special to you they all have such big hearts and there is so much love for one another
6011951 in general when you look in marion county we have some of the least impacted waters across the state especially when you compare us to counties in south florida
6011952 other folks are not in a position to say that
6011953 you have to look at the cost benefits of the different projects we identify the cost analysis is to determine where do we get the most bang for the buck
6011954 this may shock you but basically they still have no idea what this thing will do
6011955 his lawyer should have offered this to us nine months ago
6011956 it is my strong desire to put this litigation to bed but i respectfully need city councils approval of this final proposal to complete this now

6011967 making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism
6011968 its valid for the parliament or anybody to want a cut in cost recovery as monitoring here is very important however we also have to remember that the average cost recovery in indonesia is 23 of revenue and if this is cut by 15 the cost recovery will only be 19
6011969 if indonesia continues to force a cut in cost recovery to 19 theres a big possibility that indonesia will be unattractive for investors
6011970 if exploration activities are reduced the oil and gas industry in indonesia will surely lag in the next few years
6011971 again cheap costs and reserve availability arent enough to attract investors its everybodys responsibility to improve the investment climate so that we can depend more on the oil and gas sector to support the state budget
6011972 what if some of the investors do make more money from cost recovery barrels rather than from profit barrels
6011973 if i were in charge of bpmigas i would reward pscs which increase production and discover new reserves with more incentives and i would punish those which are truly not efficient or not conducting operations alligned with international petroleum industry practices
6011974 we are currently evaluating the possibility of oferring a different type of petroleum contract of which theres no cost recovery
6011975 without cost recovery the government can only receive taxes and royalties without supervision and management if thats the case what would happen to our sovereignty on mineral resources
6011976 why would you travel all the way to india when waiting for cancer results
6011977 normal people awaiting results of that nature would wait before commiting themselves not go on a much publicised programme to have the results announced
6011978 known risk factors for this type of cancer are history of multiple sex partners and sexual intercourse at an early age
6011979 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6011980 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the
6011981 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6011982 in china as in other countries applications for demonstrations must go through

6011986 deber a aparecer una oportunidad muy muy atractiva para cambiar esta postura creo que es algo altamente improbable aunque no imposible
6011987 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
6011988 i think its important to look at these results on top of last years which were also ugly when you look at where the industry is now compared to where it was in 2006 its lost a third of its profits which is a staggering amount the industry is caught in a perfect storm of pennsylvania economic unease and high fuel prices
6011989 i was hoping an attractive lot like that would have been picked up quickly i guess its indicative of the real estate market and the economy in general

6011992 the major projects which really see it interface with the business are not coming around as regularly there is no point moving from one company to another if you are just performing the same role
6011993 there is going to be less churn because there is a level of nervousness around the economy and it is seen as better to stay in an organisation you know and understand
6011994 nothing bad they just took me out for precautionary reasons
6011995 terrell thomas has a hamstring strain and it will be a day by day kind of thing
6011996 it happened during the lions game but i re injured it during one of the kickoffs i ran into the wedge and i fell and the guy fell on top of me
6011997 i told the trainers im going to try to go back out there and on the very next kickoff i tried to lock out on it and it just gave out i told them i wanted to shut it down and we went and took the x rays and the x rays were negative the doctor looked at it were gonna get an mri on tuesday but they said its mainly just a mild sprain in the ac joint it kind of nags you im just going to take care of it my body heals fast it heals quick im just going to get the treatment on it get ready to come back out here hopefully i get another opportunity like i had today to get some good reps in there with the ones and make plays
6011998 brandon london had a shoulder that was bothering him going in and he got hit on that shoulder
6011999 he is very sore today tuesday i dont know what his status will be if there was practice today on tuesday he would not be able to practice today brandon had a sore shoulder going in got hit on that shoulder was sore after the game and we are hoping that he is able to respond right away but as of now if he didnt work on wednesday it wouldnt be a surprise
6012000 wright seemed to have a back strain and hopefully that is all it is
6012001 kay jay harris has some injuries and he will be a guy that we will have to decide on how we are going to handle that but it is a serious injury
6012002 i do know it is a combination of ankle and mid foot
6012003 we are supposed to get some guys back to practice on wednesday and we are saying right now that wr steve smith wr mario manningham and wr amani toomer will come back amani feels good and i am hoping that he can go and get right back in here and not have to be too concerned with what he does and doesnt do we are going to have to spoon feed manningham and smith back in and i am hoping that doesnt take more than just a day to do that
6012004 pk lawrence tynes was supposed to be under a ten day observation period and i think that takes us probably to mid week
6012005 i dont know if you find out why let me know
6012006 osi got a sack against the browns and i was very upset out there thats the way it is when he gets a sack im upset and when i get a sack hes upset and i think that helps us we definitely fuel the flame if any of us get sacks i guess you can call us haters its not like were hating on each other its more like you got one now i have to get one or else im going to have to deal with you all week in the film room saying i got one and you didnt so i think that really helps us and we thrive off stuff like that

6012017 op dit moment zitten we nog met een klein overschot aan leraren in het basisonderwijs
6012018 de definitieve cijfers zijn pas begin januari bekend een vergelijking met vorig jaar is lastig tot vorig jaar konden studenten zich zowel via de ibg als via de pabos inschrijven dit jaar kan dat alleen via de gezamenlijke website studielink
6012019 de vele publiciteit rond de verzwaring van de opleiding een oorzaak van de daling kan zijn er zijn taal en rekentoetsen gekomen en ook in de rest van het programma hebben we de teugels strakgetrokken daardoor komen er minder studenten terwijl er in het eerste jaar meer afvallen de groep die overblijft bestaat uit uitstekende studenten die gemotiveerd zijn en hard werken zulke leraren willen we graag daarom wordt zeker niet overwogen het programma weer te verlichten
6012020 het aantal inschrijvingen is daar stabiel terwijl we liever een forse stijging zouden zien
6012021 wij hadden gehoopt dat de maatschappelijke discussie over topsalarissen ook gevoerd zou gaan worden in de bestuurskamers en directiekamers van de thuiszorg maar dat lijkt niet te gebeuren helaas zien we in deze sector een toenemend aantal fusies en daardoor ook steeds hogere salarissen dat betekent dat de overheid zowel qua fusies als qua salarissen duidelijk grenzen moet gaan stellen
6012022 daarvan worden cli nten als eerste de dupe zij krijgen dan abrupt geen zorg meer en het personeel komt van de ene op de andere dag op straat te staan
6012023 er bestaan al afspraken maar blijkbaar houdt men zich er niet aan

6012042 be applied to the internet because it is impossible to know what work taken as a whole means when all web content is interconnected and it is equally impossible to determine the community standards by which the material should be judged when the internet reaches across the nation and across the world
6012043 i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door
6012044 the end result is the same you caused me to lose my data
6012045 if you know your site was infected dont you have an ethical responsibility to provide a warning shouldnt we change the rules so that the guy with a sexually transmitted disease has to say hes infecting people
6012046 if this were to prevent one breach of someones private data the good would have outweighed the expense
6012047 the real problem is that no one is fixing their sites
6012048 the same tens of thousands of sites get infected over and over with different malware using the same methods a few class action lawsuits could be a good incentive to fix this
6012049 should hundreds of millions of disclosure messages have gone out we dont want to create unnecessary noise or panic or distract from the messages that really matter
6012050 we have a real problem with hard data in our industry and we need a kind of statistical clearinghouse

6012052 i spoke to adrian last wednesday and his campaigning spirit and his optimism remained undimmed
6012053 my thoughts are with his family at this time and i know they will be proud that adrians achievements will continue to help others after he has gone
6012054 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6012055 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6012056 kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew him and loved him

6012058 he has fat all over which literally hangs in parts his breasts fall like a womans but he has powerful shoulders and tremendous thighs
6012059 people think ten kilometre racings about ten kilometres its not
6012060 its about the ability to swim fast for ten kilometres and quite a few can do that but then sprint to the line in the last 400 metres we should have won but the girls did a fantastic job
6012061 i cant describe how it feels because swimming has been part of my life for 16 years
6012062 in that time i have thought of constantly about competing in the olympics and winning a medal to do both is amazing
6012063 so much can go wrong in such a long race with 1 000 metres to go i felt like i had a good chance of at least getting a medal im happy to have the silver ill probably have a cry later on when its sunk in and ive spoke to my parents
6012064 your stomach is the size of a pea because all the blood rushes to your arms your body is saying stop but your head is saying come on keep going

6012067 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6012068 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6012069 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6012070 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6012071 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6012072 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6012073 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6012074 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6012075 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6012076 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
6012077 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory

6012086 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
6012087 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
6012088 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
6012089 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
6012090 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
6012091 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model

6012101 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
6012102 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
6012103 i see this man pulling this long gun from under his shirt and he started shooting i just couldnt believe it some people thought it was firecrackers but i knew different i saw the little girl rubbing her leg and the boy with blood coming out of his head
6012104 opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
6012105 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
6012106 we need to keep the young people off the streets
6012107 and the parents need help the law is the law
6012108 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
6012109 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones
6012110 the children cant stay in their homes because of what their mothers are doing behind the bedroom door they are having sex the boys especially have a big problem with that every kid i know who is in trouble its always the same story they cant handle their mothers boyfriends
6012111 i hope it works but i think its going to cause a lot of trouble a lot of kids are going to end up being locked up i bet you
6012112 i just cant be there thats all they cant coop us up like that its not right
6012113 i really dont care about it i will still be outside anyways
6012114 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6012115 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6012116 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
6012117 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6012118 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6012119 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
6012120 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
6012121 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
6012122 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
6012123 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
6012124 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
6012125 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6012126 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume
6012127 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
6012128 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6012129 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6012130 i dont want any sex offenders in this country but the point is vietnamese officials have deported him to the uk so as we do whenever sex offenders return to this country we need to plan for what happens when people return
6012131 never mind his individual case anybody who is returning to the uk in these sorts of circumstances would be met at the airport by police officers would be served with an order which effectively puts them on to the sex offenders register
6012132 one of the things we have learned generally about sex offenders is they do want to travel to places where they can exploit children
6012133 if there is evidence the person is travelling abroad to abuse children we can get an order that stops them travelling there should be more of those
6012134 in every single case the court has to make the decision but this is the type of case where i find it pretty hard to imagine it is legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6012135 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6012136 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6012137 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
6012138 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6012139 i grew up with my dad im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
6012140 im angry it makes me feel like a non person
6012141 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
6012142 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
6012143 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
6012144 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
6012145 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6012146 full respect for the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
6012147 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or whether the public will rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it
6012148 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or whether the public will rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it
6012149 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6012150 i dont have any doubt about that we have to be here
6012151 i tell you in all conscience if it had to be done again i would do it
6012152 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6012153 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6012154 we are not here against the afghans we are with the afghans so as not to leave them alone in the face of barbarism
6012155 he was just looking out to see what was going on when they opened fire and he was hit three times there was no reason for this he wasnt doing anything
6012156 they looted the main shop and then started shooting people
6012157 he had gone to see if he could find any food it was a risky thing to do maybe he shouldnt have gone out but he had to feed his family they killed him because he was a georgian and a young man
6012158 they came in two cars usually a military jeep at the front and a minibus at the back its usually young guys in their early 20s they behave like theyre on a hunting trip
6012159 she doesnt have friends or relatives here but well find somewhere for her to stay
6012160 i am an old man this is all i had all the pictures of my family everything had gone now i have nowhere to live who will look after me
6012161 the russians invaded so they have to take responsibility for what happened on occupied territory this is another srebrenica
6012162 he pretended to like eton rifles he went to f ing eton
6012163 if the west swallows the pill and forgives russia the georgian war the invasion of peacekeeping tanks into ukraine will just be a matter of time
6012164 how do you prevent the russian ships from coming in
6012165 i dont know of any way to do so if we continue to stick to the point of view of not letting them in this will mean a war between ukraine and russia
6012166 all the instruments from rock band 2 guitar hero world tour and rock revolution will be cross compatible
6012167 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6012168 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6012169 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6012170 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6012171 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6012172 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6012173 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6012174 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6012175 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6012176 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6012177 a person opts to go over the border their information is going to be collected and held anyway
6012178 if you dont want to go over the border you dont have to
6012179 to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records
6012180 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
6012181 i would not rule out that i said that if they provide such a contraption they should have at least helped out
6012182 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6012183 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our co operation and relationship with poland it will deepen our defence co operation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6012184 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6012185 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6012186 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6012187 no one should be afraid of the shield if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
6012188 we want russia to be able to have the possibility if it so desires to inspect the future base
6012189 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london
6012190 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality
6012191 he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
6012192 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6012193 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
6012194 he has been calling angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and rice for months and they have all been telling him to stop worrying that the russians wont do anything and theyve basically been ignoring him
6012195 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe
6012196 think how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
6012197 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
6012198 any civilised country would act the same way i may remind you that on september 11 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
6012199 i knew i had to fight from behind in the race i may not be fast but i can fight
6012200 when it comes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the no 1 city in the nation
6012201 we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6012202 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6012203 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6012204 pretty much the same level of difficulty as drilling an oil rig but you dont have to pump oil
6012205 you could imagine going as much as 15 20 25 miles offshore where its virtually invisible to land
6012206 nobody is going to see a wind farm off the coast of queens in the next year
6012207 the idea of renewable power in and around new york city is very realistic
6012208 the question is what type makes the most sense and in what time frame that is what we are trying to figure out
6012209 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
6012210 there can be no business as usual under present circumstances
6012211 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
6012212 considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6012213 we have a duty to entertain if we can but i also have a duty to win games
6012214 weve been a bit loose defensively last year we had a good record and thats something we need to look at
6012215 weve got players who can provide some exciting football going forward but we have to get the balance right
6012216 greg abbott and i are a bit concerned about the fact that weve conceded four goals and weve been trying to put that to rights in training this week
6012217 were not always going to be able to get three or four goals each time we concede two so weve got to stop making that difficult for ourselves
6012218 but ive always said i will judge a striker on the days they dont score
6012219 the goals are obvious to see danny graham did a good job alongside danny carlton at bristol rovers and carlton did a good job alongside danny graham against crewe
6012220 im happy with that partnership and the players seem to be positive with it
6012221 one of the worst case scenarios was this idea that you might be able to search someones laptop or ipod for infringing content at the border or at the airport
6012222 we do not want mandated technological blocks such as deep packet inspection and filtering that would inhibit the internet communitys capacity and openness to technological innovation
6012223 all the parties negotiating here are kind of sworn to secrecy
6012224 im disappointed that they did not approve the six turbines within one and a half miles of el paso which el paso finds acceptable
6012225 my main concern is the white oak project but if this one passes it greases the slope
6012226 once this is done we will be issued checks for the 413 000 loan and the 20 000 grant rural development is providing the town to help fund the construction of the new highway building
6012227 the brocton electric department did the work and the town paid for the materials
6012228 after the meeting there were a lot of worried people concerned about how they would get to llanelli and that they would miss out on the chance to take part
6012229 i looked into the venue criteria and at potential venues in ammanford and contacted the councils policy liaison officer david poulter
6012230 i got the stone into the pond and the ripples developed from that
6012231 we have responded to local concerns about finding a suitable venue in the locality
6012232 it has taken some time to locate a suitable venue
6012233 were at your mercy we hope you take our needs into consideration and not just money
6012234 were under no legal obligation to notify anybody of anything we made a good faith effort
6012235 this transmission line is a physical thing its got to go somewhere
6012236 its not fair or right to say i dont like it put it on his or her property thats not going to fly were not going to move this line just because we were able to accommodate some minor changes
6012237 we didnt decide to do this just because we didnt have anything else to do
6012238 these power lines are going to be built even if og amp e steps out of the picture
6012239 if theyre only impacting four houses i think theyve done a fine job
6012240 they answered every question to the best of their ability i dont know that everybody liked their answers
6012241 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean windfarm
6012242 some want a cap and trade system which is like taking three right turns instead of one left
6012243 and theyll also require cost effective retrofits of our existing larger buildings
6012244 its too early to tell what this will do to our timing
6012245 were still very committed to building in the panhandle but there are still some outstanding issues to be resolved
6012246 the question is is this the last transmission line to be built out there
6012247 at this time shell has no specific comments regarding the details of the final order as we are currently reviewing the ruling
6012248 c s lan wieso hat meine 20 08 2008 um 09 23

6012251 well have to do some more studying on what the next step is going to be
6012252 its a bad deal for this county its a bad deal for this country
6012253 i want it to be competitive but keep in mind this is british petroleum one of the 25 largest companies in the world and they dont need a heck of a lot of help from us
6012254 for a 300 million or 400 million project 600 000 in taxes is not that big of a deal
6012255 typically companies like bp will lease 10 different areas and choose the one or two that are best to build this year
6012256 that way we know each year what its going to look like and well know what kind of money is coming in
6012257 i hope youre going to see a drop in your tax rate
6012258 you should when you have an additional 130 million to 140 million on your tax rolls
6012259 i dont really like tax abatements but i understand we have to use them
6012260 we will have to do environmental studies and what ever regulatory permitting is required out in that area so when the opportunity might arise that we can connect to the transmission line then we are ready to go
6012261 so when new brunswick power puts out a call for proposals for renewable energy we will put in a proposal
6012262 we have to order turbines and right now getting turbines takes 18 months to two years so by the time we say yes we have a contract and can move ahead it could be a good two years by the time the turbines are up and running
6012263 we want to work with the people in the area the communities we want to be involved with them
6012264 were hoping it will be an economic advantage to the area so were excited about it and we hope the people in your area are also excited about it

6012277 hospitals and hospital administrators have traditionally discriminated against mental health conditions and people with them thats principally because of in my view the stigma attached to mental illnesses

6012331 a prova foi mais f cil eles disseram que foram bem nas duas est o mais tranq ilos

6012338 as soon as i finished a five a side match which was a memorial for my cousin who died in a car crash a few years back seven or eight men walked on to the field and came straight at me
6012339 they were holding sticks and metal bars they tried to hit me but fortunately didnt manage it they were wearing t shirts with i hate bari and even chased after my brother gianluca thankfully they were scared off by a police car and a few of our friends
6012340 physically i am fine but psychologically i am hurting badly i am furious at this incredibly serious incident it happened in front of my wife my nine month old baby and many other children who were at the game
6012341 i never imagined someone could organise an ambush in my home city its shameful
6012342 lecce is my city my family lives here i just hope this incident can shock people into realising how ridiculous that attitude is and that those responsible do not get away with it

6012346 antes est bamos exentos del pago de ingresos brutos pero en la ltima reforma tributaria en la provincia se estableci que pas bamos a ser favorecidos por la al cuota cero que no es lo mismo
6012347 las actividades primarias exportadoras est n exentas de tributar ingresos brutos y la citricultura exporta el 95 de lo que produce en fresco o en forma industrializada ser a injusto que quienes producen el 5 que se destina al mercado interno generalmente agricultores de baja escala deban pagar el gravamen
6012348 es una actitud positiva del gobierno que demuestra su entendimiento sobre el productor agropecuario

6012368 no sab a qu hora era pero s el d a porque mi esposa estaba por tener familia y le ped a un guardia que me consiga informaci n a las 6 o 7 de la tarde se abre la puerta sic y tiran a un tipo empezamos a corrernos las vendas para tratar de ver y le preguntamos qui n era soy vargas aignasse nos dijo y cont que estaba enfermo que le hab an pegado mucho y que lo hab an picaneado en la lengua y en los test culos a todos nos torturaban mucho f sica y psicol gicamente
6012369 l nos dijo que hab an hecho una pantomima en la c rcel una payasada que consist a en que lo iban a subir a una camioneta pero lo pusieron en un auto y lo llevaron a educaci n f sica para torturarlo
6012370 el fue quien le dijo a vargas aignasse que se prepare que lo iban a llevar a pasear a las horas lo sacaron rameando sic y en villa urquiza donde estuve hasta julio de 1977 me enter de que lo hab an muerto otro pajarito para el cadillal el general antonio bussi no quiere a ninguno de estos zurditos dec an
6012371 me dijeron que no buscara m s que estaba muerto y en el cadillal
6012372 me dijeron que no lo busque m s que estaba muerto y en el cadillal el era sumamente inteligente pero tambi n ingenuo dec a que no ten a nada que ocultar era justiciero imprudente en el debate parlamentario por las verdades que dec a con convicciones profundas
6012373 el valor que se les da a los an nimos que recibimos se relaciona con las ganas de tener algo cierto entre todo lo incierto que es que haya un desaparecido
6012374 entre ellos se detestaban pero ninguno empu nunca un arma ni siquiera en las escaramuzas que hubo en el monte porque no hubo ning n combate directo nunca se comportaron valientemente o como fuera en un campo de batalla nunca hubo una guerra en tucum n sino un ej rcito con un tremendo poder b lico frente a un grupo de 150 desarrapados

6012377 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6012378 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6012379 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6012380 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6012381 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6012382 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6012383 i told him you are on camera we are recording you right now
6012384 he said i dont care just give me the money
6012385 woman or kid theyre going to do stuff like that unless you stop them
6012386 and go on till you come to the end then stop
6012387 ich habe einen absolut guten job dort gemacht nichts ist verschwunden

6012390 meine erste adresse bis zur bildung einer neuen regierung ist der koalitionspartner
6012391 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6012392 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
6012393 i think nigeria have a big chance to win the tournament because they have many great players who can turn maybe a draw into a win
6012394 the players are very strong and have a lot of experience to win big competitions because they played together in the world youth championship in 2005
6012395 we are really disappointed with the result we expected more from this game but we played against a very strong team today we know their strength every player is strong and fast and we had difficulty keeping up in the first 30 minutes
6012396 but we had chances to level in the last 15 minutes of the first half and the first 15 minutes of the second half
6012397 and then they scored two goals and it became difficult for us
6012398 we will see there are 13 days for the transfer to be done
6012399 its a big big two weeks for us the key is we get other players in and improve the team as we go the balance of the team isnt quite right at the moment and we need players with premiership experience
6012400 theyre moving their mouths but the blood in their ears is running down is running down
6012401 who do you need nobody youre lucky nobodys around i can pour my own drinks

6012422 we have got just less than two weeks and i am hopeful that we can sign some players
6012423 we need back up if you think that freddie bouma wont be back for four to six months if you get two injuries then you are back to square one
6012424 i cant be tied down to a time as it is easier said than done but these are the things we are looking at
6012425 we will try and look at that and see if we can do something before the deadline
6012426 there might be an exit or two but i would rather we were trying to add to the squad
6012427 leon is a young boy who not much more than a year ago was playing at a very different standard when he was competing to stay in the championship
6012428 hes made a huge jump and hes coming on leaps and bounds every day
6012429 there is a bright future for leon on the evidence of playing against those players on saturday
6012430 he did exceptionally well part of any players job as they go along is to learn
6012431 any defeat or bad performance is not the end of the road youve got to get back to training and try to learn those lessons to make you better in the next game
6012432 im sure leon will do that but no two games are the same a lot of saturday was about defending deeper because they pushed us back
6012433 they are all very important lessons in a young defenders progress
6012434 warum sind wir so gut im segeln rudern und radfahren aber so unf hig in der leichtathletik
6012435 die australier scherzen gern dass wir briten gut seien in sitzsportarten ungl cklicherweise haben sie recht hindernislauf kugelsto en gewichtheben hoffnungslos aber gib uns einen sitz auf einem rad in einem boot oder auf einem pferd und wir k nnen alle schlagen
6012436 versuche es nicht in sportarten in denen jeder gut sein kann leichtathletik boxen fu ball suche dir technologisch komplizierte und teure sportarten wie segeln oder noch besser solche die sowohl hirnerweichend stumpfsinnig sind als auch teure einrichtungen ben tigen wie bahnradfahren oder rudern

6012438 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
6012439 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
6012440 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6012441 today western leaders must ask themselves why their policies have failed
6012442 without urgent troop redeployment attacks in and around kabul are likely to be stepped up with the taliban on the very doorstep of the afghan capital the situation can only get worse for nato isaf forces and for the afghan people
6012443 what are the aims of this war how many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives
6012444 we know these kids are the toughest we want to make them tough and smart
6012445 in history one of the courses could be on the culture of honor what protecting the tribe was about from the greeks to the samurai warrior
6012446 it is in how one understands the word discipline it is most associated with punishment and means painful stern and harsh laced with punishment that is not what the word means in our school

6012448 floridas probably one of the best states in the world to deal with hurricanes one thing they do is they always over prepare which is not a bad thing
6012449 was a sign to everybody that they knew this was not going to be a disaster or a major hurricane
6012450 however at this time of year which is really the beginning of the active hurricane season down here nobody takes anything for granted in terms of what a storm may have and hold for them

6012466 my name is nurollah and im the father of a girl who has been raped
6012467 in our society it is not the perpetrator of the act of violation who carries the shame of dishonour it is the victim whos condemned to an eternally cursed life
6012468 the human rights woman keeps coming to our house and taking pictures of my daughter my daughter has not been raped she just injured herself when she was out playing

6012482 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
6012483 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points
6012484 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
6012485 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
6012486 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic
6012487 they want to not only get rid of the georgian government but get rid of all idea of georgias independence and freedom
6012488 every day that goes by after the deadline is a day that the world can see that russia is not living up to its word
6012489 with every commitment and every failure to live up to the commitment international pressure will grow
6012490 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
6012491 full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
6012492 they can put it to a vote if they want to
6012493 we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6012494 risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6012495 here we are at gatwick airport it has suffered investment wise because baa has focused more on heathrow airport
6012496 there are problems here which go beyond the monopoly which are to do with regulation the way investment is managed the capacity at airports runway capacity and so forth and also more broadly just the absence of any kind of grand plan since baa was privatized more than two decades ago
6012497 does evil exist and if it does what do we do about it

6012503 really our focus now has been on how we best take care of the guys that arent there anymore and help them find jobs with other teams
6012504 were working hard on how to end gracefully obviously weve got people we owe money to so were doing absolutely everything in our power to get those people the money we owe them whether thats on an institutional side lenders or equally as important with our employees who arent there anymore
6012505 id always maintained that the day we left blizzard north was the hardest professional day id ever had

6012517 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules
6012518 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
6012519 we will make social media technology bend to our rules
6012520 blow up all the rule books let self organizing networks evolve
6012521 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6012522 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6012523 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6012524 in china as in other countries applications for demonstrations must go through legal procedures

6012534 this is the time at the end of the day its not just about hard work but she needs to ensure she can enjoy the rest of her life
6012535 shes a girly girl and perceived as americas sweetheart so her future is cemented by what she had accomplished and how she is perceived
6012536 not everybody has the story not everybody has all the elements companies are calling up for her to do modeling
6012537 what you are going to see is the people who hit are going to be explosive
6012538 there will be more small opportunities for a lot more people but not in terms of the upper end
6012539 only a very few will make it they will do so by being great in the next few years working in the media
6012540 these athletes need to have an additional hook a story pursuit or career that transcends their olympic glory
6012541 the olympics may well be a door opener to the future but success relies on offering something distinctive just being an olympian is no guarantee

6012547 the theft of drain covers has become a huge problem in the county
6012548 the cost of full replacement can be about 1 000 a cover which with more than 1 000 stolen shows the scale of the problem
6012549 quite apart from the danger to pedestrians cyclists and motorists that this theft causes the replacement cost is an unnecessary burden on the council tax payer and is money that could be put to better use
6012550 if anyone sees anything suspicious or people working at roadside gullies using vehicles that dont have durham county council on them please call us on our highways action line on 0191 370 6000
6012551 some of the grates have been removed from roads where there is a 60mph limit

6012575 if we stay focused and play our game we will win
6012576 i thought i had scored and i was turning around to celebrate when i saw the ball had not gone into the net i couldnt believe it
6012577 they lost in the final that year so that should make it interesting
6012578 when they see a senior player who is not proud hustles for the ball works hard for the team and just tries to do his best it motivates the players and i am proud to be part of this group
6012579 one thing we should know is that what they are playing on saturday is like a cup final and in situations like that any thing can really happen
6012580 they have done well up till this point despite the early criticisms from nigerians but now they are in the final i think they can just nick the gold medal
6012581 for now i want it to be personal but if you work with the club and anybody at the top hierarchy of the mines can interfere with your work then i have to quit
6012582 i applied as ceo and not as an employee of the mines so they have to understand that
6012583 i think leaving the club is the wisest thing to do for now because there is no financial support coming from anywhere
6012584 joining dabs com and the bt group is a great opportunity for me dabs com is a very successful business with access to tremendous assets through bt this puts it in a prime position to capitalise on the opportunities surrounding solutions based propositions that combine hardware and ict services i look forward to playing an integral role in the development of the business
6012585 i am happy to be meeting the players and i hope that we have a good game
6012586 the result of the game is not important for me on this occasion but the way the players play and how they handle themselves will be very important
6012587 benni showed good leadership as a senior player his experience shone through we played all four afcon qualifiers in june and lacked leadership in attack now we have rediscovered that leadership
6012588 mccarthy was a revelation when he is good he is very good and he was at his best against the hard tackling socceroos
6012589 the players showed their true fighting character i was able to play my best team tonight and got a good result the first half we lost a lot of shape but we got our act together in the second half by playing to our strengths and that is keeping the ball on the ground playing tap tap soccer
6012590 i dont want to say a lot for now but i can tell you that i left on good terms as management and the coaching staff both agreed to my request i am going for trials at one of the gauteng clubs but i cannot divulge the name until more details have been finalised
6012591 the game against mazembe was a tough one they played very well but i can say we had the upper hand throughout if it wasnt for the rain which ruined the pitch wed have beaten them by a much wider margin
6012592 i believe enyimba can go all the way of course if we can beat them in the return leg well be all but through to the semi finals this is not to say i underrate them or anything but i just know it will take more than an inspired tp mazembe to stop enyimba now
6012593 das d rfte die letzten zweifel an der bilanz beseitigen
6012594 we look to win every game although our previous matches have been against two of the top sides in europe
6012595 this is the last time we will be together before the serious stuff starts and its so important to win
6012596 northern ireland will be a tough test and have real talent in
6012597 they beat georgia 4 1 recently and that shows their capabilities
6012598 but were at home and must have belief be positive and take the game to them because thats what well try to do in macedonia
6012599 i will ask the midfielders to play as high up as possible and get into scoring positions barry robson are all capable of getting goals its vital to get into the habit of scoring as world cup qualifying might be tight so a few goals could make the difference
6012600 the game against northern ireland will be a difficult test for us ahead of the world cup qualifying campaign
6012601 like us they had a good euros and were particularly impressive against the eventual winners of the tournament spain
6012602 our members are taking this action very reluctantly they care deeply about the vital services they provide and those who depend on them and we apologise for any disruption
6012603 however members feel they have no choice when the employers offer is effectively a pay cut
6012604 the issues are difficult and complex and need to be carefully thought through
6012605 however as soon as possible we will arrange talks with the
6012606 the slim form of the kawa bathroom faucet is likened to
6012607 we met through mutual friends she was a fan of my show and we decided to meet up and just hit it off
6012608 i thought she was a party girl but she is not she will actually stay home with me which is awesome
6012609 i was asking for a positive light to come into my life and she just walked in
6012610 with another girl you never have to worry about how you look in the morning because we both look sh y and its fine

6012616 the cji k g balakrishnan has written to chief justices of all high courts to consider adopting the apex court judges practice of declaring their assets at the time of their appointment and every year subsequently
6012617 the high court judges may consider adopting a similar resolution in case it does not have a system of judges declaring their assets soon after the assumption of office and regularly updating the declaration made by them
6012618 it is essential for an independent strong and respected judiciary and indispensable for impartial administration of justice
6012619 the pre existing and universally accepted norms guidelines and conventions
6012620 at the time of their appointment every supreme court judge has to declare his assets thereafter if any property is purchased he has to give the information to me in a sealed cover
6012621 this must be the case with high court judges who would furnish the information to the chief justice of the high court concerned
6012622 there are statutory provisions in the us apex court on disclosure of assets by judges there is an urgent need that such provision should be implemented in india too

6012635 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6012636 i am sorry for what i did that 25 year old man i dont think he appreciated the life he was taking that this was a human being
6012637 i feel now at 53 that i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6012638 for my consciences sake i felt the lord had told me to plead guilty at that time and i did
6012639 i had been going through some problems and was very confused and was feeling like a big nothing and a nobody
6012640 it was more about me and not him i was probably mad at myself for my failures
6012641 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6012642 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6012643 the urges built again about doing this and then i flew back on dec 6 and on the 8th i shot mr lennon

6012670 hopeful signs of progress in the rebuilding of the city
6012671 three years ago this facility was completely flooded and every building was damaged or destroyed the president plans to say according to an advance text of his remarks released by the white house
6012672 today jackson barracks is a growing center of community and economic activity in the heart of the lower ninth ward
6012673 the story of your recovery is impressive bush plans to say
6012674 and it is the same story we see playing out across the gulf coast homes businesses and schools are being rebuilt levees are being repaired families and communities are being reconnected and from biloxi to beaumont hope is being restored
6012675 three years ago this month hurricane katrina left one of americas most beloved cities almost completely underwater he will say
6012676 the storm forced 800 000 people across the gulf coast to leave their homes never before had our nation seen natures destruction on such a vast scale and many wondered whether new orleans could ever come back
6012677 three years ago i stood in jackson square and promised that new orleans would return bush will say recalling his second appearance in new orleans after the storm with a speech from the darkened jackson square on sept
6012678 since then the american taxpayers have committed more than 126 billion dollars for disaster response and recovery on the gulf coast
6012679 most of this money is already in the hands of state and local governments and citizens working to rebuild together we are working to make sure that new orleans comes back even stronger safer and more vibrant than it was before the storm
6012680 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered he will say in new orleans
6012681 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress
6012682 we see hopeful signs of progress in our work to protect new orleans from future storms
6012683 we see hopeful signs of progress as housing is restored
6012684 we see hopeful signs of progress in the growth of this areas economy
6012685 we see hopeful signs of progress in the citys improving health care system
6012686 we see hopeful signs of progress in efforts to reduce crime
6012687 we see hopeful signs of progress in the rebirth of new orleans education
6012688 we see hopeful signs of progress in the return of the normal rhythms of life
6012689 for all of these reasons we can look with optimism toward the bright future awaiting new orleans
6012690 they include people right here at jackson barracks the citizen soldiers of the louisiana national guard
6012691 the people responsible for this citys recovery include the men and women in this audience and those seated behind me
6012692 i am inspired by people like daryn dodson who i met at a dinner here last year
6012693 theres no other place like dr martin luther king jr and theres no other place like new orleans
6012694 amal yang pertama kali ditanyai allah pada seorang hamba di hari kiamat nanti adalah sholat bila sholatnya dapat diterima baik maka akan diterima seluruh amalnya dan bila sholatnya ditolak buruk akan tertolak seluruh amalnya
6012695 akan datang suatu masa atas manusia mereka melakukan shalat namun hakikatnya mereka tidak sholat
6012696 yakni orang yang akan mewarisi surga firdaus mereka kekal di dalamnya
6012697 dan mintalah pertolongan kepada allah dengan sabar dan sholat dan sesungguhnya yang demikian itu sungguh berat kecuali bagi orang orang yang khusyu
6012698 sesungguhnya sholat itu mencegah dari perbuatan perbuatan keji dan mungkar

6012704 youll see a couple of commited teams going all out for victory and if they dont come along then theyll be missing out
6012705 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
6012706 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
6012707 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are
6012708 it is hard for us to play to think about football considering what is happening in georgia
6012709 but maybe things are starting to get better and within a few days the russians will have left
6012710 it is hard for us but we have to play the game
6012711 we cannot allow ourselves to feel that because of what is happening that we are not ready for the game we have to play
6012712 the manager has asked us if we are ready because he needs to know
6012713 but we have all said we will play we want to send a message to russia that we can do this
6012714 we also want to show our people and our supporters who will be in the stadium
6012715 i still feel very competitive and i have a massive desire to win every game
6012716 i get upset annoyed frustrated when we dont win if we have not played very well
6012717 i have always played to win whatever game i have played in and i have been very fortunate that most places i have been i have been involved with successful sides
6012718 i would like that to continue until i finish and we are still very much involved in the league which to some extent is in our own hands
6012719 if we had lost last weekend we would have been 20 points behind the top of the league which at this stage of the season would be a hell of a lot
6012720 the skipper asked me if i would a do and i said no problem its worked all right ive got a few but the more important thing is that weve been winning games and thats the main job

6012724 i simply cannot believe what has just happened theres no way this is going to sink in for a long time
6012725 of course this is a dream come true but when you dream its hard to imagine it as a reality but that is what has happened and im in complete shock at the moment
6012726 im completely lost for words i just saw my brothers in the crowd and im so pleased that they were here to see me and it was so good to see them
6012727 im just so proud of myself i always knew this competition was going to be hard and i knew i wasnt the favourite but i always thought i had a good chance of winning

6012729 ive been working for this for four years of my life and it feels like heaven

6012765 there was a lot of pressure because people expected me to win i didnt have an option i had to get the gold
6012766 i keep pinching myself and thinking ill wake up i knew my speed was good and i just had to stay focused
6012767 unfortunately ive only got one chance to win a medal at the olympics which is really sad
6012768 at the worlds i had four events and won three gold medals its tough when the men sprinters have three events and i only have one

6012772 the results for the first half of 2008 showed single digit growth across the print markets in emea with second quarter results showing signs of an economic slowdown which could continue into the rest of the year
6012773 two octopuses help each other in their slapstick escape from the grasps of a stubborn restaurant cook however even after overcoming insurmountable odds to reunite their fight to stay together is not over
6012774 our gain in sales for the second quarter and year to date exceeded our expectations
6012775 the improvement is principally the result of new brand programs within the us and with our sales expansion within southeast asia particularly china for our zipper and trim products the demand for a quality global supply alternative within the zipper market is strong and talon represents the leading solution for a growing number of major brand retailers additionally the refocusing of our sales force that we announced in march is beginning to reflect the synergies we expected within all of our product lines
6012776 however we are beginning to see modest results from our sales and marketing efforts over the last year with a growing interest in and adoption of the technology by new customers
6012777 schamasch phoned me to say this athlete tested positive the process is under way
6012778 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics

6012787 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6012788 sie setzen den namen ihres liebsten ein und werden dann durch ein auswahlmen gef hrt das ihnen immer wieder neue m glichkeiten bietet am ende steht eine sehr pers nliche liebesbotschaft keine ist wie die andere
6012789 klassische animierte gru karten kennt man ja aus dem internet
6012790 aber dass hier ein individueller text in ein video eingebunden wird das ist neu
6012791 wir zeigen dort vier muster liebesbriefe f r verschiedene wichtige anl sse als hilfestellung
6012792 sie sollen als inspiration dienen jeder kann sie nutzen und individuell ver ndern
6012793 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6012794 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6012795 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6012796 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6012797 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6012798 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6012799 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6012800 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6012801 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6012802 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6012803 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6012804 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6012805 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6012806 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6012807 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6012808 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6012809 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6012810 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6012811 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6012812 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6012813 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6012814 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6012815 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6012816 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6012817 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6012818 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6012819 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6012820 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6012821 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6012822 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6012823 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6012824 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6012825 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6012826 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6012827 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6012828 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6012829 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6012830 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6012831 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6012832 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6012833 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6012834 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6012835 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6012836 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6012837 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6012838 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6012839 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6012840 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6012841 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6012842 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6012843 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6012844 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6012845 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6012846 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6012847 reading about people not that much older than me who had gone to jail and suffered beatings in order to liberate a people
6012848 it is as if she is the real daughter i am also a real daughter
6012849 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6012850 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6012851 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6012852 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6012853 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6012854 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6012855 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6012856 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6012857 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6012858 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6012859 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6012860 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6012861 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6012862 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6012863 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6012864 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6012865 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6012866 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6012867 the moment you become conscious of consciousness existence achieves its fulfillment you are so blessed in that moment that you can bless the whole universe
6012868 ought we to concede to men the liberty of conscience
6012869 was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world

6012874 si parlato molto di morte in questi giorni della morte serena di zio carlo filosofo e yogi che forse sapeva la data del suo trapasso guardando il cielo stellato ho pensato che magari morir anchio in mesopotamia e che non me ne importa un baffo tutto fa parte di un gigantesco divertente minestrone cosmico e tanto vale affidarsi al vento a questa brezza fresca da occidente e al tepore della terra che mi riscalda il culo lindispensabile culo che finora mi ha sempre accompagnato
6012875 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6012876 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6012877 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea

6012883 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6012884 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6012885 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6012886 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6012887 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6012888 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6012889 we only want to use chemotherapy where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help use determine that
6012890 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer
6012891 the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatment this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives

6012920 last year i thought you know it was good it was good tv what we had going as the fedex cup wore on there were a lot of good story lines there too
6012921 with tiger out you know its just a great opportunity for an old guy here to actually steal some money in that fedex cup so thats what were after now
6012922 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6012923 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6012924 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm

6012927 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously

6012930 discover the ultra secret business strategy that has been used to reach the top by some of the biggest corporations and business owners in the world
6012931 a sense of direction emerged which was largely but not universally agreed and which should translate into greater cohesion within the anglican communion giving it stronger boundaries and a stronger sense of identity
6012932 we went into the lambeth conference in a wait and see mode and we came out of it with some encouragement but still waiting
6012933 the importance of the role of the episcopacy the need for authority in the church and a concern for fidelity with the churchs tradition throughout the ages
6012934 subtly suggesting that we bring individuals into the catholic church some may come but what he was asking was that anglicans be attentive to the treasures that lie within their tradition as well as ours
6012935 the situation within the anglican communion in general has become markedly more complex

6012939 the uk has a rigorous system in place for managing child sex offenders which is among the toughest in the world
6012940 the changes im announcing today will strengthen that even further i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
6012941 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
6012942 i will legislate for these measures as soon as possible
6012943 these measures are a crucial step forward and should help clamp down on sex tourism
6012944 we have been consistently saying that when there is clear evidence a sex offender poses a risk the authorities must have effective powers to stop them from going abroad
6012945 but if they do travel there must be better systems in place to monitor and track their movements
6012946 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6012947 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
6012948 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
6012949 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
6012950 footballers dont realise just how important a great haircut is if you want to be successful as soon as i got my perm i was better than maradona and pele put together ive told michael if he wants to regain his form then he needs to think about sorting out his tresses hes had a sensible haircut for too long now if he wants that new contract he had better get those curlers out and get a killer perm like mine
6012951 we have often thought michael needs a bit of an image change and we will certainly look at a keegan style perm i know michaels childhood heroes were carlos valderama and rene higuita so i wouldnt rule anything out i do admit that his current haircut is a bit shit and that keegan does make a vaild point for once

6013163 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6013164 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6013165 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6013166 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6013167 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6013168 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6013169 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6013176 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6013177 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6013178 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6013179 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6013180 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6013181 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6013182 this is a planning took where all things are going
6013183 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6013184 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6013185 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6013186 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6013187 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6013188 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6013189 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6013190 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6013191 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6013192 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6013193 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6013194 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6013195 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6013196 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6013197 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6013198 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6013199 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6013200 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6013201 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6013202 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6013203 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6013204 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6013205 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6013206 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6013207 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6013208 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6013209 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6013210 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6013211 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6013212 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6013213 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6013214 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6013215 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6013216 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6013217 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6013218 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6013219 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6013220 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6013221 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6013222 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6013223 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6013224 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6013225 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6013226 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6013227 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6013228 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6013229 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6013230 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6013231 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6013232 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6013233 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6013234 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6013235 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6013236 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6013237 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6013238 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6013239 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6013240 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6013241 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6013242 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6013243 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6013244 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6013245 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6013246 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6013247 with drag artists and hot male dancers a first class producer and a gifted costume designer and a choreographer who really puts them through their paces you have the recipe for an extravaganza that will change the face of the genre forever the repertoire spans numerous decades and divas from both stage and screen keeping the show thoroughly up to date taking drag from the doldrums to centre stage its the drag show of the year
6013248 jesus another motley crew she thought better tone the dirty jokes down a bit the old ones dont like too much smut although the younger crowd just lap it up

6013250 think youre so special hey but youre just a blonde bimbo from nowhere baby nothing special about you
6013251 girls were finding it more difficult as the years passed
6013252 dunno why i keep on doing this its a helluva life and keeping up with the others is getting more and more difficult some of them are nearly twenty years younger i hate these new singers with their ghastly voices no skills no training just belt it out
6013253 shoes dont fit theyre only held together with elastic bands and the blisters on my toes and heels are bleeding my scrotum is giving me gyp with the tight costumes punters always want to see our legs and keep hoping something will slip and then theyll really get their moneys worth but were professionals we know how to wear the stage clothes and how to tuck everything away nothing ever goes wrong six shows a week two on sundays and then back to selling car parts on mondays its bloody murder but i gotta do it
6013254 forget the fluffs for the next three months theres no need to worry about little tommys private school fees i know theyll keep me doing this as long as i still walk in these bloody spike heels
6013255 damit hat die steiermark seine schlusslichtposition abgegeben so khol weiter wobei auch die langj hrige forderung des sozialsprechers der steirischen volkspartei lt abg

6013257 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6013258 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6013259 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6013260 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6013261 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
6013262 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
6013263 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
6013264 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6013265 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6013266 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6013267 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6013268 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6013269 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6013270 this is the seventh year of the merchant city festival which has seen it flourish into one of the most exciting and vibrant multi arts platforms in scotland
6013271 this has enabled audiences from far and wide to get a real taste of what is happening in scottish arts and culture
6013272 our programme encompasses scotlands national companies and selected programmes from the magners glasgow international comedy festival the national review of live art and bafta scotland
6013273 from mainland europe we also showcase selections from acclaimed festivals in france spain and austria
6013274 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
6013275 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
6013276 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
6013277 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
6013278 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
6013279 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
6013280 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
6013281 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
6013282 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
6013283 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
6013284 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
6013285 slot cut into upper drive platter and white tape on center drive platter provides a slot that when illuminated by the leds will represent a clock hand minute hand is represented by blue light hour hand is represented by red light and the second hand is represented by purple both blue and red on at the same time infrared beam sensor and drilled index hole in lower drive platter three micro switches to set hours minutes and seconds

6013291 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6013292 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6013293 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6013294 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6013295 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6013296 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6013297 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6013298 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6013299 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6013301 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
6013302 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
6013303 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
6013304 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
6013305 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
6013306 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
6013307 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
6013308 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
6013309 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
6013310 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
6013311 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
6013312 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
6013313 in my opinion whole foods underestimated the uk market its core business natural and organic foods is a category commonly found in the mainstream supermarkets and generally at a lower price whole foods lack of differentiation high prices and relatively limited brand exposure are true weaknesses it needs to address

6013317 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6013318 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6013351 der freiheitliche familienverband begr t im prinzip die vorschl ge f r eine steuerliche absetzbarkeit von kinderbetreuungskosten
6013352 voraussetzung f r eine solche ma nahme ist allerdings dass gleichzeitig die steuerliche benachteiligung der familien die ihre kinder selbst betreuen durch ein familiensplitting bei der lohnsteuer nach franz sischem vorbild beseitigt wird
6013353 als isolierte ma nahme w re die steuerliche absetzbarkeit von kinderbetreuungskosten lediglich eine weitere diskriminierung der m tter die ihre kinder selbst betreuen und erziehen und wird von der fp daher in dieser form entschieden abgelehnt
6013354 kinderbetreuung durch die eigene mutter muss mindestens genauso bewertet und anerkannt werden wie fremdbetreuung
6013355 ausgaben f r arztbesuche medikamente oder spitalsaufenthalte machen davon aber nur ein drittel aus
6013356 zwei drittel der krankheitskosten entstehen durch krankenst nde oder erwerbsunf higkeit als folge zu sp ter behandlung
6013357 die medizin hat heute innovative therapien zu bieten die in das krankheitsgeschehen eingreifen und patienten so eine dauerhafte teilnahme am erwerbsleben erm glichen k nnen
6013358 gerade in zeiten knapper kassenbudgets ist die effektive behandlung chronischer erkrankungen nicht nur medizinisch notwendig sondern auch konomisch sinnvoll
6013359 auf dauer k nnen wir es uns nicht leisten dass menschen mit rheumatoider arthritis vorzeitig aus dem erwerbsleben ausscheiden m ssen jeder krankenstandstag ist einer zuviel und somit muss es auch das ziel sein diese zu minimieren
6013360 gelingt uns eine zehnprozentige senkung aller krankenst nde k nnte die sterreichische wirtschaft um bis zu 650 millionen entlastet werden
6013361 die rheumatoide arthritis ist in diesem zusammenhang nicht nur hinsichtlich der massiven belastung f r die betroffenen sondern auch angesichts der volkswirtschaftlichen kosten ein krankheitsfeld dem entsprechende aufmerksamkeit gewidmet werden muss
6013362 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6013363 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6013364 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6013365 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6013366 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6013367 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6013368 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6013369 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6013370 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6013371 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6013372 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6013373 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6013374 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6013375 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6013376 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6013377 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6013378 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6013379 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6013380 im wahlkampf auf dem r cken der jugendlichen politisches kleingeld zu wechseln ist unfair und daher abzulehnen
6013381 es bleibt kein jugendlicher auf der strecke denn jeder jugendliche enth lt vom ams einen ausbildungsplatz
6013382 au erdem ist mit ende juni ist das sozialpartnerpaket zur jugendbesch ftigung in kraft getreten dieses paket wurde von allen sozialpartnern also auch gb und ak gemeinsam beschlossen und enth lt eine ausbildungsgarantie die lehrlingsf rderung wurde zudem auf eine neue basis gestellt und ist jetzt flexibler und qualit tsorientierter
6013383 die fp spricht sich neuerlich gegen ein humanit res bleiberecht aus dies ist v llig berfl ssig da es ohnehin ein asylrecht gibt wer in seiner heimat politisch religi s und ethnisch motivierter verfolgung ausgesetzt ist hat f r die dauer der drohenden verfolgung auch anspruch auf asyl wenn diese voraussetzungen nicht erf llt werden m ssen die asylwerber rasch abgeschoben werden die erf llung der forderungen nach einem humanit ren bleiberecht w rde scheinasylanten f r den missbrauch eines systems belohnen welches ausschlie lich schutzbed rftigen dienen darf
6013384 besonders bedenklich ist der st ndige flirt der ober sterreichischen vp mit den gr nen um sie in dieser sache zu best rken die ober sterreichische vp soll sich endlich f r die sterreicher einsetzen und nicht f r scheinasylanten die schwarze innenministerin ist zudem aufgefordert die notwendigen abschiebungen endlich rasch durchzuf hren an ihren taten wird sie am wahltag von den sterreichern gemessen und nicht an versuchter rechter rhetorik zudem muss das asylwesen reformiert werden um den wirtschaftszweig der rund um den missbrauch des systems entstanden ist einzud mmen h rtef lle konnten nur entstehen weil die verfahren zu lange gedauert haben und schlampig mit den gesetzen der republik umgegangen wird
6013385 die fp fordert die rasche abwicklung der asylverfahren und die unterbringung der asylwerber in gesicherten zentren sowie die abschiebung von verurteilten asylwerbern nach dem verb en der haftstrafe bzw die sofortige abschiebung wenn ein verb en der haftstrafe im heimatland m glich ist die ober sterreichische bev lkerung wird sich von der wahlkampf rhetorik der innenministerin und den flirts der vp ober sterreich mit den gr nen nicht beeindrucken lassen sondern die fp st rken die sich als einzige partei f r die sicherheit der sterreichischen bev lkerung einsetzt

6013392 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6013393 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6013394 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso

6013396 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso

6013398 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6013405 it was a great night his late wife deirdre was there too she was caring for him at the time as he was in poor health but unfortunately she passed away a few months later one of the girls who used to work in the hotel actually used to babysit for ronnie and deirdre she looked after their daughter cliona ronnie was a tremendous musician and well remember fondly his gigs in castlebar
6013406 people used to come from all over to see them we were one of the first pubs in the west that they played in
6013407 they were supposed to come and play in the pub but they got sidetracked in galway and ended up going on the beer there to make up for missing the gig they came back another night and played for free
6013408 there is a real risk that many may regard it as just another political controversy that has no relevance to them
6013409 dramatically reduces the prospects for people of getting planning permission in the location of their choice
6013410 this is already causing huge stress and anxiety to many existing applicants it will similarly restrict lifestyle options for many more who have not yet applied for permissions
6013411 i am appealling to everyone to acquaint themselves with the issues involved and to make their views known by making submissions to the council
6013412 the novena is more than just about travellers it is about the 100 000 plus crowd that make the annual pilgrimage every year
6013413 thankfully there has been no trouble this year i hope that a resolution can be found to this problem
6013414 i feel that this year is stage one of the resolution but it will have to happen in stages this is a positive step in the right direction
6013415 the weather has been atrocious the outdoor processions are a huge part of the novena i hope that the weather does get better for the remainder of the novena
6013416 going on a pilgrimage is part of our sacred psyche its part of our heritage people make an effort to come to a sacred place
6013417 rosetta is convinced he strayed on numerous occasions she was still with balthazar when he began the affair with miller

6013422 the fact is john is not the man jen thought he was
6013423 once again she feels she has been mislead by a man she cared deeply about only to be left disappointed jen and john made a pact not to go public about their relationship when they were together and now they are apart he has gone and shot his mouth off at the first opportunity

6013426 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6013427 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6013428 the targeting of me and the detention of my sons will hurt the political process and national reconciliation
6013429 targeting national reconciliation the political process and democracy in the country
6013430 special cells is the only party that will be authorized to carry arms
6013431 all other groups even those belonging to al sadr trend will be banned from carrying out any military actions however this does not mean that these groups will be banned from such actions if provocative operations are carried out by the security forces in some regions
6013432 most al mahdi army elements will be directed toward ideological awareness and cultural resistance the remaining part which we call resistance cells and which are authorized to carry arms will pursue the duty of military resistance
6013433 military resistance will remain as long as iraq is occupied
6013434 most anti us operations have been carried out by the al mahdi army supporters however the recent clashes with the iraqi forces were sparked by infiltrators some of who work for the occupation forces to distort the image of imam army while others work for political parties that are known in the political arena and whose goal is to distort the image of sadrists and the resistance these people want to say that the al mahdi army is breaching order attacking citizens and the security forces and working toward shaking up security
6013435 continued measures are being imposed against these parties starting with the decision to freeze the al mahdi army this decision has helped halt their activities and has forced them to leave the army
6013436 this agreement still holds at least as far as we the sadrist trend are concerned as for the government we regretfully say that it has breached the agreement several times it has not fulfilled many points and has not even started to implement others
6013437 despite our initiative to include all governorates within this agreement the government has showed no compliance in this regard
6013438 arrests were unjustifiable friday sermon deliverers deliver one or two religious sermons the only subject that such sermons may raise is the rejection of the agreement reached with the united states many parties other than the sadrist trend agree on this issue because this agreement includes items that harm iraq accordingly imams are being arrested even while delivering their sermons or while performing prayers some of these imams have not even discussed the agreement and others were arrested beaten and humiliated even before arriving at their mosques like what happened in basra
6013439 it is gratifying to all ctk staff and investors that ctk data management products are so widely used
6013440 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble
6013441 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6013442 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6013443 young children and adults with serious dental issues are being made to suffer because of consistent underfunding of this state scheme
6013444 medical card holders are once again being treated like second class citizens they are just as entitled to dental services the hse is citing every kind of law except the equality legislation this issue is really about equal access to essential services
6013445 children are now being assessed by private dentists who identify them as needing treatment when they go through the public system the dentists there tell them they dont need it thats just another way of limiting the service
6013446 mr ganley has failed to keep his word maybe he realised the high intellectual fire power that would be facing him the debate with senator eugene regan and mep jim higgins would certainly have been a test of his mettle
6013447 of course i must take the word of his staff that he has commitments in america but i think its very telling that he feels his time would be better spent there than here in mayo debating the future of european relations post lisbon the offer of an alternative libertas member is pretty mean ingless we already have people of the calibre of ulick mcevaddy and joe noonan representing the anti lisbon side
6013448 they are two leaders of our time whose contribution to the civil rights movement in the north has not been fully recognised
6013449 it was reassuring that our group hit a good bit above the national average in maths especially seeing as the fail rate in maths this year was worryingly high we have had no tears so far all the students are leaving with smiles on their faces
6013450 the leaving cert is the best stepping stone to the rest of their lives and a plc can make the jump a little easier many of our students will be going on to the universities and in particular the its some have already made up their minds about what they want to do i had a student ring this morning looking for his results by phone as he is already in the navy
6013451 93 per cent of our 80 pupils will be heading to third level come september and those who arent are bound for successful careers also
6013452 many of our results this year have been exceptional with our student of the year james farrell taking away 7as
6013453 we have had plenty of results in the high 500s and our pass classes did exceptionally well also i was delighted to see that our lca students made such a success of the programme with endless distinctions and merits
6013454 primary teaching and nursing is the biggest pull this year for our students with a considerable amount having applied to the university of limerick
6013455 this was the first year we tried agricultural science and even though it was meant for the fifth year students just beginning the leaving cert cycle sixth year students took it up for their final year and produced amazing results
6013456 you have to feel sorry for the pupils coming in as many of them are very emotional as they know it can be make or break though they should realise that it is not the end of the world luckily this year was a very positive year for the school we have a few going on to do primary teaching and it would seem alongside the various universities gmit is a very popular choice this year
6013457 all the science subjects produced high results and english especially was a very pleasant surprise
6013458 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
6013459 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
6013460 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
6013461 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

6013478 at first i didnt want her to be the kumari id be sad without her so i hid her upstairs but they insisted and took her and said you shouldnt talk like that
6013479 they told us her horoscope matched exactly so we couldnt say no my mother in law said something bad might happen if we didnt let her go and it was good for the family name so although we were sad we let her go
6013480 if she was with me at home it would be so much fun we would play together
6013481 i would not like to be separated from my parents and i wouldnt have any friends in school i can go to school and i can go outside as well
6013482 the key deprivation is she cannot live with her mother or father she must live in a temple without them as a child you have a right to grow up in your own community with your own family as a kumari you cannot you cannot play with your friends because you are a goddess

6013607 if you remove our cables you had better move all the power from the area no one can have it if we are not allowed to have electricity
6013608 there is generally rampant theft of electricity and illegal connections in the sea cow lake area as fast as we replace these cables they are stolen again but unless we police 24 hours a day it will happen wherever there are informal settlements where poor people have not been provided with electricity the temptation to connect illegally is often too great for some
6013609 ultimately the only way to solve electricity theft is to provide everyone with power in their homes but we are improving our patrols and will definitely not sit on our hands and do nothing but unfortunately as cape town has success with these gangs they will move up the coast and as we have success they will move to other areas arrests are the only way of stopping it we will definitely curb it

6013616 i finished second on the european circuit and third in the world championships so there are no new faces for me here in beijing

6013655 we have been closely observing the changes to the modern media landscape and feel that emerging media trends are becoming too significant to ignore
6013656 as a result we have evolved to include digital and social media in our core services and have released some revolutionary new products to coincide with the changes
6013657 so many websites have been poorly designed and do not perform well or at all in google yahoo and other searches that is severely hindering the online success of those businesses we can fix this quickly and cost effectively
6013658 at sticky we believe so strongly in the benefits of good seo that we now bundle it into all of our new website designs
6013659 in an increasingly fragmented media landscape we owe it to our clients to look at every available option to identify the most effective marketing options

6013680 oftentimes academic researchers will get government grants to do things that youve got to wonder why are they doing that
6013681 theres plenty of research out there that doesnt need to be done and why somebody funds it is one of the great mysteries of life
6013682 its congress job to set guidelines for how nih and other agencies spend taxpayer money and then exercise oversight to ensure that those guidelines are being followed
6013683 however over the last several years congress has neglected its oversight function
6013684 its difficult for congress to criticize nih for wasteful grants when congress itself is earmarking billions of dollars every year on similarly wasteful pet projects
6013685 certainly some of these questions are more significant than they are made to appear when theyre poked fun at

6013688 a rumbling stomach cannot be assumed to mean your body needs food
6013689 your stomach speaks an ancient language so it requires some thoughtful interpretation before you rush to conclusions or the fridge
6013690 it will also rumble after eating at which time the churning is about digestion not ingestion
6013691 finally a very appetizing aroma can elicit an appetite response that has nothing to do with hunger per se the responses can range from the proverbial salivation to stomach rumbling but this does not mean your body needs food
6013692 what you are hearing is the movement of your intestines and the passage of gas through them a totally normal process

6013702 what has bothered me in trying watch this is the seemingly idiotic coverage by nbc where these important events dont start until 10 or 11 at night while prime time is filled with things like beach volleyball but if you are already making the decision to air them at 10pm midnight on the east why cant you air them between 7pm and 9pm in california i dont think the networks would show the presidential debates live in new york and taped in california they recognize that people want to see the events live the same holds true for the big events at the olympics bad bad form to nbc

6013717 mart nez solicita a la instituci n foral que d los pasos necesarios para desarrollar una distribuci n de linux propia que sirva de soporte en el futuro a los ordenadores de las administraciones de bizkaia
6013718 pertama tama saya akan beritahu kalian apa yang saya tidak akan lakukan saya tidak akan menyerahkan kebijakan energi kepada cawapres yang tidak mengetahui apa yang ia perbuat jelas obama cawapres saya ada seorang eksekutif partai
6013719 tidak seharusnya aset negara apalagi yang strategis dijual kepada orang luar

6013727 this perfectly compliments our roots in citizen journalism and curated content from our motionmaker community
6013728 when i first started the sustainable times i went after that market which pretty much had to be developed a lot of businesses were becoming interested but it wasnt mainstream as much as it is now
6013729 i noticed when i was here that there was a lot of awareness for anything that had to do with sustainability
6013730 theres a huge farmers market theres a lot of effort going into renewable energy and so on but there was no publication here covering it consistently
6013731 and ive kept some strategic locations for myself like capital brewery and the roxbury tavern and the malt house
6013732 theres 24 hours in a day and somehow it always all gets done
6013733 there are businesses that used to advertise with me that dont exist anymore that went out of business i can see the recession the economic situation as well in my advertising so far we are still going up
6013734 you know right away who the businesses are that identify with the whole sustainability ethos because they advertise in that paper and that is what supports the paper
6013735 if people get the notion that this is all about democrats storming the barricades that democrats want to run the whole show well that offends wisconsin people
6013736 youve got to temper the partisanship a bit wisconsin people know that republicans screwed up when they had it all the white house the senate the house of representatives and they remember that democrats screwed some things up when we had it all under clinton after 1992 people want to know how youre going to handle things if you have this great victory and they want to know you will be responsible with all this power if you dont communicate about it right if you dont signal that you can work in a bipartisan manner there can be a serious backfire
6013737 theres this wave of belief on the democratic side that this will be one of the greatest years of all time and it might well be but getting all wrapped up with the idea that youre going to win easily can be very dangerous especially in wisconsin
6013738 democrats think obama will have a good senate to work with a good house to work with and that this will give a democratic candidate space to do what he wants obama may feel uncomfortable talking about bipartisanship in that context but he should i know for sure that wisconsin voters want to hear that even if the democrats win it all they will still include republicans in the project
6013739 what i have found is that is that you can be ideological whether it be standing strong on civil liberties or opposing the war in iraq or fighting for universal health care and work very easily with the other party
6013740 it is actually easier to be ideological and bipartisan than to be a partisan
6013741 if youre partisan obviously by definition you see it as a betrayal to work across party lines why are you working with this republican why are you working with that republican now obamas very nature is bipartisan hes very good on that in terms of his tone but i feel this vibe from a lot of democrats that theyre thinking well you know were going to take over were going to run the show we dont want you working with republicans thats not what wisconsin people want to hear in fact i would say thats the one thing that would get them to vote for mccain
6013742 the case is so clear on the merits that obama wants to take us in a better direction than mccain that i think thats the case you should make
6013743 dont attack the other man dont say somebodys disloyal if they say something nice about john mccain its just really clear that the right person to move the country in the direction of real change at this point is barack obama its an easy case
6013744 so i wouldnt get caught up in all this other stuff unfortunately some people are partisan and get all uptight about the election but that doesnt work if you want to appeal to wisconsin voters dont talk about whats wrong about mccain talk about who is going to help really solve the fundamental problems when it comes to health care and a balanced energy solution and jobs obamas case is so obviously more compelling than mccains rest your case on that make that the issue
6013745 its attributable to strong value in the project and the citys strong support
6013746 thats a win win in that we saved on the project cost and the residents had a chance to earn some cash
6013747 many of the residents used the self moving monies and rent credits to catch up on their rents
6013748 so its ok to stray since she wasnt vomiting from chemo
6013749 the harsh reality is that for breast cancer there is no cure theres just what we call ned no evidence of disease its always lurking
6013750 i hate to think of all the women ive met who deal with body image issues and now with the edwards affair theyve got to worry that hubby will do the same thing this is going to be a real trigger
6013751 caregiving is hard the pressure can become overwhelming and there arent enough templates for how to deal with it in a healthy and holistic way when the pressure becomes overwhelming too many caregivers will get sick or do the john edwards thing it becomes an escape hatch
6013752 there have been an awful lot of partners thrown into the lake
6013753 ive never seen a situation where cancer and nothing else caused the relationship to splinter
6013754 a womans body is drying up which can make it very difficult to experience sexual intimacy
6013755 a lot of women have all kinds of fears that their partners will look elsewhere but if couples work together they can maintain their relationships
6013756 when you lose a breast you lose your feminine identity for a time
6013757 i found myself a rare man who was not at all deterred by the missing a breast thing
6013758 he always makes me feel beautiful so it was all for the best
6013759 the study was a good one to look at an ancient building and see what you could do
6013760 but now the operating budget is so bad that the whole thing is on hold
6013761 it fills up within a day the students have a tremendous appetite for sustainability
6013762 they took that model and started changing the design of the building
6013763 the glass in the building is very old and loses a lot of heat in winter they improved the economy of the building quite a bit
6013764 the recommendations were all things that would help the library and make it better for the environment but a lot of it did not have a cost benefit so i put forward the things that could have a monetary benefit
6013765 it shows what improvements the library might put through and how long it would take to break even after that it is just savings there is a great opportunity for improvement there
6013766 they get a lot of visitors and the local community gets a lot out of the library
6013767 we didnt find anything that said it didnt deserve to be improved there are a lot of little things that you can do and the library would be a really great spot to show that
6013768 more efficient because you dont heat the water 24 hours a day only when the faucet comes on
6013769 there would be read outs at different places in the building so people could see exactly what effect they are having on energy use
6013770 a building is something tangible that people can see think about and picture in their minds
6013771 and it was a pretty split community speaking out on both sides in favor and being opposed
6013772 we are on the same page now were really changing our focus to one of really spending more time on student achievement
6013773 this is a very important transitional moment and i hope that the community gets the change in conversation thats happened here because its really a historic moment in how weve looked at referendums in this district
6013774 this is a good time for a referendum because youve got a lot of people with good consciences going to the polls and not bullet voters who you get in a spring referendum
6013775 when we have an election in the fall of the year with the numbers of people who are interested in voting for president you have people who have a conscience toward schools
6013776 i wouldnt put much money on the table to say that it would pass
6013777 i think they have an awful lot of work to do in order to communicate to the public with reliable valid data that shows what the need is theyve got a huge hill to climb in my opinion in terms of gaining trust and respect of the community because that has eroded enormously
6013778 i do think they are making progress and ive been encouraged that theyre focused on improving achievement of students and better fiscal responsibility of things
6013779 i just felt personally horrible about that budget and that was not even 8 2 million
6013780 theres a big burnout rate amongst the special education teachers
6013781 i know a lot who have gone back to school to get their regular education certification because they say the paperwork and the pressure its just too much and we dont want to lose those teachers who have been in our system and understand how the madison system works and how successful its been
6013782 i cant imagine in my wildest dreams that dan and erik are going to come up with 8 2 million in cuts that arent going to be devastating
6013783 we road from our milwaukee office to our madison office as a way to kick off our presence there bring together and network with business leaders from both cities and promote sustainability
6013784 it was so well received that we decided to make it an annual event with different madison and milwaukee charities every year
6013785 ive got clients in the chicago area who make a special point of coming up to madison so they can ride their bikes
6013786 its a great selling point for the region and a great way to network
6013787 we hadnt been riding much in the last month so i was little worried
6013788 but its not too hilly between milwaukee and madison so were able to keep up
6013789 i tried to sit in the back and do some networking but the ride was going so hard i didnt have much time to chat
6013790 id say half of the fittings we do now are for women
6013791 as you can see there is still a lot of crap remaining
6013792 sickening and one of the greatest tragedies to hit the bassett neighborhood in recent years
6013793 the green house is where the young lady was murdered
6013794 it was quite a different neighborhood back in the 1990s as far as who the residents were and the crime
6013795 now there are more people who are invested in the neighborhood and are more prone to take action when they see things they dont like
6013796 we worked with several property owners to take care of some of the underlying issues that were causing problems in the area
6013797 it was kind of like intensive therapy until we knew they could manage on their own
6013798 we had the murder right down the street and there are drug deals going down all the time right across the street
6013799 burglaries and drunken episodes are the most persistent crimes and the burglaries are targeted at the student rentals they just arent as hard to get into
6013800 my general sense is that other crimes havent gone up lately i think there is a greater awareness because of zimmermann
6013801 we did have a rough spell there and everybody pulled together
6013802 but otherwise ive been here for 40 years and weve had one break in but have never been robbed
6013803 why would people invest 400 000 in a condo down here if they didnt think it was a safe place to live
6013804 how can you go wrong buying property four blocks from the capitol
6013805 derelicts would go over there buy liquor and sit around on the porches and cause trouble
6013806 its kind of exciting in a terrifying sort of way
6013807 our family is a tiny little piece of what was intended to happen down here you can see the gentrification going on
6013808 i had my doors locked before and i have them locked now
6013809 participation in the electoral process is very important both for our members and for public schools
6013810 the margin that the republican majority has is slim and it looks like there is the possibility for that house to flip
6013811 if it does we believe we may have people who are more interested in the reform agenda that we believe is important
6013812 there has been less than a willingness to look at the kind of reform we believe is necessary
6013813 it gets more fierce as it gets closer and other groups weigh in
6013814 weac and the democrats have opened the floodgates for special interest spending levels unlike anything wisconsin residents have ever seen
6013815 if successful assembly democratic leadership intends to reward them with hundreds of taxpayer dollars for every dollar spent buying off their candidates
6013816 its curious to hear republicans talk about special interest money given the vast outspending theyll have from wmc and other corporate interests
6013817 if theyre implying that anyone who spends money on an election is going to get favors i assume theyre going to provide a list of what wmc has asked for
6013818 tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks for big business over the years probably hundreds of millions if you add it all up
6013819 so now theyre setting the bar for 2008 and i wouldnt be surprised if some of the right leaning groups start looking at that and thinking we have to counter that
6013820 this is certainly consistent with weacs pattern they have weighed in very very heavily in state legislative races and i would expect this fall they will spend with abandon
6013821 pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani is a good man he has the right intentions i hope he gets the tools of control that is for the pakistani government to decide and that is for us and the international community to help him with afghanistan will go out of its way
6013822 our relationship with india in the same manner is not counterproductive to pakistan
6013823 our findings suggest that people can make accurate inferences about others personality traits and behavioural dispositions based on certain signals conveyed by the face
6013824 es wird zeit mich wieder voll auf die karriere zu konzentrieren
6013825 ich bin ehrlich und sehr direkt das macht s nicht immer einfach mancher l sst sich eben schnell einsch chtern
6013826 aber ich werd mich deshalb ganz sicher f r niemanden ndern
6013827 stimmt als ich wieder blond wurde dachte ich oje die leute werden dich zerrei en jetzt bist du f r sie eine von den blondinen mit denen ich berhaupt nichts zu tun haben will
6013828 jetzt wirds zeit mich wieder voll auf die karriere zu konzentrieren schlie lich hab ich gro es gl ck und konnte mein hobby zum beruf machen
6013829 it felt like those who were christian were favored and those who were not were almost not acknowledged
6013830 a menina era maga e tinha muitas revistas debaixo da cama
6013831 uma menina de sete gatos ou o saldo de euler
6013832 the 50 heller coin is a historical symbol and it has a very long history but the shops dont want to accept them they even refuse them
6013833 its no big deal i think we have worse problems
6013834 depending on how many hellers we receive we may proclaim a tender for selling the metal
6013835 incorporating the multifunctional card into public transportation is a logical step which will mean better services for prague residents as well as visitors
6013836 many european and world cities have electronic fares as an integral part of their public transportation systems
6013837 i hope people will welcome this new option which will ease their access to public services
6013838 in this first phase of implementation there may not be a reduction in the number of illegal riders
6013839 but in connection with the possible restrictions of a metro with turnstiles we can expect a rapid decrease right now we are in a stage of discussions with prague integrated transport coordinator ropid about usage and possible effects
6013840 hotels restaurants shops and travel agencies are experiencing the biggest crisis since the 2002 floods we are too expensive for foreign tourists
6013841 services still cost the same in crowns or are becoming more expensive in some areas price wise we have unwittingly turned into a luxury destination
6013842 i dont want the dam either but ive talked with lawyers and the best we can hope for is postponing the construction some 20 years
6013843 then it will be built anyway because its been labeled as in the public interest so the state can force locals to make way for the dam against their will
6013844 at first the whole village was supposed to go but now we are talking only about a smaller dam that would cover only two thirds of our area
6013845 we have succeeded in pushing forward the smaller option with many natural anti flood measures we saved 69 homes while maintaining a high level of water retention capability
6013846 by 2016 villages will be protected completely against small floods and construction on the dam itself will begin the dam will protect more than 170 000 people in 55 towns and villages below it
6013847 all the decisions were made behind closed doors and no one asked our opinion we were simply told wed have to move
6013848 we have yet to see any plans for the dam or options that we could choose from
6013849 i am trying to ensure that this village has a future and that my children and grandchildren can grow up and live here just like me
6013850 every cloud has a silver lining even if we cant win we could be compensated in such a way that would ensure the future of our village
6013851 if we could get permission and state support for public projects i am sure our citizens would rethink their position and see the benefits it would bring
6013852 our forefathers lived here for hundreds of years and survived all the floods because they knew where to build however in krnov which will be protected by the dam they built a new shopping mall after the 1997 floods right next to the river instead of flood barriers now they want it protected and dont care that their bad decision is destroying the lives of many innocent people
6013853 they are trying to buy us off but no amount of money can repay what we are going to lose
6013854 this has been our home and life for many generations and even though many now live elsewhere the whole family always returns here for christmas and birthdays after the floods in 1997 we had to rebuild our house almost from scratch the state gave us 10 000 k but we had to spend millions now they want to take our homes and sink them again
6013855 villagers were unhappy with being forced to live in a city and some of them decided to come and live here with us and start a new life for them this is the second time a dam has threatened their lives
6013856 has a lot of camber changes which make set up quite hard
6013857 its a great track though and it can produce some great racing
6013858 ive enjoyed it because i am leading the championship my bike is working well and it comes after a great great race
6013859 this is the same for every track we have gone to so far this season
6013860 i think we now have a good base setup for the bike and therefore i trust in jeremy and my guys
6013861 i got a good result last year after a hard battle with loris capirossi so it all looks good for a strong performance from the whole garage
6013862 brno has been a successful track for me and one i really like to race at
6013863 i won there in 2006 and would really like to do that again
6013864 weve moved the lower and middle levels of production abroad
6013865 the situation is not good the classical textile producers have practically disappeared
6013866 the critical level is about 23 and 24 k euro
6013867 if it gets worse or even if it remains the same in the next six months more production will be moved abroad
6013868 we have our people do quality control in these countries
6013869 its our fabric our patents and our machines theyre just working for us
6013870 the ministry does not consider the outsourcing of domestic production as a major problem for the czech economy
6013871 partial delocalization will become more common as czech companies mature the ministry does not expect any great movement of domestic companies out of the country
6013872 we have an opportunity in that we have two universities focused on textile and clothing production from a technical point of view
6013873 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6013874 these growing numbers are really alarming and we are already thinking about better prevention
6013875 people often do not pay attention to local dangers such as extreme weather conditions
6013876 they often ignore warnings and consider themselves immune to danger because they are on holiday and having fun tourists should know their limits whether they are on the beach hiking through mountains or just driving a car
6013877 even though czechs can now call on any eu consulate in case of need we established three extra offices in the former yugoslavia as that still is the most popular tourist destination among czechs and several others throughout europe
6013878 issuing a temporary passport is easy but when dealing with fatalities there is much more work we have to handle the bereaved as well as arrange for the repatriation of lonely tourists when someone dies abroad relatives often have no idea what to do and it is up to us to provide them with relevant information and give all assistance
6013879 it is only logical for more people to die abroad if more time is spent traveling
6013880 we will also see more pensioners traveling in the czech republic 10 percent of holidays are sold to older people while in the eu it is 18 percent in the near future the czech republic will rise to the european standard however that will also mean more deaths abroad
6013881 many people travel abroad without a travel agency and do not realize the risks
6013882 each year someone sets out to sea on a floating mattress and gets carried away by strong winds if you go with a travel agent he should provide you with weather warnings and oversee your safety
6013883 the legacy of the holocaust as a phenomenon is so vivid and so urgent that it cannot be forgotten
6013884 we have been dealing with these types of restitutions since the 1990s and there have been a lot of ups and downs
6013885 throughout the course of our research we discovered that no one had dealt with the fate of looted art on a european scale
6013886 obviously there is still a good number of people who have not received anything neither property nor compensation
6013887 it takes a lot of time to gather documents and in some cases they were destroyed or scattered throughout europe people have turned to us and whenever we can we advise them but we dont have the capabilities to advise them all
6013888 representatives from many countries will of course present their activities in the field of returning property or providing compensation for lost property
6013889 but i think the main contribution is going to be the sharing of information since its going to be an international event
6013890 there are many scholars all around the world who are digging deeply into the holocaust archives
6013891 surprisingly many of them dont have much connection to their counterparts in other countries and they do their research independently this conference will hopefully give them an opportunity to network internationally
6013892 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
6013893 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
6013894 today we are sending a locomotive for the third millennium into trial operation
6013895 in doing so we are also meeting all of the current requirements of the market and also strict new european regulations which have developed and changed very dramatically over the past few years
6013896 the czech republic currently doesnt have locomotives necessary for international connections
6013897 the average age of our locomotives is 27 years the last ones were delivered to esk dr hy in the 1990s which is why its really necessary to renew them
6013898 the new koda locomotive now ranks among the worlds safest locomotives
6013899 and koda came out as the best option for esk dr hy
6013900 koda transportation had to wait for more detailed specifications concerning future etcs implementation
6013901 we urge all the parties involved to immediately stop their military activities and to avoid any further escalation of the conflict
6013902 ah he doesnt even drive that fast anymore scoffed the head coach of canadas trampoline team
6013903 his insurance rates went up he got a lot of tickets
6013904 but its not like my 11 year old car can get much over 100

6013907 were over the moon this is awesome said ross of the second trampoline medal in two nights for his sky riders club in toronto coming on the heels of karen cockburns silver on monday in the womens event
6013908 heading into this event we figured 15 of the 15 guys could possibly make finals jason was a little lucky to make the top eight but today we decided to go big and see how it goes he went big he was great the second element in his routine was the hardest of any athlete here today
6013909 ah he doesnt even drive that fast anymore scoffed the head coach of canadas trampoline team

6013916 the results are a direct reflection of the need for more beds and community services
6013917 its got to be evident to everybody that we need more addiction and other services and smaller caseloads for mental health workers so they can provide more intensive treatment in and out of hospitals
6013918 hospitals are doing what they can but beds are at a premium and there is so much pressure to move people out
6013919 what were seeing is patients are sicker and more medically unstable but theres continuous pressure to get patients admitted treated and out
6013920 it needs to be recognized that in this report psychiatric hospitals in b c reflects the activity of only one tertiary facility riverview and this may not be the case for other provinces
6013921 with the downsizing of riverview b c has moved toward providing care for individuals with serious and persistent mental illness in smaller facilities located in communities around the province
6013922 their primary goal this summer is to continue to investigate as many colleges as they can so that as they begin school this fall they will be able to narrow their choices to five to seven schools that will be a good fit for them
6013923 and give them two to three weeks to get it prepared
6013924 theyll set up tables at lunch or well make appointments for students if they sign up
6013925 we try to take the anxiety out of the process of college
6013926 we treated injured farmers who suffered gunshot wounds but no policeman received gunshot injuries
6013927 i grew up with both my parents and with my sister and with my cousins and kelly rowland and all the girls and there was always a lot of love in my house
6013928 i guess god looks out for us and thats why we all have been able to establish the level of success that we have
6013929 the fact that the council agreed on this only means that it recommended the city assembly to approve these changes
6013930 changing the zoning plan is a long process before it can be finally approved it must be debated and discussed by all relevant state institutions in accordance with the current building law
6013931 the city assembly decided that before the new zoning plan comes into effect only changes that are important for the whole city can be assessed and debated this currently needs to happen because there is a group of proposed changes that cannot wait until the new zoning plan is approved
6013932 for now these deals are very risky because the land may or may not appreciate
6013933 a new zoning plan must involve all the representatives of our society ranging from state authorities local governments civic groups the affected land owners and individual citizens
6013934 this leads to a situation when employees who have worked for the company for a longer time end up doing the same work for less pay than new employees and having to train them to boot
6013935 you need a large brain with a lot of connectivity
6013936 if it had been a sparrow it would have been a problem
6013937 magpies are known for their ability to steal shiny objects and to hide away their loot its not too far fetched that a master thief like a magpie has that perspective taking ability
6013938 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
6013939 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
6013940 ive learned from talking about i want to win the euros and things like that
6013941 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
6013942 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
6013943 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

6013945 when it comes to manipulating music patterns rhythms or melody it just clicks for me
6013946 i ran across lots of people there like dennis chambers george duke and p funk allstars john blackwell who works with prince there were so many people around
6013947 omar hakim who has worked with miles davis and sting was friends with my father so all these people were feeding me information left and right and within a year i was getting offers including from christina aguileras music director who had seen me play live at the bitter end it was kind of mind blowing but i got a better offer from living colour as a road tech
6013948 underground basements where its just turntables mics and a load of people just rockin out
6013949 i remember talking with slovak rappers rytmus and ego from kontrafact who were releasing on sony and they had almost no distribution in the czech republic
6013950 in slovakia you can get their cd at tesco but because of the distribution networks its not available in the czech republic the same thing is with my record with witch in slovakia they were calling us and asking us to send records because they couldnt get them there
6013951 ive changed positions from just a guy who gives beats and raps to now being a studio engineer producer and songwriter
6013952 im writing for singer and actress olga lounov i recorded the california hip hop act cali agents im back working with the regime and we just added a new member c monts im working on a record right now in france with dj producer astronote set for a second quarter 2009 release and im working with a mix tape series for release in germany
6013953 honestly boss i spent all my time at the library
6013954 of course ive heard music by zelenka but ive never sung it he was a composer of very high quality so when youre doing a zelenka program you are always sure to find good music
6013955 i found the music absolutely gorgeous and the voice very strong i was really charmed by it
6013956 he switched to vocal studies when he was 18 and by 20 was singing professionally
6013957 i just finished recording vivaldis ercole sul termodonte with an italian ensemble in florence and in a couple weeks i will be singing zelenka in prague with a czech orchestra
6013958 but i like the power of imagination that i discovered in 17th century music composers like cavalli strozzi and monteverdi who is an absolutely amazing genius their style is much more free and sometimes the orchestration didnt survive so you have to build it again i like being able to interpret music that way re creating it having the freedom to add to it
6013959 the lamentations are dark and deep written in a very pure late 17th century style
6013960 then you have the other side of zelenka in sub olea much more virtuoso much more bel canto
6013961 with the tone of an angel and the virtuosity of the devil
6013962 because if im just singing like an angel i cant describe all the feelings of being human and thats not very appealing i like when people say i have a devil side because we need all these things to interpret music you cant be only angelic it would be boring
6013963 damit ist bellicon das erste deutsche unternehmen das fitness als mitarbeiter leistung bezahlt

6013966 i dont love the money raising part its finding the charities going to visit them
6013967 many conversations about cultural norms take place in front of this work
6013968 i knew it would be a wonderful experience for richard and our family i was worried about what would happen to my house plants but not the big picture
6013969 i spent the first two weeks figuring out where i was
6013970 i wasnt sure how i was going to do it but i knew i was going to continue to be the same person over here as i was in the states as much as possible
6013971 theres a lot of physical therapy for walking sitting balance and coordination but theres also working on the ability to think and behave in a setting like eating dinner and what utensils to use and how to think it through
6013972 all the doctors wanted to give him an artificial arm but it was the last thing the patient wanted with his head injury hed never learn to manipulate it and the family saw it as a cost for something so high tech they never thought hed use it
6013973 i consulted alexandra many times and valued her experience and opinion about where we were going to distribute charity funds
6013974 its finding the charities going to visit them that has been really important to me
6013975 they are the only troupe within the realm of new circus that performs completely in the air jumping flying never touching the ground
6013976 but some of the wires are very low with one only a half meter above the ground so its not for the feeling of danger you get the aesthetic the emotion not fear for the performers
6013977 alma and amanda is a powerful dialogue between two sisters
6013978 one is out of the home and one continues to stay there it is about the point when the two sisters are in totally different positions in their lives
6013979 in what way are we to capture such small objects all those byproducts of nature and of civilization they are too small too everyday and even too ugly and they do not seem to suit our brilliant photography of today achieved with the help of perfect machines
6013980 por volta das 18h come a o barulho que incomoda demais sempre tardinha quando eles come am a procurar abrigo

6013982 the hoax is a dishonourable mischievous product of desperate elements wishing to stir unnecessary anxiety discontent and tension within the targeted communities
6013983 the hoax is a disingenuous farce that undermines our constitutional democracy
6013984 were doing this so that we can start sending the people out to come out and start fishing in our homeland because its been taken away since 1997 since the law was amended back in 1997 when they started doing the preserve areas and then in 2001 that the time they started doing the law
6013985 although in this picture i look more like buddy holly
6013986 come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while
6013987 this is a desolate place and the hour is now late 36 send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat
6013988 shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat
6013989 my sisters story is one of many thousands in eritrea
6013990 the regime is extremely hostile to any democratic notion or rule of law

6014004 while a qualified personal injury attorney cant guarantee the outcome of your case they can guarantee that no stone is left unturned in working to provide you with the compensation you deserve

6014163 ive no comment to make on speculation if we sign any decent players well release a statement but theres no point me talking about players who might or might not be coming to the football club
6014164 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6014165 its out of my hands weve made some great offers for players and good deals with clubs im quite relaxed about it
6014166 if players want to come and we can take them to another level fantastic but if they want to stay at the clubs theyre at good luck to them its not a major problem
6014167 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6014168 ive brought lots of players in and if i feel theres an offer that we think is a good offer obviously id consider it
6014169 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6014170 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6014171 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6014172 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6014173 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6014174 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6014175 since the cold war ended the united states has been pushing the buttons of russian frustration and paranoia by moving ever further into moscows former sphere of influence and we have rarely stopped to consider whether we were overreaching even as evidence mounted that the patience of a wealthier and more assertive russia was wearing very thin
6014176 georgia another breadbasket and location of a critical pipeline is the birthplace of stalin whos enjoying a new revisionist popularity in russia putin warned repeatedly that he would never permit nato in the caucasus but we kept shrugging this off as more bluff and bluster once youve driven a bear into a cave it may be wise to stop poking him with a stick we seemed to delight in it
6014177 the bush administration has only stepped up this policy it is one of the few areas where there has been real continuity between clinton and bush with its unwavering effort to set up missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic
6014178 they may be talking of georgian atrocities but we in the west have not heard them nor will we given the bias of our media which is in thrall to the georgia lobby and its u
6014179 i believe i can fight a more effective more thoughtful more strategic more proactive more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side
6014180 vielen deutschen mathematikern gerade auch den j ngeren gaben sie so das gef hl da sie trotz des unheils das deutschland ber die welt gebracht hatte nicht aus der internationalen gemeinschaft der mathematiker ausgeschlossen waren
6014181 gesprochen habe ich sie wohl zum erstenmal als ich 1951 52 als junger assistent von erlangen aus nach oberwolfach kam ich geh re zu den vielen mathematikern in deutschland denen sie nach dem kriege mut und kraft geschenkt haben
6014182 i most strongly condemn this bomb attack in algeria which claimed the lives of more than 40 people and left many more injured some seriously
6014183 the spate of terrorist attacks of the past months which have primarily targeted the algerian security forces represent a horrific and cowardly attempt to damage peace and reconciliation in algeria these show that terrorism is still a threat and underscore the necessity of cooperating to counter it
6014184 hello e mailer thanks for your email i am currently out of the office until thursday this email will be deleted thanks
6014185 above all unity in the face of continuing russian refusal
6014186 i have an order to stop them here to not let anyone go past
6014187 they just call these foreign journalists move the column in front of them and then when they are gone they put them back
6014188 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing
6014189 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6014190 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
6014191 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6014192 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
6014193 were going to achieve energy independence and were going to do it by using every resource at our disposal to get the job done including new offshore drilling
6014194 we just dont have enough oil underground to drill our way out of this problem
6014195 use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
6014196 i will let no one question my love of this country
6014197 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6014198 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
6014199 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job
6014200 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience vs barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
6014201 the best that can be said about these ideas is that theyre pandering
6014202 far worse theyre distractions from the deadly serious business of creating a new national energy policy
6014203 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6014204 thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6014205 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
6014206 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
6014207 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
6014208 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
6014209 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
6014210 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
6014211 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular
6014212 to carry pennsylvania barack obama is going to need a huge margin out of philadelphia
6014213 he said you know im agnostic on the science and im agnostic on the politics
6014214 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
6014215 georgia is not a member of nato what can nato do
6014216 i think we have in place what we should have
6014217 isolation has been tried in the past and didnt work i favor hard headed engagement
6014218 human suffering agitates all no matter which religion ethnicity or language those who suffer belong to
6014219 rusia no apoyar el proyecto de resoluci n sometido por francia hoy martes
6014220 la retirada de tropas rusas concluir entre el 21 y el 22 de agosto a excepci n de un grupo de 500 personas responsables de la aplicaci n de las medidas adicionales de seguridad previstas en el quinto punto del acuerdo
6014221 we waited three and a half years for this moment and you know it can be taken away from you at any time
6014222 thats why this feels so great to beat a great team and a great pitcher
6014223 if michael phelps can win eight gold medals then why cant usa win softball
6014224 this is what the olympics is about having extraordinary performances and making the viewers on tv watching us get chills if we can do that every game then thats success for softball
6014225 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the pool and our womens basketball team dominating and thats what the olympics is about going your absolute all for your sport
6014226 im trying not to think about the possible demise of olympic softball but away from the field its in our minds and in our hearts a game like today shows the beauty of our sport and what its all about
6014227 the games are getting closer and closer and by no means are we absolutely running over everybody
6014228 if that is the reason who wants to play in a sport where winning is bad
6014229 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the swimming pool you watch our mens basketball team dominate i would hope the ioc wants the olympics to be about giving everything that you possibly have and if you happen to win by a lot thats what makes the game so beautiful
6014230 i had so much emotion so much want to go out on top
6014231 i got a massage 1 8after the race3 8 and my masseur thought it felt great
6014232 i dont think it was an injury of any sort i think it was just terrible timing and really unfortunate i definitely will be ready for the 4x400 1 8relay3 8 whatever i need to do it this is it this is the olympics this is what ive been dreaming about all my life and leaving here with two medals will be much sweeter than leaving with one
6014233 when i look at the grand scheme of things i average 49
6014234 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
6014235 we were stopped by a mob near kathua and some one from the mob hurled a petrol bomb inside my vehicle and i immediately stopped the vehicle on roadside
6014236 they also looted my belongings and also snatched rs 6 000 from my pocket
6014237 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6014238 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6014239 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6014240 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned russian president dmitry medvedev said last month as the missile talks moved to a close
6014241 we vacate this rule because it is contrary to the statutory directive
6014242 this is a huge victory against one of the most egregious rollbacks of environmental protections in our nations history
6014243 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
6014244 the consequences of this conclusion are that the etheridge shire council is not an employer under the provisions of the workplace relations act
6014245 in respect of a local government which is a body politic of a state government
6014246 our union always thought the idea that local councils could be defined as corporations and so rope in all local government workers under the yoke of the hated work choices laws was questionable
6014247 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
6014248 im so excited its my dream age i dont know why but literally since my 12th birthday ive wanted to turn 30
6014249 i had some fun with ur so gay its also about guys with guy liner that use flat irons its just a saying its like calling someone a b h youre like hey b h it just felt appropriate
6014250 i think gay people have a wonderful sense of humor i think theyll get it and embrace it
6014251 its an anthem for power of the people for females gays exes anybody whos been broken up with that wants to get over a guy
6014252 im sure they opt out of singing i kissed a girl or ur so gay but theyre singing along to every other song on the record theyre just glad im not strung out doing centerfolds and s t like that
6014253 i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock it promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6014254 she is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are
6014255 after looking at all the treatment plans available to me i had a prophylactic double mastectomy i just wanted to be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6014256 im going to have cute boobs until im 90 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
6014257 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes its all part of healing its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6014258 the zip of her dress wasnt done up properly and her jacket was tucked into the back of it she was in a real state
6014259 oddly she left clutching a box full of junk which had make up skin care bits written on the top
6014260 when they came to leave they couldnt open the front door
6014261 amy said she had lost the key after locking it so there was a bit of a panic as they tried to work out how they were going to get out
6014262 sources have revealed exclusively to me that ryan and rachel are definitely together again they are on holiday in toronto and are both very happy
6014263 rachel and ryan talked when he was away from the deejay stand they really looked like good pals he seemed happy to see her
6014264 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good

6014270 theres always a risk if you allow children to play in streams
6014271 my advice is always to regard streams across beaches with caution there is an enhanced risk of bugs in the water when theres heavy rain

6014276 this is an exciting year for broadcasting in china as local audience interest in the olympic games is at an unprecedented level

6014278 i dont know what you people want to hear from me
6014279 he came here thinking he was going to win a gold medal
6014280 the reality of it is the cuban is a tough wrestler ben is young not to make any excuses but its the first time hes made an olympic team we have to get better
6014281 ben wrestled a good match but the only thing we can say now is in another four years hopefully well get the chance to come back and try again and hopefully make some world teams in the meantime
6014282 in college he got away with allowing people to get to his legs
6014283 weve really trained and hes made some great advances as far as defending his legs but the cuban is good one of the best leg attackers in the world
6014284 thats why he advanced as far as bens defense its only going to get better the kids a winner hes a hard worker
6014285 he is in the process of seeking asylum in britain
6014286 eleven years after labour came to power almost two million children have left school without any good gcse passes
6014287 the government has let down an entire generation of pupils who are not getting anything like the basic set of qualifications they need to continue studying or get the job they want
6014288 the problems with educational underachievement are concentrated in the poorest areas of the country it is in those areas that our policies for a swedish model of school reform to create thousands more good new school places can make the most difference
6014289 only then will children from disadvantaged families start to get the same kind of opportunity as others
6014290 the essence of our operation for the 2008 olympics is to provide the most detailed and powerful search capacity to our production teams together with instantaneous access to the library of logged material
6014291 the olympics are a competitive event for broadcasters as well as athletes and we wanted to push our coverage up to a new level of performance the volume of material we are handling from the games and the very detailed data we are adding to it required a carefully thought out approach so that we could ensure the most efficient access with the layered and flexible metadata scheme we have devised with omnibus we have built a tool our producers are using to create coverage of unprecedented quality
6014292 for the team involved in the design and delivery of this complex opus project it is tremendously rewarding to see the system being used for such a prestigious global event as the olympics
6014293 this is the culmination of many months of hard work by the nrk and omnibus design teams

6014298 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london
6014299 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality
6014300 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
6014301 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6014302 its almost like i dont know i dont want to say its just really hard
6014303 at the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed me and i just couldnt move it anymore
6014304 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home

6014315 while the creditworthiness of borrowers has always been of paramount concern to creditors recent developments in the debt markets including the deteriorating credit of some major corporate borrowers the recent credit crunch and the implementation of basel ii guidelines have put a spotlight on creditors prospects for recovery of principal and interest after a borrower default
6014316 from the creditors perspective it is no longer only a question of whether a particular borrower will default but also whether and to what extent they will be repaid principal and interest after a default and how long it will take
6014317 while it would be an overstatement to claim that the uae is an unfriendly jurisdiction for secured creditors the laws and regulations addressing creditors rights and the effect of a debtors insolvency on those rights are not as evolved as those in many more developed jurisdictions
6014318 in addition as of the time of writing there has never been a major corporate insolvency in the uae the local laws and regulations relating to creditors rights in the event of a debtor insolvency remain substantially untested
6014319 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit

6014324 ncbs sponsorship of al qaeda flowed largely although not exclusively through muwafaq foundation
6014325 plaintiffs offer only speculation and hearsay in their effort to link ncb to al qaeda terrorists who committed the sept 11 attacks
6014326 mr kadis actions and those of his muwafaq foundation and businesses give rise to a reasonable basis to believe that they have facilitated terrorist activities
6014327 there is little doubt that a financial conduit to bin laden was handled through the national commercial bank

6014333 this was a great conference the topics covered were timely and dealt in depth with the pending changes to hd radio
6014334 few successful media businesses can operate profitably in a single country so expansion into multiple territories is now often key to long term business success
6014335 this is a challenge in all areas of broadcast operations as international staff increasingly need to collaborate as a unified team they need to work together to produce content and promote channels for multiple territories adding multi language capability means that staff throughout the business can use mediator to share the same content workflow and infrastructure more effectively than ever before mediators new multi language capabilities also enhance pharos support services staff at the pharos uk support centre can securely access customers systems remotely and work in english whilst the customers technical and operational staff can view content metadata and processes in their local language this can help to resolve support issues in daily operations quickly and decisively

6014340 we lost three guys in iraq with big connections to rugby and their families turned round and said is there anything we could do
6014341 we also won the army cup in rugby last year and its an opportunity for us to get out raise awareness and raise money for our three charities the army benevolent fund the welsh charitable trust and help for heroes
6014342 we then hope to finish the challenge by scoring a converted try before the wales v south africa game at the millennium stadium in cardiff in november and then lay a wreath in honour of sir tasker watkins who had been a member of the welch regiment
6014343 he was a lovely man and it would be nice to do it we will have honoured all the soldiers from the regiment across wales and then we could honour arguably the most famous one sir tasker and pay tribute to him on the hallowed turf
6014344 then we drove to every rugby club but i felt a bit lazy doing that so we thought why not cycle

6014351 as a committee chairman in the state senate in 2003 obama supported gop efforts to add language to the act copied from federal legislation clarifying that it would have no legal impact on the availability of abortions obama then opposed the bills final passage since then he has said he would have backed the bill as it was written and approved almost unanimously the year before
6014352 obama aides acknowledged yesterday that the wording of the state and federal bills was virtually identical but they added the impact of a state law is different because detailed abortion procedures and regulations are governed by states
6014353 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
6014354 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6014355 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
6014356 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
6014357 when you have copyright infringement there are some damages you never recover
6014358 it is by sheer luck no one has been injured although part of the site has suffered damage as a result of one of the fires
6014359 we are treating this as arson with intent to endanger life a very serious offence which carries a lengthy prison sentence

6014367 in big seizures theres a very strong tendency to ship ivory out of a different country than where its poached its a bit of a red herring
6014368 the methods we developed are very important in that regard because it focuses where the poaching is ongoing
6014369 crime syndicates were targeting specific populations for intense exploitation hitting them hard and fast to satisfy the demands of a particular consignment
6014370 at the time of the analyses authorities thought the ivory came from tanzania and or the democratic republic of the congo our analyses refocused the investigation allowed authorities to point the finger at zambia and get them to do something

6014496 any little snag we saw this morning at all was a student trying to turn left
6014497 i think its good for us to be back in school focusing on kids because thats what this is all about and even though its difficult that weve lost bussing service for students we have a great staff working to do everything they can to make sure kids get a good education
6014498 it was a very very smooth operation only a few didnt have their schedules but we got them all off to their home zones

6014510 now i can call corporate and let them know i checked
6014511 hypothetically we have no problem with the changes as long as they are done uniformly and fairly to all businesses
6014512 the fall starts our busy season and weve had cars backed up to goodwill before
6014513 as far as the drive thru these changes could double your time in the drive thru line and clog the stoplight at maple and brookover

6014530 die eignung oder nichteignung von sch lern auf einzelne schularten zu erfassen
6014531 weil viele eltern die bertrittsentscheidung als existentiell f r die lebensperspektive ihrer kinder

6014533 das interesse der eltern wie aller staatsb rger an einer fortschrittlichen und zeitgem en erziehung und bildung
6014534 dass ihre fachlichen f higkeiten und ihr engagement nicht wirklich erw nscht sind
6014535 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
6014536 making a sequel to a game is always tougher especially given the arms race were seeing in videogames development
6014537 games do not compete in fun experiences they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
6014538 this is a significant milestone in the continued growth of the company
6014539 it gives us the opportunity to further expand our product catalogue and take lighthouse interactive to the next level we look forward to working with nintendo
6014540 il legislatore e stato scavalcato dalla confraternita dei fratelli musulmani che controlla il sindacato dei medici e che ha imposto una norma fortemente discriminatoria violando i diritti umani e la costituzione e minando lunita nazionale
6014541 perche la tutela delle persone indipendentemente dalla loro fede nei confronti del fenomeno del traffico dorgani impedisce che si creino tensioni ulteriori tra le due comunita

6014543 both banks described it as a non event to the associates and customers

6014547 die zukunftsorientierte weiterentwicklung eines modernen bildungswesens ist eine daueraufgabe der sich bayern seit langem erfolgreich stellt unser ziel ist es unseren kindern bestm gliche und begabungsgerechte bildungschancen zu er ffnen und die unterrichtsversorgung weiter zu verbessern und die klassenst rken zu reduzieren bereits heute liegt die durchschnittliche klassenst rke bei den grundschulen bei unter 23 sch lern bei hauptschulen bei 21 sch lern bei realschulen und gymnasien bei 28 sch lern auch in der n chsten legislaturperiode wird das thema bildung vorfahrt haben wir werden hier eindeutig einen haushaltspolitischen schwerpunkt setzen
6014548 vom nationalen bildungsgipfel erwarte ich mir dass damit das thema bildung so wie in bayern bei den priorit tenlisten ganz nach vorne rutscht ich erwarte mir im herbst dass der bund wo er nach der f deralismuskommission kompetenzen hat diese auch intensiv ausf llt das bedeutet ein substanzielles insbesondere finanzielles engagement des bundes in den bereichen sprachf rderung f r migranten bernahme der kosten der mittagsverpflegung an den schulen f r bed rftige ma nahmen zur besseren verzahnung von schule und beruf weiterbildung und bei den forschungsausgaben
6014549 bayern legt mit seinen entscheidungen zur bildungspolitik die messlatte f r den nationalen bildungsgipfel bewusst hoch wir brauchen berall in deutschland h chstes niveau bei der bildung
6014550 die bildungspolitik von der kinderkrippe ber das schulwesen bis zum hochschulwesen steht im zentrum der regierungspolitik der staatsregierung
6014551 ich konnte bei den hauptschulen alle antr ge auf ganztagsklassen genehmigen ebenso die auf ausbau offener ganztagsangebote
6014552 so k nnen alle kinder in der grundschule mit einer vergleichbaren sprachlichen basis starten und haben damit einen h heren lernerfolg
6014553 wir d rfen nicht auf systeme schauen in denen kinder und jugendliche schlechter ausgebildet werden
6014554 wir m ssen die s ulen haupt und realschule sowie gymnasium st rken
6014555 nicht nur wissen und k nnen zu vermitteln sondern auch herz und charakter zu bilden

6014561 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6014562 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
6014563 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me
6014564 and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6014565 i dont drink at all and that day i went into the red rum pub and started drinking fosters
6014566 i was taking to a fella who said i should try a double whisky
6014567 by the time the first race came around i had drank seven pints of fosters and six double shots of whisky
6014568 after the first race i went in for another pint and i think it was spiked
6014569 i didnt know where i was and my legs went
6014570 i thought i need to get home i was feeling really bad really ill
6014571 i have written to the race course apologising for my actions
6014572 i was right out of order i really am sorry
6014573 during the time we have spent in the make up chair we talked about everything but the photo shoot global issues babies human rights
6014574 paul starr has this uncanny ability to look at a face and see what it needs hes done my face a thousand times and never repeated a look

6014580 we dont have parking permits and the parking here is horrendous already with the school and the hotel
6014581 there are a lot of student homes so about five cars to one house its not just the customers where are the staff going to park
6014582 it is wrong there is a lot of traffic pollution already and theyll put the local shops out of business and that will change the infrastructure
6014583 i also feel for the people whose gardens are going to be overlooked
6014584 it would be better to move the planned new surgery onto that site instead of losing a green field that children can play on
6014585 no more than 10 to 12 vehicles would be using the car park at any one time
6014586 it is not anticipated that the car borne traffic that it will generate will be as significant as some residents perceive
6014587 everybody heres against it not sainsburys just the location stanwix isnt a village anymore its turning into just like anywhere else there are enough shops in this area weve got morrisons aldi and spar yet theyre desperate for it in the morton area
6014588 it isnt sainsburys that will finish us it is the shoppers themselves who choose where to go we have a very loyal clientele and will fight for as long as we can one man businesses are a rare commodity these days
6014589 the principle of the retail and residential aspect of the proposed development is acceptable

6014592 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6014593 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6014594 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6014595 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6014596 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

6014599 any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad

6014666 i thought it would be nice to get together again if you wanted to
6014667 yeah our training here is over now weve apparently done all the damage we can do and theyre breaking up the band sending me to florida sending all the guys to different places some of them are going home getting discharged
6014668 thats not so fa um so you called to see if
6014669 id like to see you again before i leave and i thought id call and see if you wanted to get together tonight
6014670 great i can get one of the guys to drop me at that same barbecue restaurant cecils about eight that all right
6014671 well maybe i shouldnt have but its good to see you
6014672 you said youre leaving for florida tomorrow what will you be doing there
6014673 theyre not sending you out on a carrier again are they
6014674 maybe youve heard of the navys demonstration team they fly the new jets around to air shows
6014675 yeah but we have to go back to your place for me to do that
6014676 i want to suck you let me suck you daniel i want to so bad
6014677 it makes sense why they call that sixty nine when you think about it its the shape of the numbers if you put them together one over the other
6014678 i know this started as just a pick up you know back on beale street
6014679 come in come in its good to see you my god this is a surprise
6014680 i hope this is okay just showing up like this
6014681 or shall we just go back to bed right now
6014682 baby dont do that too long or ill come before we get to fuck
6014683 this should be better than vaseline wont stain quite as much its water based
6014684 well a couple of days i guess if you want
6014685 do you want to talk some more or is it time to go back to bed
6014686 a guy got killed in training friday put his jet right into the swamp
6014687 no sorry what a shitty thing to say youre not kidding youre entirely serious im so sorry jack did you see it were you there
6014688 yeah i was on his wing just behind him we mostly practice over the everglades i think i told you that
6014689 his engine started to smoke he talked himself through the checklist we all kind of hung back eased out of the formation and then he couldnt hold a bank he couldnt control the plane he was just gone i dont know why he couldnt bail out i guess he ran out of time
6014690 well friend i dont know but yeah i knew him
6014691 good to see you so glad you could make it
6014692 its good to be here thanks for the heads up
6014693 hiett this is daniel jackson another real memphis jazz fan
6014694 yes she was she wanted me to make sure you knew she was off work tonight
6014695 ill keep that in mind she knows we wont be able to get away until late
6014696 well no not exactly but i was in memphis almost all spring this year doing some training you meet people
6014697 i mean i knew what you did in a way theoretically but that
6014698 you dont have to talk about it i mean im not looking for a review
6014699 spread your wings and take to the sky right that was the line
6014700 the rooms kind of hot i could open the windows but
6014701 i think we can just make do with the ceiling fan dont you
6014702 you know until today i didnt realize your real name was jonathan im surprised you never told me that i would have thought i would have needed the whole name for the ipo
6014703 that i didnt even know your rank until you sent me that first postcard
6014704 no i suppose it wasnt you look really hot in those summer whites you know
6014705 yes and i have the sweat stains to prove it
6014706 why doctor jackson do you kiss your sister with that mouth
6014707 well then just lay your head back and relax i want to make this really good for you
6014708 as much as you always love it i have no doubt of that that it can be good
6014709 oh jack i could talk about it id love to talk about it but just now id rather do this
6014710 you know this but its tightest right at first right behind the opening
6014711 it helps a lot if you push like youre squeezing something out and give me the weight of your leg relax as much as you can its gonna hurt a little but it helps if you can just let yourself feel it feel where the muscles are so you can relax
6014712 push for me jack breathe for me and push bear down
6014713 i see why you wanted that i get it now
6014714 you know something the first time i did you that first time we went to bed you broke me in for that too
6014715 youre going to find this hilarious then id never done it before either
6014716 i hate to do this this time but ive got to go tonight we have to fly back to the base in florida first thing tomorrow ive got to ask you to drive me back to the hotel
6014717 have i told you lately that im really glad youre on board for the kissing thing
6014718 i dont know that youd need this because i cant imagine that id be gone but i want you to know whenever you want to come whenever you get time please youre youre welcome i want you to
6014719 they the government actually needs me to work first thing in the morning
6014720 well my main areas of expertise are linguistics and archaeology as you know
6014721 but sometimes the government needs me for cryptology codebreaking or code writing
6014722 its not really a lot of fun but hey patriotic duty world safe for democracy you know the drill
6014723 that i do so what language russian chinese hungarian turkish
6014724 this is the part where i say i wish i could tell you and you nod understandingly
6014725 we do have a little more time before first thing in the morning though dont we
6014726 you finally get some real leave you even got christmas off finally you got to go home and then you chose to spend part of your time off with me which is so just so
6014727 you have a whole week this time to spend here and now i have to go its just too ironic i dont know whether to laugh or cry
6014728 i guess youre right and wed better take advantage of what night weve got left because i can sleep on the plane you can sleep in after i go if you want
6014729 you can lock the place up for me when you leave
6014730 youre kidding youre kidding me well yes but didnt you say the director wanted i know but that wait a minute wait i might be able to can i call you back in sixty seconds give me the number again i dont have my book here got it call you right back
6014731 the pilot from millington they were trying to get to take me has peritonitis they cant seem to come up with someone else on such short notice but they dont want me to wait for a commercial flight either
6014732 sure i could do it okay im officially on leave until saturday but
6014733 i thought of that why are you here why do i know you all that
6014734 theyd have to call pensacola clear it with my oic
6014735 look we dont talk about this much but i know you have more to lose here than i do its true that i could get fired from memphis state but hey ive been fired before ive lived abroad ive lived in new york i can always find some work to do somewhere and i have no family to embarrass and i have my own place here its mine free and clear so theres not a lot that could really be taken away from me you on the other hand if someone in the navy or the government were to find out about us
6014736 i kinda miss those beechcrafts thats a solid old bird there good one to have under you reliable fast too
6014737 there is nothing wrong with me being back in town for the charlie parker festival there is nothing wrong with us being buddies there is nothing wrong with us having met on beale street last spring were both jazz fans right
6014738 who are you talking to there can you tell me that
6014739 major davis paul davis hes air force and hes the liaison with the nsa ive known him since korea
6014740 theyll put me in a hotel somewhere eventually but i may end up working into the night i dont
6014741 this major simmons is the pilot who was kind enough to give doctor jackson a lift in from memphis this morning on very short notice
6014742 he has a weakness for straights with face cards and he rarely draws to club flushes
6014743 clearly youve learned everything important about me that there is to know
6014744 daniel has been assigned a hotel and it looks as if theyre going to wrap up their work before midnight after all so he asked me to come and either see about your travel arrangements or inquire whether you intended to stay in washington tonight
6014745 and if you have no objection id like to get a bite to eat here kind of a late dinner
6014746 i was on leave you know from my assignment in florida
6014747 i was happy to help out daniel didnt say much of course but it sounded like this assignment was pretty important
6014748 im assuming youre coming downtown with me to the hotel
6014749 thats very kind of you to come out late at night all this way to be my chauffeur
6014750 really thanks again for coming all the way out here
6014751 no thank you for being willing to bring daniel to us on such short notice it was a lucky break for us
6014752 yeah kind of puzzled but okay he said as long as you didnt do anything stupid he was fine with you doing a favor for another branch
6014753 weve got you through the week then if we need you
6014754 youll probably be flying daniel home again in a couple of days
6014755 i would kill for a turn in that hot water
6014756 they brought in something some sandwiches god that feels good
6014757 thanks for staying i thought you mightve hitched something back to florida or back to your car
6014758 this is much better than what i was doing two hours ago
6014759 yeah it was just about that futile for a while but i made a lot of progress much more than they expected actually
6014760 well this is you were talking about isnt it you on the job is a guarantee of success
6014761 we made so much progress actually that they are going to take what i did and send it off and wait for an answer
6014762 in fact ive been told to get some sleep and some breakfast and stand by here they might need me tomorrow and they might not
6014763 sleep in oh doctor jackson youll be so bored stuck here in this old hotel with nothing on tv and no books to read
6014764 you know its awfully late why dont we just go to sleep we dont have to do anything tonight dear
6014765 will you lie down for me i want that tonight if you do to be on top
6014766 did i see some hand lotion on the sink in there
6014767 could i get a pitcher of coffee to take upstairs
6014768 i hope the weather in the capitals agreeing with you
6014769 i guess its a little early for a poker game but hey
6014770 if its poker were playing this morning lieutenant the stakes are already way past your limit youre bluffing and i have an ace in the hole
6014771 i dont see any cards sir do you so if its a joke youre making youre losing me
6014772 coffee with room service you really are his lap dog how considerate of you and how very inappropriate
6014773 you really should have thought about your career in such a high profile position with your nations government before you decided to roll over and put your legs in the air for him but i guess for your kind logical forethought is just not an option
6014774 doctor jackson should be a little more careful in his pet selection next time
6014775 a major simmons air force uniform was in the restaurant downstairs when i went to have breakfast he gave me a ration of crap he thinks he knows about us
6014776 nothing substantial saw that i was taking coffee upstairs knew that you were registered here called me your lap dog
6014777 i was so wrong to pull you into this i should have known i should never have asked you to fly me here i just
6014778 you needed a pilot i was available and i did kind of have to talk you into it
6014779 but it is i knew better than to let you come with me i was being selfish when i first asked i knew immediately that it was a bad idea that it was much too exposed for you too risky i knew better than to be with you in public here like this washington is a fishbowl and i should never have pulled you into the
6014780 i cant the project is you know cant tell you
6014781 and were into something just as outside the rules as anything the government has me doing here
6014782 i know you cant tell me about the project youre working on im not worried about that
6014783 i think i dont know but i think that for some reason hes running an anti communist crusade that must include trying to gather information against homosexuals i thought it was just you know root out the reds but after this after what he said to you
6014784 he must have some kind of mandate some reason to look at the military and maybe all the branches not just the air force
6014785 i know i just i cant say much about this okay but he tried to get a friend of mine in trouble back in korea but in wartime a lot of stuff gets overlooked and anyway i thought it was just about me at first and then i thought it was just about communism but if he said that
6014786 theres more when davis came to get me last night simmons was there hanging out at the officers club at bolling thats when he met me for the first time wed all been playing poker just killing time but when davis came i guess simmons put it together that id been your ride here
6014787 thats the first time he called me your lap dog
6014788 im so so sorry this is so bad for you i do feel responsible i should have known
6014789 hey like i said before people get to have friends yes friends who go to jazz concerts with them and visit them on leave and even fly them to washington if theres an emergency
6014790 you dont understand theres nothing simmons cant twist nothing he wont
6014791 he was stupid daniel showing me his hand like that now we know we know what hes up to we know what he wants he wont get it
6014792 he may be sneaky and underhanded but were more sneaky and more underhanded
6014793 we sit tight we see what happens and we can make sure he gets no ammunition whatsoever whatever kind of witch hunt hes on
6014794 hunger and worry are for once winning over your considerable charms
6014795 lets get you some breakfast youve been thinking about all this crap on two cups of coffee not good
6014796 i dont mean to be the one to unilaterally define
6014797 jack has but i havent but thats not important yes i understand well be there
6014798 he wants us to meet him at the side entrance in half an hour
6014799 okaaay so much for a day off to eat bonbons and watch lucy
6014800 its no trouble truly you havent inconvenienced me at all i got to sleep in after all the excitement last night and i even got a shower
6014801 and give you indigestion on top of it im afraid
6014802 well it seems theres a continuation of last nights excitement after all this briefing will be a little strange im afraid because lieutenant oneill isnt cleared for everything youre cleared for but ive been informed were going to have to work around that because hes been tapped to be your pilot again
6014803 it seems major simmons has learned of your background flying tracers he thought that was a very convenient coincidence
6014804 thats exactly what i mean and yes both of you
6014805 freezing my ass off same as you arent you gonna offer an old friend a smoke
6014806 sure i am if i knew the old friends name
6014807 is there a branch of the government thats not involved in this operation
6014808 id have to say no everyone wants a piece of this and therere just so damn many pieces
6014809 well you know me harry just a humble pilot my piece is to fly the brass in and fly them out then game over
6014810 last i knew youd taken your discharge and gone to work for the civilians
6014811 and thats why im here to represent the fbi any time you have this kind of high level contact with the agents of a foreign government theres a chance of contamination this time we made sure to have our own people involved
6014812 high level right you flatter me harry like i told you im just the chauffeur this trip
6014813 you can cut the ingenue act for me tommy boy surely doctor jackson told you more than that
6014814 doctor jackson has told me exactly nothing as is totally appropriate for his work whatever it is
6014815 you dont know whats going on why were all here
6014816 like i said doctor jackson takes his classified things very seriously
6014817 ill cut to the chase for you captain im here to be the bureaus eyes and ears for the big meeting with these russian technocrats that your friend the good doctor is going to translate for
6014818 but out of the goodness of my heart i waltzed out here into the freezing fucking mist to give you a heads up about simmons if the hair on the back of your neck wasnt already standing up yeah you know what i mean good thing youre not playing dumb about everything about this operation though the dumb act always was one of your best things
6014819 youre on his list my friend jackson is too and has been for years maybe he didnt tell you that but simmons hasnt been able to pardon the pun nail the good doctor for anything yet apparently hes too valuable or too careful or both but god help me im feeling compelled to warn you for auld lang syne that simmons thinks youre his newest and best piece of leverage against jackson so watch your ass not just your boyfriends savvy
6014820 im serious as a heart attack captain ignore me if you want but if you do youll aw fuck it dont know why i even bother
6014821 im trying to tell you youve got to do something jack youve got to strike first if youve got any strings to pull at all pull them hard fast soon cause this wont be just barracks gossip believe me simmons is trouble he has friends in high places
6014822 im sure baby come on i want it like this this time
6014823 well have to go out and get some food in a while and youre probably about out of cigarettes
6014824 im not supposed to tell you everything about what went on out there and i wont but i am going to tell you that those were soviet scientists from their military satellite program yorktown and some other navy vessels had marked the location of what probably is wreckage from the rocket that launched sputnik and we managed to convince them to send some of their people out there to rendezvous with us and to see if we could bring it up
6014825 theres a lot more going on in regard to that trip we made that i am not allowed to talk about but at least thats some of it
6014826 can we go out on the porch i gotta tell you the latest about simmons and for that i definitely need a smoke
6014827 i know you shocked yourself saying that but i wanted to hear it ive been wanting to hear it and wanting to say it for a while now but you know
6014828 i want to do this i dont know what is what to call it but i know for certain that i love you and i want to do this
6014829 soon as you finish here go see morris youve got some news
6014830 oh yes oneill separated from your heavenly flock i believe
6014831 the team went on to san diego this week sir while i was overseas
6014832 hello wow i guess you got back okay this must be costing you a mint how are you
6014833 i ah i got sent away off the blue angels
6014834 i got theyre sending me offshore im in norfolk right now i leave port tomorrow on the forrestal
6014835 it was good to hear daniels outrage it made up for all the blank stares all the furtive whispers back in florida
6014836 godammit jack that fucking asshole is behind this hes got to be weve got to
6014837 yes yes it looks like ill still get to fly
6014838 i gotta go daniel i wanted i wanted to call though
6014839 theres no one around so is there something i can do for you
6014840 one more stunt like that and i turn you in understand
6014841 for being a fag like you we all know why you got busted back here
6014842 im not the one making the propositions here cupcake you heard what i said leave me the fuck alone or youll wish youd never been born
6014843 i was just going to say you must be lieutenant oneill
6014844 i would have known you anywhere the way doctor jackson described you but why are you here
6014845 you dont know nobody told you mr oneill youd best get up to the hospital right away
6014846 doctor jackson got himself beaten up real bad it was last weekend because of the rally for reverend king
6014847 i havent been over there myself you understand doctor jordan called me not his own doctor you know the ancient egypt doctor from memphis state now you dont need to be standing here theyve got him over at baptist right downtown get on with you get
6014848 daniel what happened to you your cleaning lady said you were beaten up at a rally
6014849 martin luther king was speaking ten days ago i dont know exactly what day is it the rally was on the seventh and the crowd was quite large and the police decided it was too large too uppity and they broke it up i was far from the only one who was hurt
6014850 they said i have a concussion and some cracked ribs
6014851 i dont know now that you mention it i might have lost them i havent been able to read much the concussion gives you a splendid headache better than any hangover
6014852 i dont give a fuck that you were trying to read read if you can whatever i hate this this is wrong
6014853 im pretty sure i was a a target beyond the police breaking up a civil rights rally trying to discourage the voter registration i mean that was going on all around me people getting beaten getting hoses turned on them that had that was going on all around the perimeter of the crowd but i think
6014854 this is a friend of mine from the jazz club jack oneill
6014855 well soon i think but you know ive been reluctant to let you go home knowing that you live alone we discussed this earlier
6014856 id really like to go home doctor jack can look after me and i promise to follow your instructions
6014857 does it ever now come over here and help me lie the fuck down again i hate this
6014858 but could you just stay here for a little while
6014859 i know thats fine just not right now all right
6014860 it was longer than it seemed longer than i thought it would be it seemed like forever between your postcards i would get two or three at once and then nothing for weeks
6014861 what i wrote to you didnt you get my letters
6014862 we should talk about this later after you get some rest but i think this is all part of the same thing i didnt get any mail at all the whole time i was out not from you or from mom or from gayle
6014863 its like i was in a fog just drifting the whole time i was in the hospital now that youre here i can think again
6014864 mrs keller was the one who told me you were in the hospital
6014865 you know i never until this minute thought to wonder about that how you found out
6014866 mondays her regular day every other monday do you mind going down and checking in with her or you can send her up here
6014867 daniel i never had a cleaning lady in my life neither did my mom trim carpenters wives from chicago do not have cleaning ladies you tell me what you want me to tell her
6014868 okay look this isnt her day to come shes clearly checking up on me and running the vacuum is her way of announcing shes here you see so just ask her what she wants to do
6014869 i didnt tell her directly about us jack i didnt have to shes been working for me for us since before my mother died all right
6014870 since mrs kellers doing the laundry and everything you can tell me where the spare sheets are
6014871 i think she must have been early this morning i heard someone but i waited till the coast was clear to go down there
6014872 dont be insulted but she really does make the best coffee ive ever tasted i should ask her the secret sometime
6014873 i need to call chicago today and im thinking maybe id better not do it from your phone
6014874 yeah but i was thinking of telling her i was still in norfolk
6014875 we havent had time to really get into this since ive been home but we need to i want to make some plans
6014876 while youre out i think you should call paul davis too
6014877 whats happened what you heard from maybourne what the navys done to you and about this beating i dont think any of this is an accident jack and i know you dont either
6014878 i didnt say this but my god i hope you know it thank you for coming back for risking all this for taking care of me
6014879 i dont have to be back in norfolk for another ten days and i dont mind telling you im not looking forward to going out to sea again if thats whats next and i dont like leaving you here alone
6014880 this is wrong what simmons is doing its abusing his power its abusing his mandate its just wrong im not a security risk ive done nothing to merit this
6014881 you look kind of like a pirate now with that cut on your head
6014882 i am angry im so angry i dont know what to do i dont have anywhere to put it if i thought about it too much id get up and start punching things its wrong its all wrong you know i agree with you were not hurting anyone weve both been doing our jobs doing our best doing whatever we were ordered to do its just
6014883 i want you to talk to paul i do want you to tell him everything thats happened im angry too angry beyond words that ive dragged you into my feud with simmons hes ruined your career and im afraid jack im afraid it wont stop with this
6014884 i never thought id say this but the more i think about it the more i realize i cant accept this and i cant let it go i cant pretend its not happening
6014885 i want to stop him jack im not going to let him destroy you im not going to let him hurt you any more than he already has
6014886 like you havent been hurt lets not forget about that
6014887 im kinda out of practice with all that count of monte cristo stuff
6014888 hes abusing his power jack hes the one in the wrong here not us
6014889 you know i dont blame you for any of this
6014890 maybe you were already on simmons shit list but you didnt cause what happened to me
6014891 i know you feel that way but the fact remains if i hadnt dragged you to washington in january he would never have known you existed and youd still be with the blue angels
6014892 he might have been following you all along just waiting for something he could use against you or someone
6014893 i just love you jack i love you so much i wont i
6014894 heres the thing if i was going to be able to walk away from this id have done it by now six months out there on that ship six months of knowing they were watching me setting me up and i still i thought about you every day whether i wanted to or not i missed you i was just waiting to come back thats all i was doing
6014895 well no not really im thinking the thing to do here is for me to get down on one knee except you know i cant
6014896 something happened on the ship then you didnt tell me that before
6014897 oh nothing really they set some idiot up to come at me to get some proof i was really a
6014898 i could call maybourne too he knows simmons and i think hes willing to help us
6014899 we had a thing a long time ago not like this
6014900 i wasnt in love with him or anything but i guess he still i dunno wishes me well
6014901 you have to wonder all this effort all this frantic digging by the fbi to expose the evil homosexuals were such a danger
6014902 so were going to find a way to stop him and by that i mean were going to find a way to prevent him from hurting either of us in any way ever again
6014903 sounds like a goal now all we need is a plan
6014904 ill go make those phone calls pick up a few things get back before visiting hours start
6014905 im sorry jack im sorry you were dragged into this it really is all my fault
6014906 someone named jackson in memphis johnny do you recognize that address
6014907 i would have been worried except you kept writing to me regular as clockwork what happened
6014908 how ya been buddy i thought you were overseas what a pleasant surprise
6014909 oh sure sure word gets around you know how it is hey im about to go into a meeting give me the number where youre at there let me call you back in ten all right jack
6014910 well give me a little credit maybourne i dont exactly have your home number never did in fact
6014911 dammit you called me at work jack that was bad
6014912 well i think things are about to get beyond bad in fact they already have still listening for auld lang syne
6014913 keep talking you can take my legendary soft heartedness as read
6014914 glad to hear it so you knew they put me on the forrestal
6014915 guess where doctor jackson was when i got back here four days ago in the hospital
6014916 he was beaten up at a voter registration rally by the cops he says
6014917 what the hell was he doing at a voter registration rally
6014918 hello harry memphis the negro cause surely your lords and masters have heard of it
6014919 meet me in the train station in richmond noon the day after tomorrow
6014920 go get me the vaseline from the bathroom i have an idea
6014921 we dont i cant i dont want to hurt you
6014922 im not going to be doing any of the work
6014923 i want to fuck you tonight go get the vaseline
6014924 kneel there over my legs where i can reach you
6014925 dont really have one we my friend and i were just trying to think of all the ways we might come up with some leverage on our mutual ah target
6014926 unless we bring in my friends old contact in the air force were not really sure what kind of leverage there is going to be but weve got to put a stop to the harassment my friend was in the hospital for a week harry
6014927 but luckily for you i have something but like i said im going to want a favor in return a big favor
6014928 and i have a feeling your friend has some contacts who can pave the way his contact whom you mentioned in the air force for starters
6014929 out of the country and out of the bureau and to do that i need a new name
6014930 i can get you some very good leverage against the target but in exchange heres what i want a new passport
6014931 it will involve photos photos that youre going to take
6014932 before you say any more youll want to take a look inside and i do hope for your sake that you believed what i told you and came alone
6014933 from that scumbag maybourne cash from you my honorable discharge
6014934 you want me to contact maybourne with a figure or do you want to handle it
6014935 i cant buy you a discharge from the united states navy you unspeakable piece of crap and by the way blackmails a felony if you didnt already know that
6014936 because i dont think youll be liking the consequences much
6014937 ill be back at the base in norfolk tomorrow and ill be expecting my discharge papers from my c o there by the end of the week also it goes without saying that nothing else is going to happen to doctor jackson are we clear
6014938 say i agree to all that say i get you your discharge what then
6014939 then ill call you at your office and tell you where you can pick up the negatives all of them
6014940 someday maybe we can go out for a drink and i can tell you the whole story
6014941 just write to my mom in chicago shell have it
6014942 daniel groaned and the dirty words the tone made jack groan in response and rock into daniel that much harder
6014943 youre not going to be happy just hanging around here and being a kept man
6014944 even though you know that would be fine with me and you do make a mean grilled cheese sandwich as i have recently had occasion to find out
6014945 seriously have you thought about what you want to do now
6014946 not really ever since i got back from that last hitch at sea ive been kinda
6014947 i could relocate here approach the commercial airlines about work
6014948 but im thinking although youre right about the opportunities in flying here that for the time being it might be a wise idea for us to lie low so to speak im actually thinking that we should leave completely for awhile and david has given me the perfect opportunity
6014949 david jordan the department head at memphis state before before you went back east this last time when we were kicking around our plans what to do about simmons before your old friend came through with his
6014950 david made me an offer he and paul had been worried about me they talked when you had paul call him
6014951 david told me how worried he was after i had been beaten and he offered to let me go to egypt in august in his place when he and sarah gardner had called on me here after you brought me home from the hospital they told me they had received confirmation that they had a new permit for a potential site for deir el bahri and that david had planned to go himself like he did in 55 but he offered to take my classes and send me in his place to get me out of harms way
6014952 sorry its arabic its a burial site in egypt that davids been interested in for years he and some of his colleagues from the u k detail not important now unless you eventually you know want the ancient egypt briefing anyway my point is we could go both of us
6014953 we could move to cairo for a while i know someone there from years back who would be a good patron for us someone with good connections with the new government he could get you a job you could fly and i could dig and well
6014954 i dont dare say that yet jack i dont want to jinx this
6014955 got to see italy and spain and a bit of greece not egypt
6014956 you heard bud powells gone to france left the states permanently
6014957 no no i really cant not with whats happening to the negroes here and im afraid its going to get worse before it gets better
6014958 this is full circle i guess tomorrow is it so

6014998 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
6014999 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
6015000 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
6015001 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
6015002 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
6015003 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
6015004 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
6015005 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
6015006 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
6015007 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
6015008 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
6015009 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
6015010 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
6015011 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
6015012 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
6015013 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
6015014 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
6015015 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
6015016 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
6015017 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
6015018 au del du profit nous avons un devoir patriotique vis vis de la nation

6015020 wenn ich jetzt nicht aufh re gehe ich zugrunde ich will nie mehr musik machen
6015021 it just doesnt feel real in fact the whole last week doesnt feel real in the final i just tried to focus on the fact that my speed was the fastest from the qualification rounds i tried to stay calm and do the best job i could
6015022 it doesnt matter who the rival is you just do the best you can in the qualification she was actually a little bit slower than usual so that gave me a bit extra confidence
6015023 i was an absolute mess at some points and it felt as if id been waiting for ever to get my chance everybody was getting gold and i just wanted to be part of the team i didnt want to think about the outcome i just wanted to think about the process i didnt even allow myself to think about winning or failing
6015024 there are just three events for the women in cycling comparison with seven for the men its got to be corrected somehow it doesnt make sense
6015025 you cross the line and all the pressure and expectation evaporates and its like nothing else youve ever felt until that point youve only been thinking about the process and the performance breaking it down to the technical elements thats why the emotions come out at the end it just erupts out of you
6015026 for them to be able to share the moment it couldnt be any better
6015027 through thick and thin theyve been there supporting me from bmx racing rugby rowing and all the different sports theyve been there on the sidelines cheering me on its pretty cool to be able to go up at the end of the race and just give them a big hug
6015028 if i had made any mistakes tonight i would have got beaten with this standard of competition particularly from jason
6015029 hes such a talented kid so skilful so fast for 20 years of age hes also got it up top as well mentally hes very sharp keeps it cool he dealt with these games like a veteran so hes definitely one you can rely on for the future i hope i can hang on to him until london hes on his way up thats for sure ive been training with him all year and i could see him coming through i half thought i might meet him in the final here
6015030 i was just trying to keep up with bradley and the rest of the team
6015031 youve got to win more than one gold medal to get a look in nowadays winning three golds feels pretty special its just bizarre because multiple gold medals are for people like steve redgrave or matt pinsent or michael phelps you just dont think of yourself in the same company as them i havent achieved what theyve achieved
6015032 our massage therapist luc de wilde is belgian so he got some belgian beer and put it into my recovery drinks bottle
6015033 so the first drink i had wasnt a protein drink it was something else i have to be careful because i still have to do doping control the last time i had alcohol was the last night of the world championships in march
6015034 there is no suggestion that she is guilty of taking drugs to enhance her performance or otherwise indeed this case can be viewed in all the circumstances as a busy young athlete being forgetful
6015035 i truly believe that i feel like the system was designed to catch cheats but caught a person with bad time management
6015036 why should this be spoilt it can be done only by someone who wants to spoil it im very happy with my performances and my three gold medals at three major championships including the commonwealth games
6015037 i believe there is a strong case for life bans for all dopers i dont want to hear about drugs i dont want to hear about cheaters most members of the team share that view i admire what great britain does you test positive and you cannot represent your country at the olympics i do think christine ohuruogu is fortunate to be here but her case is different she never had a positive test and to me she seems clean but i do think shes fortunate
6015038 but so long as you rest right eat right and train right you should be ok
6015039 i felt i had the best chance of achieving things in it
6015040 im really too small for rowing at 6ft 1in and i was more interested in cycling than rowing in cycling you have complete control and none of the hassle or dependency of being involved in a crew
6015041 we shouldnt feel hard done by its a shame the sport doesnt get more recognition but more medals will raise our profile
6015042 ive dedicated my life to getting to the olympics and winning a medal
6015043 i am not saying i will win but i believe i can
6015044 evidemment je ne suis pas daccord car cette mesure est une mesure qui une fois de plus ne r gle rien long terme
6015045 on va essayer de ne pas r percuter cette mesure dans nos tarifs cette ann e
6015046 je ne veux pas prendre dengagement pour les ann es qui viennent
6015047 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
6015048 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
6015049 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
6015050 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
6015051 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
6015052 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
6015053 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
6015054 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
6015055 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
6015056 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
6015057 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
6015058 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
6015059 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
6015060 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
6015061 lloyd told me the race would be won in the final 15 metres and thats what i kept thinking about
6015062 as far as im concerned you train for the three days of a major championships you dont train for grand prix events or one off races if you cant prepare yourself for those three days then what are you wasting your time training for
6015063 christine had an awesome finish and i just couldnt hold her off
6015064 as far as im concerned im here and ive won a gold medal im happy with what ive done
6015065 yes its something ive given thought to but its a long way away it will be great if i can say ill be there but ill take each year as it comes and deal with it when i get there
6015066 you have to realise language is alive its constantly developing
6015067 lann e derni re explique t il en langue bambara nous ndlr propri taires de vergers riions tous pareille p riode mais cette ann e la moisson est moins satisfaisante mais on na pas se plaindre cest comme a cest s r que lann e prochaine nous allons nous r jouir de nouveau

6015069 a cette m me p riode en cas de bagarre dans le march on se sert des mangues vertes comme armes les bagarreurs se jettent les mangues dessus
6015070 a cette poque l il y avait beaucoup de mangues orodara mais le march tait presquinexistant
6015071 les producteurs de mangues de la r gion de orodara ne sont pas encore bien form s pour fournir dafani la mangue de qualit quil lui faut et au moment o il faut
6015072 des coop ratives existent avoue t il mais elles ont d j montr leurs limites dans le domaine du suivi des vergers
6015073 tant que les producteurs iront en rangs dispers s pr vient il il ny aura de rentabilit ni pour eux ni pour dafani et dans le meilleur des cas cest dafani qui pourra la longue profiter de cette inorganisation
6015074 tout le monde ne se comporte pas de fa on quitable sur le march
6015075 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6015076 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6015077 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6015078 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned russian president dmitry medvedev said last month as the missile talks moved to a close
6015079 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6015080 i am super happy to be competing in this years trials i am looking forward to getting one of the two open wildcard spots
6015081 with my wedding a few hours after the trials it would be great to win a wildcard spot before i head off to get married but win or lose it is still going to be a great day
6015082 the u s open is the perfect stage for these exciting young competitors to showcase their talent
6015083 we take great pride in advancing the life experiences of young people and giving promising locals like brett simpson proven talents like sunny garcia and grom phenom kolohe andino the chance to win a spot to go up against the worlds best at trestles in september is a great way to do just that
6015084 this is an important time for these surfers to experience what it takes to excel at this level
6015085 each athlete hopes to get the chance to take on the worlds best but they will have to make it through difficult conditions at huntington beach in front of thousands of spectators first
6015086 i deserve to play a lot the rest of the way
6015087 au nom de dieu le cl ment le mis ricordieux
6015088 i have no qualms at all about saying that were pretty elitist i know thats a word that doesnt maybe sit comfortably with a lot of british culture but thats what we are we want to win absolutely everything
6015089 a lot of the other nations talk about the money we have but its not a slot machine
6015090 you dont just put lottery money in the top pull the lever and a load of gold medals come out at the bottom
6015091 if it was everybody would be doing it prior to lottery funding we had won one olympic medal in 76 years in track cycling weve been trying to do this for a long long time and this isnt just an overnight success weve been working very hard at it
6015092 thats whats scared the rest of the world they knew chris hoy bradley wiggins vicky pendleton and our pursuit team were good but when they see a 20 year old like jason kenny winning silver in the individual sprint that really scared everybody
6015093 the ones who think they know it all will be the ones who probably arent performing to the best of their ability we dont know it all but we always want to learn from others its that quest for knowledge that goes with success
6015094 i went over there to win the tour de france
6015095 i grew up in north wales and i was pretty naive i knew after the second year that i wouldnt make it but i still tried
6015096 i just manage i conduct an orchestra of people who have more expertise than i have im interested in excellence in human beings

6015118 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
6015119 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
6015120 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

6015123 theres been lots of speculation every day and weve been linked with hundreds of players and i dont think well be signing all of them
6015124 ive no comment to make on speculation if we sign any decent players well release a statement but theres no point me talking about players who might or might not be coming to the football club
6015125 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6015126 its out of my hands weve made some great offers for players and good deals with clubs im quite relaxed about it
6015127 if players want to come and we can take them to another level fantastic but if they want to stay at the clubs theyre at good luck to them its not a major problem
6015128 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6015129 ive brought lots of players in and if i feel theres an offer that we think is a good offer obviously id consider it
6015130 i cant say anything concrete since i dont really know myself the situation
6015131 everything is still being discussed maybe spartak have already made a decision but i havent decided one way or the other
6015132 moreover the transfer to england which everyone is talking about would be a big problem for my family as we have a young child so we need to discuss it properly
6015133 i dont know because i have never been at a foreign club you need to try something first in order to know
6015134 on the one hand its easier as a pair but on the other alone the situation forces you to get used to new conditions quicker both language and life
6015135 everything will depend on what kind of offer will be made to the club and to me my move to a top club definitely would reflect well on the image of spartak

6015167 we are asked to pay 150 250 to get refugee ids and most of us end up getting none because we dont even have money to buy a loaf of bread once a day
6015168 in some instances oromo refugees are told that they would get cards only if they produce proof of employment from the sudanese employers

6015179 mta is the oldest oromo civil society organization established in early 1960s to advance the socio economic development of the marginalized and repressed oromo people under emperor haile sillassie

6015181 i spent five and a half years in prison during the reign of the derg military junta
6015182 i was swept from the street and taken to the area of police headquarters which was under construction in the capital city then they confiscated my bag and forced me to take off all my clothes except for my underwear at gun point they took me to the edge of the big holes dug for construction and threatened to burry me alive if i did not give up calling the meeting about finfinnees being the indigenous center of the oromo people and i said to them i prefer you take my life instead of doing what you demand they held a gun at me and shouted that they would kill my son and my wife if i did not comply
6015183 the main problem in the court system is the judges keep changing and every time the newer judge starts studying and working on your case from scratch this is deliberately made to extend our stay in jail without being tried or one judge finds you not guilty and when you walk out thinking you are free the police will arrest you and put you in jail again

6015213 northern ireland will be a tough test and have real talent in kyle lafferty and david healy
6015214 they beat georgia 4 1 recently and that shows their capabilities
6015215 but were at home and must have belief be positive and take the game to them because thats what well try to do in macedonia
6015216 i will ask the midfielders to play as high up as possible and get into scoring positions
6015217 paul hartley darren fletcher scott brown and barry robson are all capable of getting goals its vital to get into the habit of scoring as world cup qualifying might be tight so a few goals could make the difference
6015218 the game against northern ireland will be a difficult test for us ahead of the world cup qualifying campaign
6015219 like us they had a good euros and were particularly impressive against the eventual winners of the tournament spain

6015229 i mean no matter how you study it its just a piece of earth dirt basically wet with its surface a bit less wet than its inside for being a bit cooked in the sun why did it appear from the heart of the river in the first place and more amazingly its wandering ive seen it go with the flow to the north then against it to the south and a bit to the east then to the west it never merged with the mainland and it didnt break into pieces
6015230 you dont get it do you the river flow moves the island one dust or mud piece at a time but it doesnt just dissolve it remains together and the pieces the island lets go it makes sure it grabs one or more to replace it it is alive it persists ok you know what i think why it is staying together to do something to fulfill a reason a reason that all its particles need to fulfill thats why they came together a reason and thats why they move together this common reason is what we call soul or spirit this island is alive i tell you this island is alive its the only sense i can make why all its parts went together in all those travels and stayed together
6015231 he created all humans from earth that was cooked like pottery thats what the quran teaches and before it the egyptian wisdom
6015232 breath you forgot breath soul god brought the earth and created people by blowing soul into the mud
6015233 so it is alive i wont argue so why dont you call it hayaa then
6015234 its not its aliveness that awed me but its purpose its unique story how its aliveness makes it move all around to find something to do something that we as humans could barely understand and we can barely communicate with it and yet if we could aah if only we could what story would we hear
6015235 i have been watching this island for years now and i am just starting to realize how amazing its story is

6015244 if youre going to keep making plays youre going to stay there if you mess up the other guy is going to go in

6015253 many of our friends were not heavily into art and they thought we were a little nuts anyway
6015254 few other people went up to our dressing room but i walked by the piece every time i went to the bathroom i thought it was the most deeply affecting work of art i had ever seen it struck very deep into me
6015255 ed once told me that if he ever made a piece of art that was it i thought it was the essence of everything he had it worked as a drawing as a sculpture even the colors for me it was also the extreme underside of beauty

6015259 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
6015260 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
6015261 its revealing that barack obama attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
6015262 what sen obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice
6015263 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
6015264 im not sure this is the most cost effective use of these funds
6015265 sometimes an experiment like this is just that an experiment and you dont find out until later that it doesnt really work out too well
6015266 there was a sense that they needed to put some money toward the problem and do that fairly quickly before the election
6015267 thats probably why there wasnt as much of a consultative process as there might have been had they had more time to put something together and really vet it out
6015268 later i discovered that this was a result of the subprime meltdown
6015269 acorns interest is in making sure that the cities that are developing plans to use this money put it to good use

6015307 theyre just asking me to decribe myself tell them my hobbies etc how hard can it be right
6015308 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6015309 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6015310 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6015311 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6015312 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6015313 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6015314 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6015315 who are open to doing something on the production side
6015316 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6015317 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6015318 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6015319 our fit out housing and maintenance businesses have all performed well during the year despite a difficult economic climate and we remain focussed on achieving market leadership in these key sectors
6015320 there is a concern the construction sector is an area of non compliance with our security legislation and where the wiser criminal element rests
6015321 it is not only happening in liverpool you hear about it here
6015322 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6015323 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6015324 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6015327 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6015328 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6015329 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6015330 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6015331 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6015332 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6015333 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6015334 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6015335 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6015336 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6015337 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6015338 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6015339 i think its just a technical bounce and the trend is still downward

6015344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6015345 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6015346 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6015347 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6015348 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6015349 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6015350 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6015351 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6015352 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6015353 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6015354 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6015355 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6015356 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6015357 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6015358 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6015359 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6015360 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6015361 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6015362 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6015363 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6015364 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6015365 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6015366 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6015367 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6015368 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6015369 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6015370 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6015371 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6015372 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6015373 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6015378 usain was one of the athletes we recruited in 2003 he was just a young 16 year old kid and hes progressed quite well
6015379 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6015380 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6015381 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6015382 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6015383 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6015384 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6015385 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6015386 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6015387 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6015388 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6015389 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6015390 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6015391 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6015392 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6015393 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6015394 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6015395 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6015396 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6015397 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6015398 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6015399 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6015400 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6015413 as soon as i found out about this security issue we acted immediately to shut down any access to this information
6015414 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6015415 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6015416 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6015417 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6015418 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6015446 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tail walks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
6015447 about five years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behaviour but does so with much greater regularity than billie a third adult female dolphin has also been seen tail walking
6015448 if tail walking is a true cultural behaviour it will gradually spread through the local population probably by being adopted by youngsters
6015449 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
6015450 these are the main factors and that is why the covers are so effective
6015451 landmarks can be semantic for instance a theatre is a cultural landmark
6015452 there are also visual landmarks with a colour and shape that makes them distinctive and structural landmarks with a strategic position on the edge of a square or at an intersection

6015456 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6015457 last years devastating mill fire reminded us all of the bravery and heroism of the men and women of the uxbridge fire department
6015458 this funding will help the department to build up its emergency response capabilities we all salute these courageous men and women for their dedication and their service
6015459 this new truck will have the capacity to meet our needs and the equipment that we can consolidate onto one truck
6015460 these two vehicles have been built by members of the fire department but they dont meet the design and construction criteria of modern equipment
6015461 the grant from the federal government improves firefighter safety and improves service to the community with a dependable vehicle being used for the purpose it was built for
6015462 the uxbridge fire department is a team of trained professionals who are deeply committed to the public safety of their community
6015463 this federal grant will provide firefighters with the resources they need to continue to do their important work
6015464 the men and women of the uxbridge fire department deserve the best in equipment and this federal funding will help in the job they do so well
6015465 going through a recession the citizens are in dire need to pay their expenses for the winter
6015466 the water and sewer just went up another 30 percent and theyve gone up over 150 percent in the last few years
6015467 theyre fed up with all the water and sewer costs that theyre going to have to go without certain things in the wintertime be it food be it medical be it heat
6015468 a lot of the stuff we do is contaminated soil that is landfill acceptable
6015469 thats why im amazed when somebody says whod want to build an industrial park around a landfill
6015470 hate to see another town benefit first utilizing our infrastructure

6015473 make sure the job gets done as professionally and honestly as possible
6015474 one of my reasons too for kind of bowing out last year
6015475 i feel bad now because they said we can just cap it and seal it and we wont have to dig anything up it will never come back to haunt us and it already has and in a short period of time
6015476 i dont know if we got a bum bid or if we had a bad consultant or where the whole thing lies i really dont

6015489 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26

6015496 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6015497 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling

6015504 en un a o el ndice de cr ditos dudosos e impagados ha pasado del 0 7 al 1 6 del total el grado de provisionalidad sigue siendo confortable
6015505 si bien el sistema financiero espa ol est resistiendo bastante mejor que otros la crisis surgida de las hipotecas subprime norteamericanas no se libra de otro tal n de aquiles el r pido aumento de los morosos las cifras que acaba de hacer p blicas el banco de espa a lo ponen de manifiesto las cajas de ahorro son las entidades m s afectadas con un ndice que asciende al 1 91 frente al 1 28 que registran los bancos y el 1 59 de las cooperativas de cr dito
6015506 m s que las cifras es el ritmo de la morosidad lo que preocupa especialmente en el contexto de crecimiento cero que se anuncia en la poca del boom fueron numerosos los establecimientos financieros espa oles que rompieron sus propias normas de prudencia seg n la cual sus pr stamos hipotecarios no deb an sobrepasar el 80 del valor del inmueble no dudando a veces a conceder m s del 100 sabiendo que la subida continua del valor de activos inmobiliarios har a desque este porcentaje descendiera pero el fen meno est a punto de invertirse ahora que lso activos inmobiliarios est n a la baja
6015507 espa a no est amenazada por la crisis de las subprime porque el banco de espa a oblig al sector financiero a acumular junto a provisiones espec ficas que cubren riesgos concretos otras con car cter general para hacer frente a los avatares de la coyuntura tampoco se excluye que a partir de ahora las entidades de cr dito empiecen a utilizar de ahora en adelante el colch n protector que ellas les aseguran
6015508 espa a especialmente golpeada por la crisis inmobiliaria adopt en el transcurso de un consejo de ministros extraordinario un plan de 20 mil millones de euros para relanzar la econom a se aprob una serie de medidas para facilitar la financiaci n de las empresas y la construcci n de viviendas sociales para permitir que la econom a alcance un crecimiento del pib que est en torno al 3 en el a o 2010

6015510 una fuga radioactiva en una central nuclear espa ola localizada al noroeste de catalu a fue ocultada por los responsables de las instalaciones ahora el consejo de seguridad nuclear de aquel pa s propone multas muy pesadas la fuga ocurri el 26 de noviembre de 2007 solamente en abril del presente a o y casi por casualidad cuando un funcionario de la central sopl el secreto a un inspector de seguridad que terminaba su visita pero las investigaciones posteriores mostraron haber habido dispersi n de part culas radioactivas para el exterior de la central de cobalto 60
6015511 espa a quiere dejar bien claro que el incidente nuclear que envolvi la central de asc no se repetir y prometi aplicar una multa millonaria a iberdrola y a endesa por haber ocultado durante cuatro meses una fuga radioactiva en esta central de tarragona en catalu a en noviembre del a o pasado el consejo de seguridad nuclear propuso al ministerio de industria espa ol a quien cabe la decisi n una sanci n que podr llegar a los 22 5 millones de euros
6015512 el gobierno espa ol emprende firmes acciones por la fuga nuclear
6015513 tras varios meses de investigaci n el csn pidi al gobierno el martes que sancionara la planta i de asc por cuatro acusaciones de haber alterado las normas de seguridad por una fuga que tuvo lugar el pasado mes de noviembre el csn declar que a pesar de que ni la poblaci n ni el medio ambiente hab an sido perjudicados por la fuga la planta ubicada el noreste del puerto de tarragona no hab a ofrecido la informaci n adecuada ni hab a emprendido las acciones pertinentes para asegurar la seguridad p blica
6015514 las plantas nucleares se enfrentan a un incierto futuro en espa a pa s en el que la energ a nuclear es una causa perdida los dos partidos pol ticos mayoritarios en las elecciones de marzo prometieron reemplazar gradualmente las plantas en medio de un boom de fuentes de energ a renovables
6015515 diez d as despu s de su llegada los tanques rusos siguen en georgia y no muestran signos de retirarse una peque a columna abandon ayer la estrat gica ciudad de gori pero las tropas rusas segu an en el puerto de poti en el mar negro capturando a 20 soldados georgianos a golpe de pistola y acampados en igoeti a 20 millas de la capital tiflis no es probable que esto cambie habiendo firmado un acuerdo de alto el fuego que le exige retirarse a la posici n que ocupaba antes del ataque georgiano contra tsikhinvali el 7 de agosto rusia contin a desmantelando la maquinaria militar de georgia
6015516 en cuanto a las emociones el encuentro de la otan parec a un grupo de j venes que se siente desafiado por un l der rival algunos miembros estaban llenos de ira e indignaci n frente a rusia otros intentaban calmar la situaci n porque saben perfectamente que sus instrumentos son limitados y que de por s siempre van a volver a cruzarse en el camino del fuerte adversario el resultado ha sido esta declaraci n de la otan sobre el c ucaso un mensaje con el pu o en alto pero no un verdadero anuncio de lucha
6015517 el resultado de la reuni n de la otan es el m nimo absoluto de reacci n que se puede esperar al desprecio c nico de la soberan a georgiana por parte de rusia esto no puede impresionar a mosc a putin y compa a m s bien le tiene que dar la impresi n de que la otan es un tigre de papel sin unidad y nada seguro de si mismo
6015518 hasta ahora la resistencia de europa ha sido bastante limitada esto se tiene que acabar si no putin terminar vi ndose recompensado por su pol tica y alcanzar sus objetivos y estos son intimidar a los estados vecinos para que sigan la pol tica rusa y da en a la otan de modo que esta carezca de atractivo para georgia y ucrania esto no lo pueden permitir ni la otan ni la ue ni estados unidos los estados de europa oriental tienen que comprender que la venganza es un mal consejero y estados unidos tiene que regresar al multilateralismo visto as el conflicto en el c ucaso podr a servir para que no solamente los miembros de la otan vuelvan a cerrar filas
6015519 no conviene quemar los puentes que nos separan de rusia
6015520 el ministro belga de exteriores karel de gucht insisti ayer en la necesidad de encontrar soluciones urgentes a la pol tica energ tica europea el mayor desaf o de europa consiste en desarrollar una pol tica energ tica que nos convierta en menos dependientes de rusia de lo contrario la otan nunca estar en condiciones de jugar limpio con rusia pero independientemente de esta circunstancia tampoco conviene seguir la pol tica americana a favor de aislar a rusia si bien es cierto que mosc ocupa ilegalmente el territorio georgiano conviene recordar que occidente tampoco se apoy en el derecho internacional para reconocer la independencia de kosovo
6015521 en un intento por recuperar su autoridad en la escena internacional todo apunta a que rusia pretende dejar bien claro a occidente que ya no tolera que le coloquen ante hechos consumados que interpreta la ampliaci n de la otan como una amenaza y que considera la instalaci n del escudo antimisiles americano como una humillaci n no conviene reavivar las tensiones entre occidente y rusia no s lo porque nuestro abastecimiento energ tico depende en gran medida de esta ltima sino sobre todo porque rusia es un asociado pol tico y econ mico insoslayable en un mundo globalizado
6015522 el estado mayor explica las causas de la lenta retirada de las tropas rusas de georgia
6015523 ayer por la tarde el ministro de asuntos exteriores de rusia serguei lavrov formul por primera vez plazos concretos para la retirada de las tropas rusas de georgia pienso que ocupar tres o cuatro d as poco m s tarde y en conversaci n telef nica con el presidente de francia nicol s sarkozy dmitri medvedev declar hacia el 22 de agosto una vez que se habiliten los puestos de control y los lugares de acuartelamiento parte de las fuerzas de paz ser retirada a una zona temporal de seguridad precisada por una resoluci n de la comisi n de control mixta para la regulaci n del conflicto en el a o 1999 el resto del contingente entregado al refuerzo de las fuerzas de paz se retirar al territorio de osetia del sur y a rusia en washington siguen sin creer que el repliegue ya ha comenzado y contin an incriminando a mosc sin ning n ceremonial
6015524 la secretaria de estado estadounidense no consigue inclinar a la otan abiertamente en contra de rusia
6015525 la casa blanca ha dejado de cohibirse en sus declaraciones y ha comenzado a hablar con su lenguaje acostumbrado de camino a bruselas para entrevistarse con los ministros de exteriores de los pa ses de la otan condoleeza rice prometi que los pa ses de la alianza castigar n a rusia por atacar a georgia pero no lo han conseguido en el mejor de los casos una reprimenda bajo presi n de washington los estados que pertenecen a la alianza no han roto el esp ritu corporativo de esta organizaci n sin embargo se han esforzado por reducir al m nimo las consecuencias del ataque del s ptimo de caballer a planeado contra rusia como resultado la declaraci n adoptada por el consejo de ministros de exteriores de la otan contiene multitud de reticencias que todas las partes implicadas pueden interpretar en inter s propio
6015526 mosc y bruselas han estado a punto de romper relaciones
6015527 rusia y la otan estuvieron ayer al borde de la ruptura total de relaciones

6015529 palabras huecas as es c mo valor mosc ayer las cr ticas de la otan por la continuada ocupaci n de georgia por rusia es la ltima situaci n embarazosa para una alianza que sigue sin saber muy bien c mo responder a la agresi n rusa lo m ximo que los ministros de la otan consiguieron acordar en su reuni n de bruselas de ayer fue que no pueden seguir como si no pasara nada con rusia no se dio ning n paso para acelerar el ingreso de georgia en la otan ni ninguna promesa para ayudar a la maltrecha democracia a reconstruir sus defensas entretanto rusia encontr ayer nuevas formas de burlarse de occidente y castigar a los georgianos que est n cumpliendo el alto el fuego despu s de intercambiar prisioneros con georgia las tropas rusas exhibieron a 20 georgianos con los ojos vendados a los que hab an capturado y retomaron un puerto petrol fero crucial en poti
6015530 las promesas de mosc no parecen significar nada mientras rusia segu a bombardeando ciudades y bases militares georgianas la semana pasada despu s de acordar un alto el fuego el kremlin repiti ayer su promesa de retirar sus tropas de territorio georgiano pero dej la mayor parte de sus fuerzas all mosc cree claramente que tiene m s capacidad para humillar a occidente con este conflicto que para ser humillado a juzgar por la d bil respuesta de la otan ayer tiene raz n
6015531 depende de ee uu decidir si quiere la relaci n con rusia que se merecen los dos pueblos la realidad geopol tica con la que tendremos que tratar nos forzar inevitablemente a cooperar para emprender la v a de la cooperaci n no ser a mala idea hacer algo muy simple admitir por un momento que el curso de la historia no ha de depender por completo de lo que est diciendo un presidente georgiano s lo reconocer que un l der democr ticamente electo puede mentir justo admitir que tienes otras fuentes de informaci n y otros objetivos para dar forma a la pol tica exterior
6015532 se suceden las derrotas electorales cae el n mero de militantes y se debilitan los v nculos con los sindicatos hace tan s lo siete a os trece gobiernos de la ue estaban dirigidos por socialistas hoy ste s lo es el caso de espa a portugal y no se sabe por cu nto tiempo de gran breta a evidentemente debemos analizar estos resultados con precauci n las elecciones nacionales de cada pa s tienen sus particularidades pero eso no quita para que se est reafirmando una tendencia general y ser a absurdo negarlo
6015533 la crisis de la socialdemocracia proviene seg n el ltimo an lisis de su incapacidad de poner en marcha una respuesta europea a los desaf os de la globalizaci n su renovaci n pasa por el relanzamiento y la reorientaci n de europa tanto es as que el crecimiento fuerte y duradero la protecci n de los asalariados frente a todos los riesgos locales la lucha contra el calentamiento clim tico el dominio de la inmigraci n la regulaci n del capitalismo globalizado exigen una uni n m s voluntaria m s ambiciosa y m s social
6015534 el mes pasado el gobierno italiano declar el estado de emergencia como reacci n a un intenso crecimiento en la inmigraci n ilegal el gobierno de silvio berlusconi ha desplegado 3 000 soldados armados en las calles de las nueve ciudades principales para proporcionar mayor seguridad p blica el problema es que no hay evidencias de esa ola de criminalidad s lo es una percepci n las medidas tomadas por italia han sido fuertemente criticadas por el comisario de derechos humanos del consejo de europa y por el alto comisionado de las naciones unidas para los refugiados durante el fin de semana el papa advirti sobre recientes ejemplos de racismo
6015535 acusaciones de racismo no se deben hacer impunemente pero el discurso difamatorio de algunos miembros del gobierno y las medidas dirigidas contra grupos tnicos como los gitanos tienen un terrible precedente hist rico otros pa ses como espa a est n manejando una proporci n incluso m s grande de inmigrantes sin recurrir a ninguna de estas medidas
6015536 afganist n no es una simple misi n de mantenimiento del orden es una guerra que nos cuesta caro tanto en dinero como en vidas humanas el dram tico endurecimiento del conflicto constatado estos ltimos meses es preocupante no debemos olvidar lo que est en juego ya que tiene una importancia extrema tanto para europa como para estados unidos se trata ante todo de luchar contra el terrorismo se trata adem s y especialmente para francia de aportar un testimonio de solidaridad trasatl ntico
6015537 afganist n es el frente central de la lucha contra el terrorismo seguir si ndolo en los pr ximos a os estados unidos necesita el apoyo europeo para ganar el tercer reto no es el menos importante ya que un regreso al orden talib n en afganist n contribuir a a desestabilizar al vecino pakist n islamabad tiene varias decenas de ojivas nucleares que no deben bajo ning n concepto caer en manos de terroristas para actuar eficazmente contra los talibanes se necesita sobre todo reforzar formar y equipar al ej rcito afgano los soldados occidentales s lo podr n salir del atolladero afgano sin dar la impresi n de haber perdido la guerra dejando fuerzas locales capaces de detener a los talibanes

6015547 our global distribution and marketing platform is uniquely positioned to help them accelerate the growth of their fan base and maximize their earnings across all their potential revenue streams
6015548 a live nation situation is unique because they actually have the facility to put artists in venues they have a ticketing service effective next year and they have their own merchandising company
6015549 as the deals scale down to newer artists splits will be different and nets will be defined differently
6015550 most companies dont have the venues they dont have the merchandising so that raises the question of whether artists should give up those rights

6015656 this is uncouth behaviour showing no respect at all for the national flag what is there to be angry with the malaysian flag
6015657 if there are malaysians who want to take up the idea that came from the pro opposition blogger they are insulting this important national symbol flag
6015658 its all in the blog only he can do a good job hes simply creating trouble by coming up with dubious stories

6015722 this negative trend of child deaths has not recorded any significant changes in the national infant child and under five mortality rates since the early 1990s

6015724 we are afraid a trend is emerging we call it the running mate identity crisis

6015736 if the voters register becomes an issue of contention among political parties the election results may be disputed leading to violence
6015737 it is instructive that nearly all stakeholders including ec itself agree that the exercise could have been better organized
6015738 this in the future will forestall the unpleasant episodes observed
6015739 codeo reports in 2000 and 2004 had strongly recommended that both the ncce and the ec must take voter civic education seriously especially during the election year but these were apparently ignored
6015740 codeo commends the political parties for their mass mobilization of potential registrants and their commitment to and vigilance over the entire exercise
6015741 the ncce must collaborate with the ec to mount an intensive voter civic education campaign for the 2008 elections particularly towards the forthcoming exhibition of the voters register and beyond

6015782 we created a number of institutions in the wake of world war ii to deal with the situation
6015783 and what senator mccain wants to begin a dialogue about is do we need new structures and new institutions both internally in the us government and externally to recognize that the situation we face now is very very different than the one we faced during the cold war
6015784 there are some whove moved into his camp who scare me
6015785 a modern day oss could draw together specialists in unconventional warfare covert action operators and experts in anthropology advertising and other relevant disciplines
6015786 like the original oss this would be a small nimble can do organization
6015787 meet the threats of the twenty first century in a time of war much as the oss was created in a time of war
6015788 an organization created to meet the needs of the cold war and hang out in embassies and try to recruit a major or two or deal with walk in defectors
6015789 i would not recommend a new agency that is set up parallel to the cia all of those things can be done within the boundaries of the cia
6015790 anyone who thinks that the agency today is a nimble can do organization has a different view than senator mccain does
6015791 the united states will do whatever it must to guarantee the security of the american people
6015792 theyre talking about a body that essentially would circumvent the un and would take authority to act in the name of the international community sometimes using force
6015793 well its very easy to predict that the russians and chinese would view this as a threat
6015794 i think its fair to assume that hes most influenced by his neoconservative advisers
6015795 the first thing i would do is make sure we have a missile defense system in place in czechoslovakia sic and poland and i dont care what putins objections are to it
6015796 mccain says nato ought to include abkhazia and south ossetia which are not under the control of the current georgian government
6015797 which if not a prescription for war with russia is at least a prescription for conflict with russia
6015798 we must be prepared to back up these measures with american military force if the existence of such rogue states threatens americas interests and values
6015799 he does believe in a way that george w bush never really did in the use of power military power above all to change the world in americas image if you thought george bush was bad when it comes to the use of military force wait till you see john mccain he believes this his advisers believe this hes surrounded himself with people who believe it and ill take him at his word
6015800 hes bought into the completely fallacious notion that were in a global struggle of us versus them he calls it the transcendental threat of extreme islam
6015801 but its a silly argument to think that this is either an ideological or a material struggle on a par with the ones against nazi germany or soviet communism
6015802 theres no doubt in my mind once saddam is gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
6015803 i dont think youre going to have to see the scale of numbers of troops that we saw back in 1991
6015804 there were many encounters with the presidents senior advisers and with the president on this issue
6015805 it was a very lonely time he went out there for us
6015806 other countries could be in turmoil other countries could be threatening iraq it could be an external threat that we need to have troops there for la south korea la japan
6015807 i understand your readers may think its some sort of malevolent imperialist conspiracy
6015808 there is only one thing worse than a military solution and that my friends is a nuclear armed iran
6015809 the regime must understand that they cannot win a showdown with the world
6015810 he would employ military force to the exclusion of other options

6016052 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
6016053 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
6016054 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
6016055 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
6016056 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
6016057 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
6016058 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
6016059 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy
6016060 as i am sure all of you have heard the release of googles open source operating system is right around the corner
6016061 our findings suggestthat diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type oftreatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may beimportant in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects withdiabetes mellitus
6016062 in contrast late onset of diabetesmellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlleddiabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect

6016064 we cant help but be concerned though we dont know whats out there
6016065 all you hear is reports of asbestos in the area and whatever else was sprayed from that blast site
6016066 theres no telling what the pigeon could have eaten an hour before it died or even a day before it died
6016067 but asbestos wouldnt have caused anything id be very very surprised if it did
6016068 this birds death isnt likely to pose any health risks to the community
6016069 they will be turned over to canadian police for further investigation
6016070 we know there are organized groups that steal vehicles based on orders placed
6016071 people in some of these poorer countries want basic transport
6016072 were looking to talk to anyone who has had any contact with this individual
6016073 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college
6016074 at some point if its going to totally put a familys finances in jeopardy rationality needs to factor in
6016075 our interest is always in pushing more eyeballs keyboards and mice onto those targets getting them tested filing bugs getting the bugs fixed and generally just improving the quality of free and open source software overall
6016076 with rpm 4 6 there will be additional features for auto discovery of codecs fonts and applications
6016077 so when mime types define are discovered youll be able to have them automatically installed
6016078 its a system review and auditing tool that allows users to see if a system configuration has any security flaws
6016079 its also usable as a pretty full featured intrusion detection system define tool too
6016080 although ive talked to people about wubi in the long run because of our communitys goal its not something were likely to include
6016081 our people dont want to spend time on a technology that doesnt really give people a reason to want to switch from proprietary software
6016082 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
6016083 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
6016084 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
6016085 initially we approached the various chinese museums asking to borrow works but none of them was permitted
6016086 it was the ministry of culture that refused we were only told unofficially by people in government the reason was because this was the year of the olympics and the cultural revolution is a sensitive subject
6016087 we made the decision to proceed because it was too important an exhibition
6016088 this period of recent history has had an enormous impact on chinese art and we want to help people to understand this had the chinese museums been able to lend we would have had more works
6016089 although with 250 objects in the exhibition it has not affected our ability to show what actually happened during the period
6016090 we are trying to present a nuanced idea of what went on in china at this time
6016091 at the time i felt that there was no difference between me and the renaissance painters they painted jesus i painted mao
6016092 there is a perception that the cultural revolution is a sensitive period and it is to be avoided
6016093 but many in the chinese art world feel it is time to look at this period again
6016094 magicians have developed powerful cognitive principles and intuitions about attention and awareness that are not understood scientifically
6016095 weve been able to learn more about cognition from magicians who have developed illusions that trick audiences
6016096 the collaboration on this project has led to many exciting insights to help us understand the brains underlying cognition

6016130 we are seeing a temporary respite from the u s dollar strength that we have witnessed whenever you see the size move that we have seen it is not untoward for the market to take a breath and have a temporary pause before the next bout of u s dollar strength resumes
6016131 we knew it was going to be a bear for us to score enough runs for the formula to work in our favor
6016132 well it was a good feeling knowing it was going to go out

6016157 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
6016158 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
6016159 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are
6016160 it is hard for us to play to think about football considering what is happening in georgia
6016161 but maybe things are starting to get better and within a few days the russians will have left
6016162 it is hard for us but we have to play the game
6016163 we cannot allow ourselves to feel that because of what is happening that we are not ready for the game we have to play
6016164 the manager has asked us if we are ready because he needs to know
6016165 but we have all said we will play we want to send a message to russia that we can do this
6016166 we also want to show our people and our supporters who will be in the stadium
6016167 we will play the match as a message to the world that georgia is capable of doing so
6016168 more than 2 000 soldiers have been killed plus people in the villages maybe 5 000 in all it is terrible
6016169 but playing this game is sending out a message to the world we are a small country but we can show how big we are

6016188 theyre advice to us was unless youve got a 30 megalitre pool that you can drain every two hours unless youve 30 people who can jump on the whale and restrain it unless youve got some really sophisticated facilities you cant do it where you are
6016189 i guess its fair to say that were getting close to that position at the moment were not there at this stage and were really really hopeful that there can be some other possible way through
6016190 its a really tough market out there and business plans which rely on major capital investments and large staff increases simply dont add up
6016191 with genetic engineering its a matter of adding more storage and a max assist station alongside my eq and i have the ability to work on two projects or different aspects of the same project simultaneously
6016192 i can be conforming or playing out one episode or a reel from a film while simultaneously grading another
6016193 i estimate that this has enabled me to do 40 more work per day
6016194 and to take on the kind of longform projects that i simply couldnt have considered before for risk of impacting on my commercials work
6016195 we were down about ten percent but we made up for that with forty percent up for the month of july so it worked out very well
6016196 i have over 20 thousand dollars in trees and shrubs and if somebody forgets to water it or its not watered properly its lost
6016197 it started out good but the rain kind of stopped so most of the vegetables started to die
6016198 it is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers
6016199 such striking differences in behaviour between liars and truth tellers are rarely seen in deception research
6016200 liars must need to make up their stories and must monitor their fabrication so that they are plausible and adhere to everything the observer knows or might find out
6016201 in addition liars must remember their earlier statements so that they appear consistent when re telling their story and know what they told to whom liars will be more inclined than truth tellers to monitor and control their demeanour so they will appear honest
6016202 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6016203 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6016204 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6016205 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
6016206 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
6016207 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6016208 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
6016209 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
6016210 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear

6016212 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
6016213 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
6016214 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
6016215 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities
6016216 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6016217 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6016222 this is the shocking true story about the reality behind abortion and the heroic struggle of a mother willing to do anything to save her child
6016223 even though the movie doesnt take any side the way i show it i show both sides of the spectrum on the issue of abortion
6016224 i just let the spectator decide which side hes going to take from the story because its based on a true story
6016225 about a woman who decides to get an abortion and she gets an abortion but its also the story of a woman who after she gets the abortion realizes what she has done when she has that mother son connection
6016226 we want to do private screenings for our target audience then branch out from there so viewers can recommend the movie to more people
6016227 were doing it that way because we dont have the money to distribute it nationwide yet but we do have access to viral marketing so we can get our main niche to follow the movie and recommend it and create enough noise to get media attention eventually wed like it to go all over the country
6016228 i know a lot of people who support the pro life movement would like to see this film excel
6016229 the main ways to do that are to help us make connections with media help us find places to do screenings and help us financially make those screenings happen
6016230 if we found a spot do a private screening im more than willing to try to make it happen right now our connections are in those cities where we have screenings planned but for example i dont know people in say chicago
6016231 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6016232 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6016233 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6016234 well you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6016235 for a minute there there were just two christians worshipping together ill never forget that moment
6016236 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest i believe that americas best days are ahead of us but i also believe that we face enormous challenges both national security and domestic
6016237 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6016238 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6016239 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6016240 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6016241 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6016242 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6016243 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
6016244 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6016245 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
6016246 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6016247 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6016248 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6016249 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
6016250 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
6016251 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6016252 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
6016253 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6016254 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
6016255 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
6016256 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
6016257 you cant be upset with two medals at my first olympics
6016258 dat is een zeer complex proces we voeren daarom s nachts veel vaker werkzaamheden uit en dat maakt ons netwerk op dit moment wat kwetsbaarder

6016261 hey ich habe hier noch ein kleines projekt mit danger mouse am laufen aber danach habe ich auf jeden fall zeit und dann k nnen wir das album zusammen machen
6016262 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6016263 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6016264 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6016265 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6016266 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6016267 the significant military assistance provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future and probably in the near future ties between russia and israel and russias attitude toward arab states
6016268 russia will re examine its ties with israel and it is not unlikely that moscow will now decide to increase its military assistance to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria

6016291 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

6016367 why should we take those cornballs at wal mart seriously money and ownership alone arent enough set high goals encourage competition and then keep score nothing else can quite substitute for a few well chosen well timed sincere words of praise theyre absolutely free and worth a fortune were all working together thats the secret the folks on the front lines the ones who actually talk to the customer are the only ones who really know whats going on out there the two most important words i ever wrote were on that first wal mart sign satisfaction guaranteed theyre still up there and they have made all the difference each wal mart store should reflect the values of its customers and support the vision they hold for their community there is only one boss the customer and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down simply by spending his money somewhere else

6016442 the poor are the chosen children of the lord we are called to be instruments of his mercy and protection in their favour we must try to become fitting instruments

6016469 il motivo semplice abbiamo elaborato un progetto condiviso tra me quale cappellano delle suore della stella maris di mondragone ce e la superiore e la comunit religiosa e soprattutto con i villeggianti che frequentano il centro estivo di ascolto nonch oratorio pubblico sia nelle giornate feriali che soprattutto festive per dare un senso pi autenticamente religioso alla vacanza senza privarla del naturale clima di distensione e di divertimento
6016470 dal fatto che il convento delle suore a pochi metri dal mare e quindi era possibile organizzarsi soprattutto nelle serate quando il tempo era buono sulla spiaggia ove le suore hanno gi predisposto le strutture per accogliere i villeggianti ci sono gazebo e cabine come dire le strutture minime per organizzare la recita del rosario ma anche altri momenti di preghiera sulla spiaggia a contatto con la natura e con il creato per chi ha vissuto questi momenti tra cui diversi giovani stato per loro e per tutti una bellissima esperienza di fede ma anche di socializzazione
6016471 la partecipazione a mio modesto avviso stato ottima in quanto non facile n semplice coinvolgere sistematicamente alcune centinaia di persone per iniziative di carattere religioso soprattutto in quei luoghi ove sei pi esposto e visibile come la spiaggia per manifestare la tua fede e il tuo credo destate difficilmente la gente va in chiesa e prega il modulo convento spiaggia sano divertimento pu essere una nuova formula per interessare i credenti e non di tutte le et allestate nella struttura delle suore infatti non si solo pregato o si andato in spiaggia per il sole o per il bagno salutare e rinfrescante ma si sono avuti momenti di animazione di cultura di giochi soprattutto quando stata prevalente la componente giovanile
6016472 assolutamente no rientra nei nostri doveri di sacerdoti e pastori di animare in modo degno e rapportato alle situazioni locali il popolo di dio e il gregge che il signore ci affida anche per un breve periodo come sono i turisti e i villeggianti con laiuto delle suore che sono state co protagoniste delliniziativa mi sembra che lesperimento sia andato bene certo non nascondo una personale soddisfazione che anche la stampa locale nazionale e mondiale abbia prestato attenzione a questa semplice iniziativa forse per alcuni banale ma che in s porta un messaggio nuovo per lestate a qualsiasi livello e in qualsiasi luogo quello della coniugabilit della preghiera con il sano divertimento con il riposo con un rigenerante bagno nelle acque del nostro splendido mare e con la tintarella e labbronzatura a cui aspirano un po tutti comprese le suore i preti e i monaci
6016473 mi hanno insegnato che le cose che vanno non si toccano finquando possibile portarle avanti in modo degno ed efficace la formula estiva convento spiaggia sano divertimento proponibile sempre e dovunque soprattutto quando ci sono le strutture a disposizione la buona volont delle persone la disponibilit della clientela e un p di creativit in chi chiamato a proporre e mai imporre le cose dopo lesperienza positiva di questanno dintesa con le suore sicuramente ripeteremo il tutto il prossimo anno migliorando le cose che non sono andate bene e contando su una maggiore collaborazione dei fedeli laici degli operatori turistici e gestori dei lidi iniziative del genere richiamano turisti e villeggianti perch vengono assicurati non solo spiaggia divertimento ma anche assistenza spirituale e molte persone compreso i giovani desiderano anche questo nonostante tutto

6016479 its always been this guy ahead of me that guy ahead of me and ive always had to rise above that to show what i could do
6016480 the biggest plus for me now is i dont have that fear looking over my back seeing how many guys are there worrying about being out on the next cut my first couple years i worried about that now i can focus more on getting better rather than trying to impress every play not try to do too much just do what im supposed to do

6016515 life is the life of the child waiting to be born and of the born
6016516 i believe the noblest words ever written are that all of us are created equal and endowed by our creator by certain unalienable rights among these are life life is the life of the child waiting to be born and of the born thats what human rights are about
6016517 we shouldnt tell other people what to do with their bodies

6016521 i really believe its a person who shared our values our principles and our priorities its a tough decision we have men and women in our party and in the country we have men and women who i think are highly qualified and its a tough decision and i wish i didnt have to make it to tell the truth but its part of the requirements to get the best qualified person

6016536 students all over the diocese get their back packs together some put on uniforms and everyone begins getting up a bit earlier and ready for school the new year begins and our catholic schools remain a big part of it for many generations and for thousands of students
6016537 measurable outcomes or even helping students learn essential facts and marketable skills that prepare them for employment
6016538 about the formation of men and women in all aspects of life and living each student must be what god intends him or her to be they must be helped toward their eternal salvation
6016539 lead to the development of men and women who live virtue understand better the mystery and meaning of life and who will be set on a path which acknowledges the mystery of the cross and has heaven as its ultimate goal
6016540 an authentic vision of what a person is and what his or her eternal destiny entails
6016541 rather we are made for life long faithful commitments that appropriately express our gender our vocation and utilize our talents generously
6016542 in our schools we pray we need to pray prayer is a response to our sense of gods presence with us always our readiness to be intercessors for one another and the realization that we are persons constantly in need of gods light and grace god is first and when we put him first all the other good things find their proper place we worship him in the community of the church and the holy sacrifice of the mass is the font and highest expression of our life
6016543 i pray that in our schools from early childhood to university we will be forming saints through obedience to the holy spirit and his light entrusted to the apostles may our students begin to be more like jesus christ to the glory of the heavenly father

6016545 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6016546 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
6016547 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me
6016548 and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6016549 i am a complete foodie luckily i am blessed with good genes

6016554 i find attractive the arguments of scholars such as stephen macedo who defend an activist supreme court that would
6016555 that caught me off guard and i had no recollection of making so atypical a statement which shook me up even more
6016556 now it would seem to me what you were talking about
6016557 is you find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of property rights because you know that is what they write about
6016558 it has been quite some time since i have read professor macedo but i dont believe that in my writings i have indicated that we should have an activist supreme court or that we should have any form of activism on the supreme court
6016559 but the libertarian argument overlooks the place of the supreme court in a scheme of separation of powers one does not strengthen self government and the rule of law by having the non democratic branch of the government make policy
6016560 it doesnt matter to me whether im confirmed or not but i entered this process with a good name and i want to have it at the end

6016579 for the liberal party to try and blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6016580 now we havent heard back and i think the prime ministers department is yet to wake up to the powers of the senate
6016581 it would be better for the government to have responded long ago to the greens request and to have come up with a proposal
6016582 its 12 years since labor was in office and many of the ministers are not practised with making informative approaches to the senate
6016583 but we do have a mandate of our own as well
6016584 were certainly more inclined to support them if the government can provide guarantees around the public health system but having said that we havent seen those guarantees yet
6016585 paul francis gadd will be deported to his home country england unconditionally and as soon as possible
6016586 he poses a danger to a peaceful and orderly society and offends thai morals
6016587 he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
6016588 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6016589 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6016590 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
6016591 we are coming here to submit a letter to the british government asking them to return thaksin to receive justice in thailand
6016592 thaksin fled the indictment to london and is planning to seek asylum in britain
6016593 if thaksin is not brought back to face the charges against him in thai courts it will further contribute to the political and democratic deadlock
6016594 extradition requests are decided in strict accordance with the law
6016595 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant

6016602 zomerprogrammas als tien om te zien en vtm live cre ren extra aandacht voor het nederlandstalige genre
6016603 de verkoop van dat repertoire is al verscheidene jaren aan het stijgen
6016604 een en ander bewijst wel dat dergelijke acties werken op voorwaarde dat ze goed zijn uitgekiend zon bon is doorgaans anderhalve week geldig waardoor de verkoop vooral in de eerste twee weken piekt toch blijft het effect ook daarna nog nawerken vaak houdt zon single tien weken of langer stand en wordt daardoor ook de verkoop van de van die artiesten aangezwengeld dat soort acties beperkt zich trouwens niet tot vlaamse zangers de jongste single van soulsister die aanvankelijk nauwelijks op de radio kwam werd bijvoorbeeld een hit dankzij een soortgelijke campagne
6016605 het is wel opvallend dat de verkoop van artiesten als bart ka ll en christoff juist tijdens de zomermaanden een hoogtepunt bereikt
6016606 sinds de fusie van ars waar busschots het metier leerde ds en universal zijn wij zowat de enigen die zich op die markt begeven we beschikten al over een zekere knowhow over hoe we die artiesten het best aan de man konden brengen en die hebben we nu ge mplementeerd in een groter bedrijf met een grotere promotiemachine voor universal is het binnenlandse repertoire sowieso een prioriteit dat geldt voor deus of eva de roovere maar ook voor christoff en lindsay het is een terrein waarop volgens mij nog heel wat groei mogelijk is
6016607 al die artiesten hadden ook net een langspeler uit en voor ieder van hen hebben we een promo en marketingbudget het komt eropaan het aan te wenden op een manier die het publiek nog weet te prikkelen een bon in een krant of weekblad geeft een goede kickstart helpt een vibe te cre ren waar de cd verkoop van meeprofiteert waar ik het echter nog altijd moeilijk mee heb is dat de meeste radiostations het vlaamse repertoire negeren of banaliseren en het iedere credibiliteit pogen te ontnemen in het huidige klimaat kun je zelfs geen groep als clouseau of de kreuners lanceren gewoon omdat er geen platform meer voor bestaat en dat terwijl er toch een ruim publiek voor is
6016608 de doelgroep koopt wat er in het genre voor handen is de duettenplaat van laura lynn en franz bauer heeft al 40 000 stuks verkocht de cd van christoff zit momenteel aan 15 000 zeg nu zelf dat zijn toch geen marginale cijfers

6016635 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
6016636 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
6016637 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message

6016639 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6016640 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6016641 it was a severe fire and completely destroyed the inside of the building
6016642 it is quite a shock it has only been open for a few months
6016643 i cant get down the street because its all taped off but you can tell its a really bad fire just by looking at the outside of the building it really smells of smoke too
6016644 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
6016645 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for

6016649 nagori along with his brother karimuddin were the key trainers during the simi training camp held in kerala december 2007 and halol in gujarat january 2008
6016650 they are also key conspirators who designed and planned the terror attacks in ahmedabad they may also be involved in jaipur and hyderabad blasts
6016651 we are presently concentrating on interrogation of those arrested by us later we will bring nagori in for further interrogation we believe he was instrumental in planning the blasts in ahmedabad he may have also arranged for funds to procure explosives and other materials

6016655 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6016656 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6016657 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
6016658 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
6016659 from 6 million now we see around 60 million subscribers by 2015 in the next 12 months alone the dth platform will add around 12 to 13 million subscribers
6016660 the home entertainment service market in spite of serving close to 120 million tv households for decades has still not delivered the quality choice and service experience leading to customer delight
6016661 big tv dth would be the first and only home entertainment service to deliver fully digital picture and sound choice of channels for every family member and highest levels of customer service across the country
6016662 we will also be offering several innovative and unique features in our services over the next few months other players offer their services using the mpeg2 platform but we will do so on the advanced mpeg4 platform we will be adding some more transponders in the next few months and can offer up to 300 350 channels by the first quarter next year we will also offer 8 10 hd high definition channels by the year end
6016663 we have decided to get the biggest tv stars to endorse our campaign and have already bought 15 000 spots on television for the next three weeks

6016666 welcome mr president you are a great friend of afghanistan a man of great principles
6016667 this detachment was involved in a big ambush by a group of about 100 insurgents the combat was fierce and intense fighting and lasted several hours continuing late into the night
6016668 as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
6016669 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
6016670 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
6016671 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
6016672 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
6016673 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
6016674 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
6016675 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
6016676 i wouldnt be able to tell you what would be in the minds of the icc board when it sits to consider such an eventuality it would be great for the best teams to attend and every one of the best players to come
6016677 i think weve got to a position where its very difficult to do it to the position where we could stage a successful world class event
6016678 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move it is speculative until member boards or teams clearly indicate what their view is as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
6016679 every single day our security advisors update themselves and in turn us on the changing political environment in pakistan
6016680 the advice on the current development is that the status quo remains unchanged if anything it is a step in the right direction and im quoting their words
6016681 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation has the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard
6016682 meanwhile relevant cooperation should be conducive to the integrity and effectiveness of maintaining the international non proliferation regime
6016683 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6016684 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6016685 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
6016686 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
6016687 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
6016688 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6016689 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
6016690 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
6016691 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
6016692 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
6016693 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
6016694 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6016695 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6016696 besides party mlas some independents too might accompany soren who will reach the national capital today evening
6016697 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6016698 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6016699 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6016700 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6016701 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaida
6016702 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6016703 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6016704 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6016705 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6016706 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6016707 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6016708 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6016709 we stand ready to offer humanitarian assistance to the government of pakistan if requested in regards to the situation in the tribal regions
6016710 always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6016711 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6016712 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6016713 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6016714 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6016715 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6016716 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6016717 theres no question this is an insider versus outsider campaign
6016718 im not surprised by those who are opposing us they want to control our legislature
6016719 council has a hidden agenda of complicating and junking up anson street so they can proceed with shutting the street down to create an outdoor mall they have given no thought at all before going ahead with a slapdash approach
6016720 thats not planning where is the consideration for the elderly and the disabled because if anything this ridiculous crossing makes things 10 times harder for pedestrians our taxi drivers and all the other drivers who use the street each day
6016721 i cant think of anywhere else that i have travelled where there is such a potpourri of things working against each other what has been done over the years has been a series of attempts to make the street safer which has in fact exacerbated the problem
6016722 this latest attempt the crossing is not even working properly at the quietest time of the quietest day of the week
6016723 its so helpful it was definitely good to have someone at home i could speak to in french instead of just speaking to myself
6016724 it has been good they my fellow students are crazy
6016725 at the end of the course they are meant to be able to carry on a conversation and they can all do that now
6016726 i think its a really important event and it helps to showcase the city
6016727 the awards are not all about cleaning up paper there are a lot more issues to consider such as recycling
6016728 take pride in the fact that they live in orange
6016729 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6016730 the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6016731 in the unlikely event a major bank became insolvent the government would ensure that the fscs has access to enough immediate funding to pay out depositors in a timely manner through borrowing from the government or bank of england the fscs could then levy up to 4 billion per year from the financial services industry to cover the costs of compensation
6016732 i have spoken with the returning officer kay reid and she has some concerns that if there is no election there is a feeling in the molong community that they dont have to vote
6016733 that isnt true they will still need to vote in the referendum
6016734 its a steady stream of people coming to me saying its good we dont have to vote
6016735 i say to them yes it is good but we still vote in the referendum they say what referendum
6016736 i learned for about 10 years and loved it the girls saw the wiggles and just wanted to learn how to dance
6016737 we are very excited to finally have our plans in to council
6016738 this represents the culmination of many months of painstaking work by our school council and consultants to ensure the best possible design for our school now and into the future
6016739 we want to ensure that the site is energy efficient and environmentally sustainable
6016740 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6016741 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6016742 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6016743 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
6016744 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6016745 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6016746 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6016747 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6016748 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6016749 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6016750 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6016751 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6016752 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6016753 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6016754 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6016755 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6016756 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6016757 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
6016758 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
6016759 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
6016760 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
6016761 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
6016762 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
6016763 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
6016764 officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the airport transit area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre
6016765 he is banned from entering thailand because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
6016766 we were last aware that he remained in transit he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6016767 i have no doubt that we must be here i am also in shock but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again
6016768 not the patrol and the sequence of events but the choice which led me to confirm the decision of my predecessors to send the french army here
6016769 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6016770 today western leaders must ask themselves why their policies have failed
6016771 without urgent troop redeployment attacks in and around kabul are likely to be stepped up with the taliban on the very doorstep of the afghan capital the situation can only get worse for nato isaf forces and for the afghan people
6016772 what are the aims of this war how many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives

6016778 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6016779 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6016780 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6016781 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned russian president dmitry medvedev said last month as the missile talks moved to a close

6016787 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
6016788 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
6016789 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
6016790 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
6016791 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
6016792 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
6016793 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
6016794 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
6016795 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
6016796 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do

6016834 a few years ago we were in financial crisis we changed the organisation around so it would be able to withstand difficult markets we have been streamlining our organisation to deal with a difficult market

6016839 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
6016840 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
6016841 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
6016842 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
6016843 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
6016844 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
6016845 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
6016846 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
6016847 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
6016848 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town
6016849 commercial development should include the highest density high impact uses at the major node intersections while lower density low impact uses should be located at the minor nodes and town core areas
6016850 due to its physical constraints it is unlikely that study areas would support large scale industrial or retail development
6016851 please be advised that this property is in fact not located at an intersection

6016868 het slaapwandelen geschiedt meestal in een halfbewuste toestand waarin men zich wel bewust is van het eigen lichaam maar de omgeving waarin men is gedeeltelijk droomt of via een droombewustzijn waarneemt meestal zijn de ogen van de slaapwandelaar tijdens zijn nachtelijke escapades gewoon open ook praten zomaar of in reactie op anderen is niet ongewoon hoewel het gesprokene over het algemeen niet coherent is
6016869 it makes objects out of women it degrades them and were sick of people like steve crow trampling over the values of our country
6016870 some rougher guitars and abrupt time changes that mightve been jarring on the album its not bad at all for an outtake
6016871 its the guitar line that marks your brain colours your day sends you humming a scale to yourself while you wait in line at the fruit stand
6016872 it plays out like the theme to an all too short ethereal dream sequence
6016873 is this what dubstep did to brian wilson and the beach boys legacy dragged the summer out so that it lasts seven seasons all the plants will die lofi pop from that seventh season
6016874 holy after about 2 sets my arms felt like they were going to explode i taken tons of supplements in the past year and this is not a placebo affect trust me when you cant fully extend your arms because they are so pumped after only 4 sets of curls there is nothing psychological about that after over a year of trying i have also been able to finally shed that fat around my lower back testoripped rocks
6016875 testoripped is the shizznit i am having more intense cardio and workouts then i have ever had i am currently on my second bottle of testoripped my muscles feel rock hard and i am getting more intense pumps i have also lost over 12 pounds dont be fooled by get testoripped you wont be disappointed
6016876 i didnt think it would be normal to feel an instant impact when taking testoripped but i was way wrong i am skeptical by nature which eliminates my chances of having any sort of placebo effect i can honestly say thanks to testoripped i have lost over 20 pounds in the past 8 weeks with testoripped it has changed the way i look and how i feel about myself thanks
6016877 size definition and energy incredible everything i am looking for in a pre workout supplement is found in testoripped i was surprised that it contained the best of the best ingredients and that it was so affordable i have shed some serious fat around my stomach no more tire around my waist i am also noticing some terrific muscle gains
6016878 so after a month i can say using the testoripped has totally changed my body and the way i work out
6016879 e tutto previsto replica gasparri e tutto programmato quindi non ce alcun problema ce un testo che e stato redatto a luglio e che ovviamente come tutti i testi dovra essere emendato e migliorato ma i tempi sono quelli previsti si tratta di un provvedimento collegato alla finanziaria perche e di natura fiscale ed economica e quindi entro lanno sara approvato

6016917 the first call was received on friday afternoon telling my mother that she won r50 000 in mtn top talks competition so my mother was supposed to send her details including banking information when she asked for confirmation of the competition from the police the fraudster said everything was ok and never called back
6016918 the most harmful aspect of this situation is the perceptions about mtn that may be created by the media and the public
6016919 they have exposed a very limited set of capabilities that this architecture is capable of

6016925 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6016926 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6016927 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6016928 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned russian president dmitry medvedev said last month as the missile talks moved to a close

6016931 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
6016932 the crews are assigned the task not to allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
6016933 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
6016934 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
6016935 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
6016936 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6016937 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
6016938 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
6016939 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there

6016948 the architecture foundation under its new director sarah ichioka will inevitably be changing its shape to accommodate what it perceives as the changing needs of this challenging period the board of trustees are thrilled at the prospect of working with sarah and are confident of an exciting future bringing our passion for the best in contemporary architecture to an ever wider audience we will need the support and help of the profession students and a wider public to provide the service we are here for
6016949 i am absolutely delighted to be given the opportunity to lead the architecture foundation into its next stage i look forward to building a focussed pertinent programme for the foundation developed in close collaboration with its trustees staff and patrons and inspired by its history as an independent advocate for innovation and emerging talent in contemporary architecture and urbanism

6016955 for the first time in my life i was nervous before a game
6016956 if phil starts playing like that when he gets nervous then i hope it happens a whole lot more often
6016957 he was awesome out there and there wasnt a lot they could do against him

6016963 i am saddened by liu xiangs exit i think it is because of the intense training if he had been more relaxed the injury might not have been so bad
6016964 i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation

6017006 uns geht es um die von beiden institutionen erfolgreich gelehrte innovationsmethode des design thinking durch gemeinsame wissenschaftliche forschungsprojekte wollen wir herausfinden welche faktoren diese art des ingenieurartigen und kreativen entwickelns von innovationen f r alle lebensbereiche letztlich so erfolgreich machen
6017007 ingenieure sind stets bestrebt die grundlegenden ergebnisse wissenschaftlicher forschung so anzuwenden wie es den bed rfnissen der menschen entspricht wenn wir diesen innovationsprozess k nftig besser verstehen hilft uns das der gesellschaft in k rzerer zeit bessere l sungen bereitzustellen
6017008 zusammen mit der stanford university werden wir auch untersuchen wie solche von kleinen multidisziplin ren teams hervorgebrachten innovationsprozesse k nftig weiter verbessert werden k nnten
6017009 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
6017010 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
6017011 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
6017012 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
6017013 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else
6017014 but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
6017015 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
6017016 her confidence kind of filters down to everybody on this team and allows us to play without any fear
6017017 thats one of the most important things if we feel free out there and able to express ourselves thats going to bring the best out of every individual and obviously the best out of us collectively
6017018 we started off to talk about change and they have embraced the change
6017019 its all about the journey so whatever is happening no one can take away the journey weve had
6017020 i think we needed that outside source to come in and shake things up a little bit and give us new opinions and a new mindframe about everything
6017021 there was no time to dwell on the past she came in with this aura of confidence like you know what she said what she was going to say move on get over it were moving forward either you want to win or you dont want to win
6017022 of course she was very genuine and knew people were hurt but we had no time to dwell on it
6017023 enjoy every one of those 90 minutes out on the field

6017030 religious and political affiliation does not impact whether an individual is placed
6017031 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6017032 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
6017033 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
6017034 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6017035 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6017036 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6017037 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6017038 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6017039 this kind of information is useful in confirming the epidemiology of the virus determining when it arrived in certain areas and how it spreads

6017042 in maine traditional methods of restoring atlantic salmon by stocking fish have not been very successful with only 0 68 per cent returning
6017043 with the tagged salmon we can track more fish further into the ocean than ever before and get meaningful results
6017044 were not sure where they go in between but were hoping to find that out
6017045 the salmon crossing the line is evidence that the network is working
6017046 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
6017047 broad scale ocean arrays such as the otn halifax line are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment

6017054 well couldnt one just i dont know not check their email
6017055 the ventilation system up there is working i want an update
6017056 my head feels like someone is hitting it with a hammer
6017057 yours looks like someone hit it with a hammer do you think this is over
6017058 if that sob touched our baby i will kill him with my bare hands
6017059 the last time i examined him he was in a paralytic coma i tested myself
6017060 but did you think to have a doctor test him this is too coincidental to be random stefano has to be behind this when we catch him he will wish he had never awakened from that coma
6017061 omg then theyre going to go after lucas for trying to kill ej
6017062 i knew something was going on between ej and sami lucas is so much better off without her
6017063 it was because of the gas in here it was because we were trapped here what happened happened i know what i said and meant it i couldnt imagine my life without you ej
6017064 i am not the one who is going to hurt you
6017065 if your father is behind this he will go after lucas
6017066 i dont think its wise for you to insult me
6017067 im not going to punish you for shooting elvis you got off pretty easily for attempted murder i just think its a good idea you are moving on with the lovely miss lane and samantha realizes her place is by elvis side they will be the future of my family
6017068 she injected stefano with the same toxin she has been injected with
6017069 lucas or ej ej or lucas ej and i have a son lucas and i have a daughter i just dont know
6017070 the only time sami is honest is when it benefits sami things will never change with her
6017071 i can concentrate on my future now my daughter and my son
6017072 i could be a part of that future if you play your cards right
6017073 i cant bear to see him being blinded by that
6017074 if there is any way you can get him from sami go for it
6017075 oh its so good to see you i didnt know you were here
6017076 i dont know whats worse being trapped with stefano or stuck in a stairwell with sami
6017077 your open shirt the clinging kissing that visual is buried deep in my brain
6017078 if its in your brain it cant be too deep
6017079 then we escaped to the stairwell and were breathing fresh air
6017080 he might be all right we dont know whats going on
6017081 i was able to get away there are others ive been told who werent as lucky
6017082 i hope the gas will have no long lasting affects oh yes dr marlena evans i want her to be arrested for assault and attempted murder she did it to me if you do not see her brought to justice i will punish her myself
6017083 we dont know how sami and ej got in the stairwell

6017109 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
6017110 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed
6017111 if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in postiion for things like this to happen
6017112 they made different promises saying they would take care of me
6017113 it all goes back to last year even before camp
6017114 i have no anger to the chap involved i just feel numb towards him
6017115 he is young and made a stupid mistake i dont bear him any malice or have anger towards him
6017116 that might change though if in six months im told the damage is permanent although at the moment im getting stronger each day and trying to stay on the positive side
6017117 he seems genuinely remorseful which i was told on several occasions by police officers who interviewed him
6017118 judges really ought to be freed up to take it case by case
6017119 there seems to be a broad scope of dangerous driving offences and the maximum two year sentence doesnt seem a lot for some cases

6017122 when you can handle the blitz the game becomes fun at quarterback he said
6017123 once you realize the blitz in an opportunity for a big play instead of an opportunity for disaster the game becomes fun
6017124 he can beat you with his legs he can beat you with his arm and now what he is learning to do is to beat you with his mind
6017125 everybody makes it a two horse race i think its a three horse race
6017126 well do our best to get there when the season ends
6017127 it should be motivation i dont think the players will like it but it doesnt mean a darn thing right now
6017128 you see the shake and bake and you see the effort he is really trying to be that leader you want him to be in a group of great talent
6017129 i think if im here two weeks from now theyre going to release me
6017130 other than that if i get traded before then then i get traded
6017131 but if it comes down to the last cut and im still here theyre going to release me i dont think theres any doubt about that
6017132 you kind of want to keep things safe every now and then too i couldnt really see the defensive back
6017133 i wanted to keep it low and away in case the d b was going to try to undercut him either my guy was going to catch it or nobody was going to catch it
6017134 for the most part i thought i did ok there were a few things here and there that i would have done differently
6017135 im not one to read the newspaper and i dont even look at the internet
6017136 i just try to go by what people tell me
6017137 im just trying to get myself back to where i want to be and get to being a quarterback again
6017138 being around the guys again thats enough to keep me motivated im sure there are people who dont think i can come back from my injury

6017176 its going fantastically glasgow is a great place to have it because all the delegates actually come to the meetings because of the weather and we appreciate that
6017177 its wonderful the city can host us and the local people who have helped arrange it have been fantastic
6017178 i havent seen the city much yet but it looks peaceful and its warm today which i am happy about i am having difficulty with the accent but i feel very comfortable and the people are friendly
6017179 glasgow is an interesting place we want to go visit the university and we went to the west end last night and it was very cute
6017180 i like glasgow the public transport is easy to use and its a good place for conferences like this but i did have trouble getting a hotel room and had to stay a long way out at stepps
6017181 the conference is great and when i have time i want to visit kelvingrove museum which i have heard about
6017182 we are staying at the carlton george hotel which is good it wasnt the nicest walk along the river to here that area could do with some improvement
6017183 what a match our bowling and fielding always keeps us in the hunt if only we had another 2 consistent batsmen other than sanga mahela and sanath to replace
6017184 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice

6017186 with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to off shore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
6017187 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6017188 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6017189 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6017190 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6017191 i think my consultants would love to find somebody other than me
6017192 because i get into situations where maybe im doing a governors race and a congressional race in the same market

6017196 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
6017197 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of
6017198 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours

6017212 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
6017213 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
6017214 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
6017215 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
6017216 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
6017217 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
6017218 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically

6017242 it is a competition after all and the best athlete wins i actually worked as hard as anybody else
6017243 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied
6017244 hopefully ill be back for 2012 london olympics where ill be hoping for a top five finish
6017245 i want to compliment her on being so strong and so brave
6017246 i was in a good position during the first lap but it didnt feel right i never found that comfortable spot that place my little bubble that i could just hold
6017247 i just never got to the position that i wanted to be in i tried my very best
6017248 im just annoyed because i didnt get to savor looking up and coming in third because of that negative its unsportsmanship i would never pull on someones legs so i would never assume someone would do it to me but at the end of the day ive got one of these medals and she hasnt so thats enough
6017249 i dont want to say anymore because i dont want to start an inter country war
6017250 it was really crowded going around the corners there was a lot of grabbing and pulling but i have to say i was no angel either
6017251 it was a pretty physical race i tried to stay away from a lot of it
6017252 if i wouldve tried to get into a good draft position i wouldve just gotten beat up i was sprinting so long that when people started to speed up i just started to slow down
6017253 i had to clash on numerous occasions especially with the swimmers from brazil
6017254 i was trying to break away from the brazilian girls who were quite aggressive this is swimming after all not boxing
6017255 i just gave my all and tried to get through the match
6017256 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6017257 i wanted to make china proud in the olympics that china is hosting
6017258 in the first leg i felt the gold was already in my pocket because i was first and the chinese girl was behind
6017259 in the end i turned around on the last leg and realized that maybe spain had given up
6017260 i knew if i kept passing one after another victory would be mine

6017263 apart from several glitches which happily escape the memory right now we have eclipsed britain in sports for decades britain has been crumbling since george orwell started writing about it in the 1930s and warnie wasnt even born then isnt it almost mean not to applaud britains riches at these games after all if cornered in a bar debate theres always the average number of teeth argument failing that explain that britain gave us sovereignty that we then gave britain rolf harris and that that seems like a pretty good deal
6017264 british athletes for now are not bums but heroes much like olympic gold medal sprinter linford christie once was until he got busted for drugs and it was pointed out that like most british sporting stars he was born somewhere that wasnt britain
6017265 paul francis gadd will be deported to his home country england unconditionally and as soon as possible
6017266 he poses a danger to a peaceful and orderly society and offends thai morals
6017267 he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
6017268 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6017269 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6017270 we dont feel its appropriate he spends his time hopping from one country to the next one while countries decide what to do with him
6017271 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
6017272 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
6017273 lets forget all that stuff lets concentrate on qualifying for the world cup in two years time it is in the hands of the players to do that
6017274 weve got the manager and the players to move forward but lets not focus on winning anything we just need to qualify for this world cup and have to concentrate on that
6017275 in the short of space of time weve had with the manager he has stressed about having less anxiety and more confidence and weve done that

6017293 i dont think anyone before has made excuses it just hasnt been good enough its as simple as that as players you take responsibility as individuals you take responsibility and as a team you have to do that
6017294 of course its always good to have experienced players here because when times arent good it is always good to help the young lads who are maybe not doing as well
6017295 we have got a chance it is a tough group theres no question but we have as much of a chance as everyone else
6017296 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6017297 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6017298 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate

6017333 a few laps after the start the car became very difficult to drive and my feeling was that the pressure of the tyres was too high
6017334 after the first pit stop i realised that the massive lack of grip was still there and in those circumstances you simply have to slow down since the grip and the traction become very poor
6017335 fourth position on the starting grid shows that the car was not so bad for that track and track conditions were similar on saturday and sunday so as i said i would point my finger in the direction of the tyre issue there were also some technical problems that may have influenced performance although in a limited way

6017341 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6017342 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6017343 kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew him and loved him

6017372 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6017373 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
6017374 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6017375 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6017376 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
6017377 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6017378 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
6017379 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6017380 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6017381 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6017382 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6017383 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6017384 these special forces work with the americans they are not associated with the ministry of defense

6017410 president mwanawasa was a true servant of the people who served this country with dignity and honor
6017411 he observed the rule of law and he gallantly fought graft in all its forms we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6017412 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6017413 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6017414 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6017415 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition
6017416 i have not suggested it because i believe he genuinely wants to serve americas national interests now it is time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6017417 even in retrospect he would choose the path of failure for america over the path of success and victory
6017418 in short both candidates in this election have pledged to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
6017419 the reason why conventions still matter is because millions of voters are distracted they are busy

6017427 its interesting that this competitor chose to go to a major media outlet about this rather than drop a quiet note to the princeton review
6017428 clearly they were intending to get some commercial advantage out of this i think theres a message here for other companies its not just hackers that may find a security hole its competitors too
6017429 it sounds like the testing industry is a very competitive industry and thats why this happened there

6017437 were really excited about bringing yell com to tv in its first stand alone ad campaign yell com offers a quick and easy way for people across the uk to find all kinds of activities services businesses and shops and the creative brings this to life in a light hearted and energetic way
6017438 we wanted to create a campaign to show the core strength of yell com finding businesses and services by creating the characters of fresno and carrie party planners to the rich and famous we are able to engage and entertain a contemporary audience
6017439 the rise of the super rich within the uk is a recent trend that fascinates the nation we felt this would be an intriguing and fun world for yell com to exist within where the brand can really demonstrate the full range of its capabilities in entertaining clever and diverse ways
6017440 we lost three guys in iraq with big connections to rugby and their families turned round and said is there anything we could do
6017441 we also won the army cup in rugby last year and its an opportunity for us to get out raise awareness and raise money for our three charities the army benevolent fund the welsh charitable trust and help for heroes
6017442 we then hope to finish the challenge by scoring a converted try before the wales v south africa game at the millennium stadium in cardiff in november and then lay a wreath in honour of sir tasker watkins who had been a member of the welch regiment
6017443 he was a lovely man and it would be nice to do it we will have honoured all the soldiers from the regiment across wales and then we could honour arguably the most famous one sir tasker and pay tribute to him on the hallowed turf
6017444 then we drove to every rugby club but i felt a bit lazy doing that so we thought why not cycle

6017448 muy identificado con el proyecto por lo tanto la nica situaci n viable ahora mismo es que contin e con nosotros y muy contentos de que as sea
6017449 el jugador de banda derecha que todo el mundo desea que sea porque es uno de los mejores medios derechos del mundo
6017450 hablar con fernando por si sigue adelante lo que se dijo
6017451 es complicado pedirle al jugador que tenga la cabeza donde la debe tener pasando lo que ha pasado pues en tres meses joaqu n ha estado dentro fuera dentro fuera
6017452 por ello el planteamiento futuro es que el jugador se quede en el valencia
6017453 es jugador del valencia y tiene contrato con el club
6017454 sin embargo se vino a valencia con un tope salarial y una ilusi n muy grande que sigue teniendo y esperemos que el cari o que la afici n le ha dado l se lo devuelva en el campo siendo qui n es
6017455 lo importante es sacar conclusiones ya que estos partidos no est n para ganarlos aunque siempre es mejor ganar que perder
6017456 el objetivo es evaluar rendimientos y estudiar y valorar quien esta mejor de cara al inicio del campeonato
6017457 por eso hemos trabajado b sicamente con joseba llorente guille franco y jozy altidore la situaci n me ha servido para ver m s a joseba dar minutos a guille y conocer a altidore al tener menos delanteros hemos variado nuestro funcionamiento y hemos probado otras cosas
6017458 tendr n ganas de seguir ganando y eso le viene bien al equipo
6017459 el m ximo respeto a todo lo conseguido ya no es hora de homenajes y s de comenzar una nueva etapa
6017460 es normal que est un poco acelerado es un s ntoma de que se tiene emoci n por empezar y eso es importante en cualquier ejercicio de la vida
6017461 he vivido situaciones dif ciles y de gran responsabilidad y en una selecci n puede que se acreciente pero es parecido no hay mayor responsabilidad en un club que una selecci n
6017462 es lo mejor para m y para el f tbol espa ol partimos de una base y lo que hace falta es que sepamos cuidar todo lo que se ha conseguido y si es posible potenciarlo
6017463 mirar para atr s era una obligaci n m a en el plano humano y profesional
6017464 en el plano humano les hice ver la uni n y la humildad que hab an tenido en la eurocopa quer amos que eso siguiera porque el futbolista debe ser humilde y que el t tulo de la eurocopa no le cambie
6017465 en el plano futbol stico tambi n hay que mirar para atr s para atr s porque lo conseguido es importante el camino est marcado por eso en lo sustancial la convocatoria para este partido difiere muy poco de la que fue campe n de europa
6017466 es mi idea individualizar las charlas y ayer lo hice con los centrocampistas y les dije que tambi n son hombres b sicos para el futuro como lo han sido hasta ahora
6017467 me lo imagino como una vuelta a la normalidad y a la actividad y que el pasado no nos llegue a confundir
6017468 se puede ir cambiando luego en funci n del rival y de los partidos pero una idea base ya la tenemos
6017469 lo nico que me importa es tener al menos un punto m s que el resto de los pilotos despu s de la ltima carrera en brasil mi nico objetivo es ganar el mundial todo lo dem s no tiene importancia

6017494 michael ballack picked up an injury to his left foot in the game on sunday
6017495 he will not train until friday after which another evaluation will be made
6017496 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 per cent at best
6017497 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
6017498 i am not going to set a timetable but i am close i am working on my fitness every day and while i have not joined in with the lads yet hopefully it will happen this week
6017499 i remembered that when john and rio were captain they played very well
6017500 it was not easy for me to choose the captain they are very good players
6017501 i think his big personality is the reason i have chosen john but also rio is very important for the team in his position as vice captain
6017502 i think the captain is very important because he is the driver of the team
6017503 for the national team it is a very important season
6017504 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
6017505 wenger is indeed a cunning fox who always says one thing and does the other
6017506 he wanted andrei but arsenal are the only top english club who do not pay large salaries
6017507 i am just happy playing my football but if anything like that comes about ill be delighted
6017508 ive got this season and two more years left im happy really happy with how things are going happy here at aston villa
6017509 i am just looking to build on the performances of last season during this one and im glad we got off to a good start at the weekend against manchester city
6017510 its what ive been working for ever since i joined this club so it was great to get out there
6017511 i hope to get more chances in the team so ill be sticking around for a bit
6017512 theres been lots of speculation every day and weve been linked with hundreds of players but i dont think well be signing all of them
6017513 weve made good progress over the last day or two and i hope we have some news over the next 48 hours
6017514 if players want to come and we can take them to another level fantastic but if they want to stay at the clubs theyre at good luck to them its not a major problem
6017515 im not really looking to let any players go but if an offer comes in for one or two of my players like every other manager ive got to balance the books
6017516 arsene has been looking for experienced cover for gael clichy and he knows all about mikael
6017517 the thing that impressed me the most over the past couple of days is micahs attitude which has been great
6017518 there has been speculation that when players drop down they wont be motivated to play for the under 21s but that has not been the case with micah at all
6017519 players have to be able to step up and step down they do it abroad and we have to get into that mentality of doing it here
6017520 that will serve micah in good stead he cant be in the wilderness of not being in the seniors and not be in the under 21s and be in between the two squads
6017521 this is what we are trying to build towards players coming to the under 21 side and seeing it as a pathway back to the senior squad
6017522 if they do well here and do well for their club as he has done then they will get their chance
6017523 yo vine aqu con esperanzas en la prueba de persecuci n individual la madison era una segunda oportunidad
6017524 tambi n me entren alg n d a con miguel alzamora
6017525 no hay vuelta atr s en mi despedida es una decisi n pensada consensuada con la familia es duro retirarse as pero ya est tomada la decisi n s que al principio mi cabeza va a sufrir pero hay que hacerlo
6017526 te las dan cuando tienes buenos resultados en los juegos as la retirada me supone renunciar a una buena cantidad de dinero
6017527 toni estaba en buen momento y preferimos la fuerza a la t cnica
6017528 cre amos que no est bamos entre los favoritos porque era la primera vez que corr amos juntos pero al parecer alguno nos ten a fichados
6017529 ah nos dejamos m s de un cartucho tuvimos que tapar muchos huecos
6017530 era la nica oportunidad que ten amos porque al sprint no somos buenos
6017531 los aficionados que han venido de espa a me dec an que hab a que superarlo que no pod a ser ya lo he hecho pero para mi eso no es m s que una an cdota lo importante es sumar medallas para espa a
6017532 espero que haya dejado una forma de correr que la gente aprenda desde que corro hay cosas en las pruebas de puntos y madison que la gente me copia ha habido una evoluci n del ciclismo eso s que lo he conseguido
6017533 lo que m s me ha gustado de estos d as cuando entrenaba en el vel dromo era el respeto que me han demostrado mis compa eros
6017534 yo me he cansado mucho la verdad ha habido un diez les han puesto uno a las rusas y otro a nosotras nos concedieron uno en roma hace diez meses y ahora es el segundo y otro en el sincro espa a
6017535 yo que creo que s la lucha estar entre jap n y china por el tercer puesto porque a las rusas les est n puntuando muy bien
6017536 a las rusas les toca el oro se lo merecen por su regularidad por su trabajo por todo nosotras hemos mejorado much simo pero siempre ellas han estado arriba y siempre hemos querido acercarnos a ellas es l gico que ellas se merezcan el oro
6017537 las rusas cada vez nos miran m s de cerca nos tienen miedo el primer d a ni nos miraban a la cara y ya nos saludan ahora que ya saben que son primeras
6017538 hay que nadar para conseguir la medalla y hay que hacerlo bien es muy real y muy posible pero hay que hacerlo todo apunta a que s pero no hay que asegurar nada
6017539 a la reina le ha gustado dice que hay mucha diferencia entre los malos y los buenos
6017540 no sab a que ven an y vendr n ma ana tambi n
6017541 a veces se te escapa alguna sonrisa que no toca pero yo creo que le dan m s importancia a la t cnica y a la sincronizaci n que a la expresi n
6017542 nos cuesta llegar al final porque hay siete apneas en total quiz s sea el ejercicio m s ca ero en ese aspecto porque hay muchos movimientos de piernas
6017543 lo suyo es peor as que m s te vale hacerlo bien
6017544 estamos mas contentas que ayer dicen que en principio ha salido mejor pero bueno hemos luchado eso es lo que contaba ha habido un 9 7 del juez chino que era de esperar as que no pasa nada
6017545 creo que hay problemas con el tema de las luces es demasiado innovador en un deporte muy conservador
6017546 siempre lo he he visto como algo grande y ayudan a la naturaleza y a la humanidad es lo que m s me pega
6017547 estoy estudiando sociolog a voy cambiando pero esta es la definitiva
6017548 me gustan dos cosas una el tener un equipo al lado el compa erismo que vivimos y otra esas emociones que hay cada d a extra as y diferentes que no sabes qu te tocar es lo que me gusta que no es mon tono
6017549 la cambiar a de deporte vemos otros deportes que son mas divertidos ente comillas como por ejemplo el waterpolo entre que tiene mucha recompensa y entrenan la mitad de horas pues son m s listos
6017550 el deporte te educa tanto f sica como mentalmente y sobre todo el deporte de equipo porque te hace m s persona
6017551 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar una nueva etapa
6017552 es un hombre humilde que cree en la humildad que es la que nos ha llevado al xito de la eurocopa y en su primer contacto nos ha explicado que es lo que quiere
6017553 se puede crecer de aqu a dos a os el objetivo es el mundial con el nuevo entrenador tenemos dos a os para adaptarnos la base est hecha pero esperamos seguir creciendo porque esta selecci n no ha tocado techo est en nuestras manos la exigencia ahora es otra no vamos a ir de tapados y eso es lo que quer amos tenemos dos a os por delante para seguir creciendo
6017554 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar una nueva etapa
6017555 la gente nos ha contado sus experiencias y la emoci n que ha sentido en cada momento
6017556 vivimos una etapa muy buena con luis aragon s con el que nos sentimos muy unidos todos hab is visto la conexi n que exist a entre seleccionador y jugadores y vamos a intentar hacer lo mismo con el nuevo seleccionador que a medida que pasen los partidos la conexi n sea igual o mejor porque espa a ser la beneficiada
6017557 hay diferencias entre los dos cada entrenador tiene su manera de ser y entrenar vicente es de una manera y luis de otra son dos t cnicos que han conseguido grandes xitos y esperemos que vicente emule lo que ha conseguido en el real madrid en la selecci n espa ola
6017558 la selecci n ha ofrecido un f tbol diferente este verano y agradecemos que le gente lo reconozca

6017561 we can confirm donetsk have lodged a claim with fifa regarding this matter
6017562 as the relevant procedure will start in due course we cant provide further comments for the time being
6017563 the dream of chelsea is broken because real madrid will not even negotiate
6017564 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy
6017565 we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
6017566 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
6017567 i saw the england club doctor and after he had examined my ankle we both agreed that it would be too risky to play against slovenia
6017568 i had a scan on my ankle and theres nothing broken or anything like that
6017569 this has gone through with west brom and we are very pleased
6017570 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar una nueva etapa
6017571 i should have had two goals for the first one michael dawson has ripped my shirt and the referee thought id knocked him over when i spun him
6017572 it was a fantastic day and weve worked a lot on our fitness and it showed even at 90 minutes we didnt fold and got the win
6017573 when we play well i genuinely think we are one of the better teams in the league and we should be aiming quite high
6017574 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar una nueva etapa
6017575 ya se acabaron los homenajes y ahora hay que empezar de nuevo en busca de nuevas victorias
6017576 el camino est trazado ahora hay que saber conservar todo lo bueno que se ha hecho e intentar potenciarlo
6017577 we could all buy the best players in the world if we had an open chequebook but its called managing i have to manage this football club
6017578 i love looking around for loans i enjoy that side of the job and i love that part of the game thats managing
6017579 so i will beg borrow and steal one or two bodies who might do well for us
6017580 ive had great backing and im happy with the money ive had to spend the owner cant just keep pumping millions and millions of pounds in
6017581 if i could go and buy a good right winger now i would do
6017582 if i had the money i would buy shaun wright phillips
6017583 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
6017584 we are still in contact i hope now that rennes will accept to enter into negotiations with this english club
6017585 ive done it its the most incredible feeling and i cant begin to tell you how i feel right now
6017586 it was an insanely tough medal race the weather gave us a little bit of everything but i tried to sail as consistently as i could
6017587 i feel so happy im only 20 and i feel like a superstar i was lucky to have the wind on my side today
6017588 when i finished i counted back and realized i had won bronze i was crazy with joy
6017589 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
6017590 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me he was not fit
6017591 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form
6017592 i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
6017593 i have a squad and all the players are important i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers
6017594 what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality

6017629 however in order to reap the full benefits from connectivity in a long lasting manner underlying issues of policy affordability and technology need to be addressed
6017630 the book looks at the recent experiences of some countries in emerging asia that are improving connectivity the central argument is that connectivity is held back not by technology but by policy and regulatory barriers
6017631 our work on regulation in south asia is driven by the idea that what is appropriate for our countries are simple easy to implement low cost methodologies that is one reason we are developing alternative methods of regulation based on benchmarks the comparative data that we have developed can be used for benchmark regulation
6017632 there is still a large gap between rural and urban telephone growth as highlighted in the book due to flawed policy implementation at the time of writing
6017633 are not as bad off in terms of rural telecom use
6017634 the five south asian countries that we looked at have seen growth in their gsm sectors of more than 40 between september 2006 and january 2008
6017635 through a new business model that we describe as the budget telecom network model akin to the budget airline business model
6017636 connecting more poor people than any number of pilot projects
6017637 we resist this and more organisations in the civil society sector should too for example we have the ridiculous situation in sri lanka where the government is taxing mobile users while exempting diesel vehicles in the name of conservation conservation organization must speak up to defend transport substituting telecom
6017638 indonesia is ahead of india in terms of penetration but not growth while nepal is the only country out of those covered in the book which is far behind india in terms of penetration
6017639 some of the inhibiting policy factors that have contributed to this large urban rural divide are changing now however
6017640 overall we think india has a more robust policy and regulatory system than others though of course it could be better the very powerful role of the department of telecom is problematic
6017641 evidence based policy intervention is something that lirneasia lives by our approach has been successful in influencing policy changes leading to outcomes such as leased line prices dropping substantially in indonesia and the removal of the regressive component of a proposed mobile tax in sri lanka for example this has finally enable more people to get connected to icts
6017642 pleading for free or subsidized services for their projects is counterproductive multiple suppliers are the best long term option for civil society organizations as well as consumers
6017643 the bottom of the pyramid in emerging countries in asia are keen users
6017644 people have a finite amount of money in their communication budgets if that is taken up be cheap mobile services there is less left for other things
6017645 this is something bangladeshs grameen village phone ladies have found now that phone ownership is catching on at the bottom of the pyramid what csos need to do is develop new products and services that will allow access to a larger share of the budget not just the communication portion

6017649 the second quarter was a particularly challenging time for us on top of being a traditionally slow season for us china experienced the tragic wen chuan earthquake in the second quarter of 2008 which not only reduced our advertising airtime due to the suspension and disruption of tv commercials but also affected the success rate for the delivery of our products to areas affected by the earthquake the stricter shipping and delivery guidelines implemented for the 2008 beijing olympics also added additional costs to our business overall we faced a combination of industry specific and macro environment issues nevertheless we met the challenge by continuing to focus on growing those business lines that we set forth to develop at the end of last year in particular we were happy to see both our third party bank sales and ecommerce channels continue to perform well in the second quarter in addition our branded gps product eroda maintained its expected growth for the quarter we will continue to focus on improving our new business lines such as cosmetics third party bank sales and ecommerce to make up for the decline in our other business lines and will make additional investments in new product areas such as jewelry and small home appliances to further diversify our product portfolio and strengthen our overall platform through patience and diligence we remain positive that we have the experience and resources to weather these extraordinary times

6017652 the problems with educational underachievement are concentrated in the poorest areas of the country it is in those areas that our policies for a swedish model of school reform to create thousands more good new school places can make the most difference

6017660 in each case the children fell through the access cover of the rainwater tank and drowned within minutes
6017661 young children are insatiably curious and enjoy exploring their environment their lack of appreciation of any danger compounded by their inability to swim and their failure to call out for help can be a recipe for disaster
6017662 as rainwater tanks are now becoming more common in australia the risk of accidents involving children will inevitably increase it is crucial that we highlight the potential dangers for young children and ensure the tanks are properly secured
6017663 justice roxas is sternly warned that the commission of any act of impropriety in the future will merit a more severe penalty
6017664 this case was simply a harassment suit filed by a losing litigant
6017665 while actions on motions papers and other incidents of a case pending in the court of appeals are actions of that court as a collegial body the 2002 internal rules of the court of appeals provides that it is the ponente who initiates the actions on said motions papers and pleadings he has the primary responsibility of ensuring that the pending incidents in a case assigned to him are properly and promptly acted on

6017675 i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling i could have done better

6017699 organized activity and more time simply to get oneself back into ones right mind e ven for those who find silence and solitude oppressive there is a certain value in just disciplining oneself to be empty and to spend time doing nothing
6017700 if you go into solitude with a silent heart the silence of creation will speak louder than the tongues of men or angels
6017701 the mood i feel at the coast is evident in that
6017702 there will be millions of these images on envelopes across the country
6017703 this birthday party is designed to have all regions know other oregonians and their state

6017708 they are the people who are going to be running the state when we get to the bicentennial in 2059
6017709 i think our whole body of work our whole project is to celebrate where weve come in 50 years and where were going
6017710 if we didnt celebrate until the bicentennial many of my generation wouldnt get a chance to celebrate
6017711 what a great opportunity to get oregonians excited about the state
6017712 i think for a lot of people this is a one shot deal
6017713 for me and many people like me this is it
6017714 i think there is no question that having the perspective of a small town in eastern oregon i have a sense of the breadth and depth of the state
6017715 wenn wir sozialdemokraten in hessen eine minderheitsregierung zustande bringen und diese regierung ordentlich arbeitet dann sehe ich nicht wo der schaden f r die bundespartei sein soll

6017723 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n programme managers
6017724 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
6017725 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
6017726 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
6017727 i was quite annoyed its not sportsmanship when you pull on someones feet
6017728 every part of your body is hurting your stomach is the size of a pea because all the blood rushes to your arms your body is saying stop but your head is saying come on keep going

6017734 en esta regi n el fanatismo de matriz hinduista usa la religi n solo como un pretexto para realizar estos cr menes entre nosotros los cat licos y los religiosos hind es moderados no hay enfrentamiento cuando el di logo tiene que ver con los valores del esp ritu los enfrentamientos son creados por quienes usan pretextos pseudo religiosos
6017735 los fieles de mi di cesis con frecuencia viven en condici n de terror aqu lo cat licos est n en una minor a verdaderamente heroica y significativa en la parroquia en donde ocurri el asesinato son solo cinco familias las que se declaran cat licas por ello acudir regularmente a los servicios religiosos es ahora un riesgo serio
6017736 los campesinos de las reas rurales deben obedecer solo a los latifundistas que son de fe hind ser cristianos y ser en particular cat licos es una elecci n muy valerosa pero

6017969 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
6017970 sometimes i wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it
6017971 he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how
6017972 this is a new situation for the department they havent actually had to do an investigation along these lines before i dont think and they werent clear what process would need to be used
6017973 the energy use associated with the desal plant would be equivalent to some reasonably large country towns
6017974 so a town the size of shepparton or mildura the desal plant will be using as much energy as those towns so its a serious energy user and its going to make it that much harder for us to reduce our greenhouse emissions
6017975 if this argument worked a multitude of other arguments would as well
6017976 an arizona resident could drive without a drivers license and argue that they do not need to get the license because they are a very competent driver who could pass the driving test if they wanted to indeed there is particular irony in redflex a company dedicated to administering programs in which civil fines for illegal speeding are issued in asserting something would only be illegal if it was a criminal violation
6017977 if notice of the fcc certification issue was really what prompted redflex to act it would have extended the same courtesy to its other customers that it extended to dps
6017978 in reality this is a smokescreen redflex knew the issue shielded it from its vendors was hoping dps is so enamored with redflex that it will ignore redflexs intentional violations of the fcc code the idea redflex after having illegally imported marketed distributed and used the agd 340 on behalf of dps can wash its hands of that conduct by saying it did not know the law and that dps would opt to reward that conduct with a contract where one of the primary factors to be considered is the offerors record of performance and integrity strains credulity
6017979 in sport we bow to the numbers and worship the immediate but thats unfairly out of context you dont measure jesse owens against runners 70 years later who have improved equipment training diet its like saying napoleon was a lousy general because he didnt know how to deploy air power
6017980 water marketing as an adaptive response to the threat of climate change
6017981 would generate net social benefits regardless of whether there was a climate change
6017982 the intention is to roll out the protection zone to both northumberland and cumbria in one single extension in line with scheduled vaccine delivery
6017983 this will complete the vaccination roll out by bringing the whole of england into the zone
6017984 protection zone restrictions will apply to those keepers coming into the extended zone
6017985 animals can only be moved out of the zone if they are vaccinated naturally immune or moving for slaughter
6017986 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college

6018008 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6018009 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6018010 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6018011 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6018012 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6018013 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6018014 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6018015 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6018016 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6018017 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6018018 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6018019 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6018020 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6018021 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6018022 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6018023 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6018024 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6018025 they want to know what were going to do about it
6018026 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6018027 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6018028 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls

6018034 to celebrate the launch of its latest wine bin 311 despite a number abcs anything but chardonnay penfolds insight shows it has always been a quality choice for those in the know especially amongst palettes of discerning men recent research reveals that 65 of wine loving british men choose this white wine as their drink of choice ahead of other wines beer and spirits
6018035 the abcs dont appreciate the benefits of enjoying this wine with food and then they tar all chardonnays with the same brush new world chardonnays in particular tend to be creamier in style and make the perfect accompaniment to food and this is definitely understood by male wine lovers and accounts for its popularity
6018036 as the vines in this emerging region have aged and penfolds understanding of the region and its conditions has evolved it seems only natural that we share our experience learned through our iconic chardonnay yattarna in the new penfolds bin 311 tumbarumba chardonnay

6018052 the second quarter was a particularly challenging time for us on top of being a traditionally slow season for us china experienced the tragic wen chuan earthquake in the second quarter of 2008 which not only reduced our advertising airtime due to the suspension and disruption of tv commercials but also affected the success rate for the delivery of our products to areas affected by the earthquake the stricter shipping and delivery guidelines implemented for the 2008 beijing olympics also added additional costs to our business overall we faced a combination of industry specific and macro environment issues nevertheless we met the challenge by continuing to focus on growing those business lines that we set forth to develop at the end of last year in particular we were happy to see both our third party bank sales and ecommerce channels continue to perform well in the second quarter in addition our branded gps product eroda maintained its expected growth for the quarter we will continue to focus on improving our new business lines such as cosmetics third party bank sales and ecommerce to make up for the decline in our other business lines and will make additional investments in new product areas such as jewelry and small home appliances to further diversify our product portfolio and strengthen our overall platform through patience and diligence we remain positive that we have the experience and resources to weather these extraordinary times

6018055 we owe it to our families to do the right thing
6018056 parents of those young adults will have an option to give their children access to adequate health care
6018057 this also invites thousands of additional healthy young adults into insurance pools which can have a positive benefit for everyone
6018058 there are hundreds of thousands who have the option to buy coverage in the private market now that have failed to do so
6018059 if theres just one person whos unhealthy the rates can skyrocket for everyone

6018066 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6018067 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are

6018096 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6018097 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6018098 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop

6018102 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6018103 yet another joyous cathartic and noise blistered flashpoint in a narrative already riddled with them the airborne toxic events sold out headlining set at the el rey did indeed feel like part of a larger story part of the bands appeal to fans beyond inserting subversively literate lyrics into accessible postpunk and new wave is in the sense of mythology that the group generates not in any numb node rust crusted classic rock sense of keening pretentious or self important melodrama and zoso d mystery but simply in the fact that airbornes live performances act almost as chapters in an overarching arc one that concerns the giddy liberation from fear and loss via dance rippled rock n roll

6018105 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6018108 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6018109 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6018110 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6018111 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6018112 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6018113 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6018114 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6018115 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6018116 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6018125 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
6018126 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
6018127 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
6018128 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
6018129 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
6018130 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
6018131 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
6018132 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something

6018148 and it is the same story we see playing out across the gulf coast homes businesses and schools are being rebuilt levees are being repaired families and communities are being reconnected and from biloxi to beaumont hope is being restored
6018149 three years ago this month hurricane katrina left one of americas most beloved cities almost completely underwater he will say
6018150 the storm forced 800 000 people across the gulf coast to leave their homes never before had our nation seen natures destruction on such a vast scale and many wondered whether new orleans could ever come back
6018151 three years ago i stood in jackson square and promised that new orleans would return bush will say recalling his second appearance in new orleans after the storm with a speech from the darkened jackson square on sept
6018152 since then the american taxpayers have committed more than 126 billion dollars for disaster response and recovery on the gulf coast
6018153 most of this money is already in the hands of state and local governments and citizens working to rebuild together we are working to make sure that new orleans comes back even stronger safer and more vibrant than it was before the storm
6018154 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered he will say in new orleans
6018155 and for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming and it is heralded by hopeful signs of progress

6018161 we see hopeful signs of progress in the rebirth of new orleans education
6018162 we see hopeful signs of progress in the return of the normal rhythms of life
6018163 for all of these reasons we can look with optimism toward the bright future awaiting new orleans
6018164 they include people right here at jackson barracks the citizen soldiers of the louisiana national guard
6018165 the people responsible for this citys recovery include the men and women in this audience and those seated behind me
6018166 i am inspired by people like daryn dodson who i met at a dinner here last year
6018167 theres no other place like dr martin luther king jr and theres no other place like new orleans
6018168 dont worry well be home soon be a good boy
6018169 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
6018170 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6018171 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6018172 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6018173 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6018174 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6018175 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6018176 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

6018180 i would like to reassure parents that it is a routine procedure when we find that people in a single class have acquired tb to screen a wider group in this instance we feel it is appropriate to screen the rest of the school
6018181 i am a teacher and instead of having nothing to do over the summer holidays i saw this advert and decided to come to the auditions which were at the end of may
6018182 last time i saw boogie nights was when i last went to blackpool and i thought it was fantastic being here for two weeks makes you realise what it is like to put on a professional performance
6018183 we started rehearsing on saturday august 9 and by the thursday we had managed to put the whole show together
6018184 my favourite song in the show is the last dance and it is played at the end of the first half
6018185 everyone who is in the show gets involved and there is a great atmosphere on the stage
6018186 the music for boogie nights is great and people know so many of the tunes because they are still played in night clubs and bars who doesnt know songs such as ymca
6018187 because im a dance teacher im used to choreographing and at the moment im on a course in london to teach classical ballet
6018188 this is a bit different to that but doing boogie nights is such good fun and the music has really stood the test of time
6018189 i was in a production at my school shelfield sports college and i got a main part so when i saw an advert for the auditions i decided to give it a go
6018190 i just cant wait for the curtain to go up on our first performance i think our families will be amazed at how well we have done
6018191 all publishers are trying to address the difficulties of trading at the moment
6018192 in business terms we had to reduce staff numbers to build for the future
6018193 for our brands to remain intact we simply have to change the way we go about producing our titles in print and online
6018194 i didnt say anyone will have to re apply for their jobs because they wont
6018195 but everyone will have to apply for the new jobs in the new structure
6018196 i intend to take on a new role and help see the titles involved through a difficult transition

6018199 the severe downturn in the housing market hasnt provided him with much work people do things that are out of character when they are in trouble
6018200 he will not be the first person to appear in court for dishonesty because of the current economic climate
6018201 he has worked hard to build up a good career but work is sporadic at the moment and he is unsure of his monthly income
6018202 people like andrew maxwell suffer enough when they appear in court this isnt exactly crime of the century but he is taking it really seriously and in his world it is crime of the century
6018203 a friend told police he had told them he was going to burn out his car and claim on the insurance
6018204 an expert also said the alarm system in the car made it virtually unpinchable
6018205 due to his financial conditions an evening social life is hardly a priority
6018206 people speak very highly of you you are a man of positive character but this was a serious fraud
6018207 we already know that people get different health care up in scotland and this shows that something has to happen
6018208 i have lost two sisters to cancer although they did not have those drugs back then and i think the government needs to fund them
6018209 the meeting was very well attended by both the residents association and the parish council members which made for a successful and constructive meeting
6018210 we are looking forward to working closely with the parish council to find an acceptable solution to this difficult issue
6018211 they were able to give further information on a number of issues and further meetings are planned by the residents association to respond to these
6018212 the grant will enable us to celebrate and share our history with the local community
6018213 the grand has such a special place in the heart of the community and we are delighted to be able to award them this grant to help them build a thorough picture of the theatres history
6018214 one of the goals of the film is to showcase truck drivers as a vital and proud breed of the american workforce
6018215 it chronicles three truck drivers in varying stages in life yet all passionate about their profession and the role they play in the economy
6018216 dealers and customers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of lonestar
6018217 since we unveiled this revolutionary truck in february theres been a buzz throughout the industry anticipating its fall delivery
6018218 drive and deliver and the student film competition are examples of how we are providing truckers an outlet to tell their story and to be a part of their lives

6018221 don joined the scouts when he was a lad he loved going camping and he was always at patshull scout camp
6018222 he just enjoyed helping kids and he would go away for weekends with them

6018224 after an intense training in america we are all hoping to hold on to the gold medals especially as we are on home soil this year
6018225 barefoot water skiing is faster and its an extreme sport so its more of a thrill than normal water skiing
6018226 its an adrenalin boost because youre going at 45mph and if you hit the water you bounce and its like hitting a concrete floor its fun
6018227 in great britain we have two of the best barefoot skiiers in the world in david small and emily goldie they could possibly win the world championship because they can ski at that sort of standard
6018228 everyone is welcome to come down and watch the competition
6018229 the second quarter was an active period during which we began implementing our immediate term strategies while continuing to formulate a comprehensive strategy for our long term growth our progress has been in line with the timetables that we established at the end of march for expanding blue square significantly and enhancing its leadership of israels food and non food retail segments
6018230 our most notable accomplishments over the past few months have been the recruitment of top tier professionals to our management team and the acquisition of the remaining shares of bee group retail an important step in our strategy for establishing blue square as a major non food player we have accelerated the buildout of the eden teva chain with the goal of ending the year with 5 6 of these popular high end stores in parallel we have committed to finalizing and launching our multi year work plan by the end of 2008 several months before our original schedule this plan will take a comprehensive synergistic approach towards achieving several inter related goals leveraging our strong mega brand establishing blue square as a major non food player creating new formats to meet evolving market needs and profiting from the untapped potential of the arab sector with our new sakhnin store which we opened this week with the right strategy a talented and motivated team strong financial backing and a committed board we are confident in our ability to take blue square to a whole new level of revenues and profitability while establishing it as the clear leader of israeli retail

6018244 we had some hard hits go right at them and unfortunately i left some balls leave the ball park
6018245 i kept checking in with lauren to see and her velocity was still up
6018246 she had good bend shed come up with some big strikeouts and got some good quick outs at times and then at other times she struggled
6018247 you have to tip your hat to australia if lauren made a mistake or was even close to a mistake they were all over it and that was the difference in the game and certainly what kept them in it
6018248 those last few games we know were a better team than what the last few games showed and this game is more indicative of the type of team we are
6018249 i cant say for sure but she made a point but didnt receive a point
6018250 must be the machines broken i dont know other coaches were surprised its not only coming from me emotionally

6018257 i think the home crowd advantage gave the chinese gold medal winner a bit of a boost and that was enough to bump jason down into second place but to me he did the best routine today
6018258 i still cant believe it this silver medal is worth gold for me especially with the year i had
6018259 there are talkers and there are doers talk is cheap

6018262 the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6018263 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6018264 do they say in that figure that we can no longer afford bus fares rent hospital fees and that we cant buy groceries if the numbers dont say that then it is meaningless
6018265 when youre going into a hyper inflation cycle until such a time as the authorities take appropriate steps to counter it it seems to continue to spiral out of control

6018269 between april and june 2008 the college held 378 meetings which saved 54 000 in travel expenses and 408 days in time as well as 57 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions the equivalent of a trip from london to singapore for 36 people
6018270 too many working hours spent travelling by internal staff is not only an inefficient use of time but costly and damaging to the environment
6018271 at this point were focused on building our organic strategy
6018272 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
6018273 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
6018274 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
6018275 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
6018276 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on google
6018277 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential
6018278 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n programme managers
6018279 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
6018280 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
6018281 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
6018282 who has the best collection of cup winners medals without having even having been on the pitch in a final
6018283 he was a non playing sub for manchester united when they won the european cup in 1968
6018284 and played only nine minutes in the european cup final for aston villa before limping off in 1982
6018285 he was appointed then he went home not much else to add really
6018286 has a player ever been significantly injured i e needed to be substituted while celebrating a goal
6018287 im particularly thinking of the lualua babayaro gymnastics or perhaps even more painfully a klinsmann style frontal slide gone wrong
6018288 celestine babayaro broke his leg doing on of his trademark somersault goal celebrations on his debut at a pre season game against stevenage
6018289 we therefore didnt see his league debut until months later i dont think he had even scored a goal
6018290 it was the game against man united in november 1997 wengers first full season

6018432 cubas governments ignored their peoples welfare the great masses of peasants were dirt poor
6018433 44 per cent of cubans a higher percentage than americans are covered by social legislation
6018434 one feature of the cuban social structure is a large middle class cuban workers are more unionized proportional to the population than u s workers the average wage for an 8 hour day in cuba in 1957 is higher than for workers in belgium denmark france and germany according to the geneva based international labor organization the average daily wage for an agricultural worker was also among the highest in the world higher than in than in france belgium denmark or west germany cuban labor receives 66 6 per cent of gross national income in the u s the figure is 70 per cent in switzerland 64 per cent

6018437 were not going to say we only saw marvels in those countries
6018438 naturally for a 20th century cuban with all the luxuries which imperialism has accustomed him much of what he saw in eastern europe struck him as belonging to an uncivilized country
6018439 cuba has a tremendous advantage in national integration over other latin american countries because of a largely homogeneous white spanish immigrant base cubas smaller negro population is also culturally integrated those feudal modes of labor that exist in the rest of latin america dont exist in cuba the cuban campesino does not resemble the one in the rest of latin america who is tied to the land and is profoundly tradition bound and opposed to innovations which would link him to a market economy the cuban campesino in all respects is a modern man they have an educational level and a familiarity with modern methods unseen in the rest of latin america

6018532 her presence means nothing absolutely nothing and i am an nkrumaist so i do not want to sound rude otherwise i would have said that in my years in politics i have done more for jomoro than her father ever did
6018533 she is nkrumahs child so what it does not mean anything she should go back to italy or if she wants to stay here she should find something else to do because our people are very discerning if her father was nkrumah she should go to nkroful people do not just vote because her father was somebody what has she done for the people all these years where had she been
6018534 she had never been to the place she has just walked in and thinks that people would vote for her she should go and start campaigning and 7th december would come and elections would take place and she would see where she belongs
6018535 meanwhile the lady i was contesting is well known and had stayed there for long so i was a little jittery when she started to speak nzema to the delegates all i said in nzema was good morning ahioo before my speech and thank you medawase after i had ended but the people voted for me because they bought my message and have faith in me that i can do the job
6018536 there is a lot of goodwill there for me and i hope it would translate into votes on december 7 i get many people telling me they would vote for me i mean people from other political parties they have a lot of belief in me and i do not think i won simply because i am nkrumahs daughter it was not that simple
6018537 everything is a priority for me but certainly i am concerned about the women and the youth i would be working with student groups women groups opinion leaders community heads and the very people who i want to represent in the constituency

6018556 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
6018557 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
6018558 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
6018559 hammersmith amp fulham council has always recognised the importance of bbc television centre and we have done as much as our powers allow to conserve it we are pleased that english heritage is now supporting our position
6018560 the bbc has been part of this boroughs heritage for well over 50 years even before television centre was built when the corporation used shepherds bush empire and riverside studios to record their programmes
6018561 our residents see the bbc as part of their background and heritage and we believe they deserve to keep this part of history we do not want to lose important cultural signposts that are not just architecturally significant but also remind us of great moments in television history
6018562 the centre is truly iconic and key areas need to be preserved for future generations and that is why we support english heritages calls for it to be listed
6018563 the nation has an immense fondness for this building and what it represents for our culture we know the bbc is rightly proud of their building and their heritage and we are enthusiastically working with them to make sure that marking tv centres national importance will not affect its ability to adapt to changing technology or new uses
6018564 we are creating a borough of opportunity and while we welcome the chance to work with developers to regenerate certain parts of hammersmith amp fulham this cannot be at the cost of our well known landmarks
6018565 we regret that the bbc will not be able to make use of the building in the long term but the important parts of it can be a key focus for the regeneration of the area
6018566 the bbc is happy to discuss with english heritage any proposal it has and we will comment to the secretary of state on the historic and architectural merit of tvc in due course
6018567 we have announced that we do not intend to occupy the whole of television centre after 2012 but any reference to detailed development plans for the building or site is premature
6018568 we recognise the historical importance of the building and will be looking for a solution that best preserves the interests of the bbc and of the licence fee payer but there are no firm plans currently on the table
6018569 the lgas proposals to fight fuel poverty and cut carbon emissions have councils at their core
6018570 it is only local government with its intricate knowledge of the countrys housing stock that can deliver a national home insulation programme
6018571 councils are on the front line in the fight against climate change the lga group leaders are now urging all council leaders to lobby their local mps to build up a groundswell of support for our proposals
6018572 a national home insulation programme is the best long term solution to the two challenges of fighting fuel poverty and cutting domestic carbon emissions
6018573 mayflowers money was used to help provide activities for young people during the school summer holidays
6018574 these provided fun challenges for them and activities which some children found were a bit different from what they were used to
6018575 hundreds of youngsters attended and most of the sessions were fully booked
6018576 we spent around 3 000 on organising and implementing the activities a sum also part funded by the police acorn trust the medlock trust and the local community safety team

6018586 the cav has been designed to unlock the growth potential of the local aerospace and aviation industries where local original equipment manufacturers suppliers of components parts and tools and service providers stand to benefit equally from synergistic and economy of scale applications
6018587 while the cav is important to us as a local industry it is interlinked to attracting original equipment manufacturers to south africa and will help us join the international market
6018588 the success of the cav is based on the commercial viability of the cluster to meet the demands of the international aerospace merket
6018589 we recognise the importance of efficient clusters of areas of competence that need to be developed and supported and ultimately integrated into the global aerospace industry
6018590 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss

6018593 please let us know what we can do for you and how we can help you
6018594 maybe you could stop running their commander in chief president bush into the ground about this war maybe you could publicly condemn the harry reids and jim mcdermotts of the world who depress military morale by declaring the wars as not winnable and immoral
6018595 i wish you could all see what i see when i look out at your faces i see america i see what makes our country great
6018596 in the words of one of the finest english authors samuel johnson there is in london all that life can afford and as we prepare to host the greatest sporting event on earth our campaign shows there is no other place to be than here
6018597 tourism in london is big business and a deliverable legacy with a potential 2 2bn incremental revenue opportunity for london alone
6018598 i support this initiative because it will allow our colleges to engage in real education of our students about responsible use of alcohol as well as model moderate behavior at present we are constrained only to talk about abstinence since anything else is against the law treating college students as adults will help them to make more responsible decisions
6018599 signing the statement commits you the college president to describing as clearly and fully and compellingly as you can the place of alcohol in your own campus community that should be a great convocation signing the statement finally commits you to making sure the discussions in which you are engaged or which you will lead are civil informed and dispassionate none of those shrieking parents of dead children killed by a drunk driver weighing all evidence excluding no credible participants always always keeping control of the guest list and considering all policy alternatives no matter how controversial assuming that once the discussion has run its course and all voices have been heard either policy and reality will be seen to be in alignment or policy will be changed to reflect reality more clearly
6018600 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
6018601 nog steeds is er onzekerheid over wat veel banken en financiele instellingen op hun balans hebben staan
6018602 het lijkt meer op het afdekken van shortposities dan iets anders
6018603 traditioneel is outsourcing niet een van ordinas sterke punten wat mogelijk extra uitvoeringsrisicos in de komende kwartalen met zich mee kan brengen
6018604 het bedrijf ligt er goed bij in deze moeizame tijden
6018605 ook in de toekomst zal de vraag naar brandwerende weefsels zich sterk blijven ontwikkelen gelet op de veiligheidseisen van het amerikaanse leger en de toenemende interesse vanuit europa
6018606 deze wordt enerzijds veroorzaakt door economische factoren en sterk stijgende grondstofkosten en anderzijds door de huidige liquiditeitskrapte vanwege de problemen op de financiele markten
6018607 ten cate enbi liet een daling zien van de omzet die vooral werd veroorzaakt door vertragingen van nieuwe projecten
6018608 i am aware there are other issues you think should be subject to discussion between skopje and athens i hope that by solving the name issue the road to better relations will be traced which will contribute towards handling these other issues as well as finding possible solution of them
6018609 as far as the blight its not nearly as bad as it used to be
6018610 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
6018611 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules

6018624 what does it profit my brethren if a man says he has faith but has not works can his faith save him
6018625 so faith by itself if it has no works is dead
6018626 you see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone

6018629 we cant give people so much security with their income that it affects their willingness to work
6018630 we can have equality in access to education and health but not in equality of income
6018631 we had a strong showing in the primary tonight current returns show we have received over 45 percent of the vote to put these results into perspective during the 2004 campaign i received just 34 percent of the vote in the primary and the general election turned out to be significantly closer
6018632 fewer than half of the voters who will vote in november cast their ballots in this primary
6018633 what matters is that we placed in the top two and now the general election begins
6018634 would you rather have your father sing at the supermarket or your mother fart in the principals office

6018645 you should not be able to plead no contest to a sex offense just so you can continue teaching
6018646 if you are innocent you plead innocent and you show the court why youare innocent it is inexcusable to be able to exploit a loophole and jeopardize our children so one can continue teaching
6018647 why a group who represents teachers would want a sex offender teaching in the classroom is beyond me
6018648 the aclu is one thing but for a teachers union to oppose a measure designed to make our schools safer is just plain baffling
6018649 in an era of constant partianship and bickering it is inspiring to see my colleagues join together to vote for a measure which ensures all holders of teaching credentials charged with sex or controlled substance offenses are dealt with appropriately
6018650 we stand ready to offer humanitarian assistance to the government of pakistan if requested in regards to the situation in the tribal regions
6018651 when you think about how we make decisions for cars and mortgages and how we eliminate options based on cost thats not necessarily the case for college

6018653 the ranking sorts by the number of gold medals earned by a country in this context a country is an entity represented by a national olympic committee the number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals if after the above countries are still tied equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically

6018655 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6018656 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6018657 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6018658 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6018659 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6018660 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6018661 theres no question this is an insider versus outsider campaign
6018662 im not surprised by those who are opposing us they want to control our legislature
6018663 what were concerned about is the chance that someone might half consciously check the independent box and then vote the straight democratic party ballot and then have their votes voided
6018664 in america most people believe they are independent with a small i
6018665 that is going to confuse some people and cause a lot of votes to be lost
6018666 every business every home but not everyone has the means to dispose of it themselves and thats where we come in
6018667 you mean people can change the behavior of my classes without my knowledge but thats scary im a fucking weenie shitting myself over the flexibility of it all fuck aop

6018681 ive tried calling and sending emails to town 102 on the phone all they say is bobs on a break
6018682 lets vote with our fingers and switch to another station they may soon get the message then

6018697 it was a pretty light hearted petition so we gave it a light hearted answer a member of staff put it together in a spare half hour

6018700 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6018701 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6018702 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6018703 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6018704 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6018705 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6018706 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6018707 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6018708 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6018709 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6018710 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6018711 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6018712 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6018713 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6018714 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6018715 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6018716 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6018717 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6018718 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6018719 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6018720 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6018721 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6018722 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6018723 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6018724 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6018725 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6018726 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6018727 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6018728 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6018729 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6018730 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6018731 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6018732 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6018733 retailers are mature enough in this industry that they understand that consumers will visit their web sites before they ever visit the store
6018734 ninety percent of consumers go online to research before they buy that makes it even more important to have your brand replicated online because millions of people a day can come and check out your web site
6018735 were probably better friends today after two ventures than we were as kids thats pretty rare
6018736 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6018737 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6018738 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6018739 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6018740 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6018741 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6018742 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6018743 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6018744 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6018745 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6018746 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6018747 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6018748 a 46 year old man has received a formal police caution for being in possession of indecent images of children and placed on the sex offenders register for two years
6018749 do everything in his power to ensure that the trust and faith will not be misplaced
6018750 a year long sabbatical was agreed for mr lee to enable him to discharge the many civic duties that are required of the mayor
6018751 this sabbatical will now extend to the completion of the police investigation that has been reported in the local press and any outcomes that follow from it
6018752 our paramount aim at the school is to work towards as we always do the continued well being achievement and success of our students
6018753 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6018754 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6018755 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6018756 there could be further upside but it will not be that much because of the poor economic outlook in the west
6018757 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6018758 virusen sletter del gger eller tager kontrol din pc kan blive en ufrivillig soldat i et angreb p en offentlig myndighed eller en privat virksomhed

6018763 you guys obviously dont know kenny from the 70s 80s or 90s ill give him the fact that hes a great bowler but thats it maybe hes changed in this decade but i cant forget knowing him for all those years
6018764 seemed to be a step backwards towards confusion rather than a progress towards resolution
6018765 i am really amazed that the nobel peace prize has been given on scientifically incorrect conclusions by people who are not geologists
6018766 the ipcc has actually become a closed circuit it doesnt listen to others it doesnt have open minds
6018767 when i put forward my points in the morning some ipcc official got up to say that what i was saying was nonsense see when we have that sort of attitude that sort of dogma against a scientific observation that would not actually end up in very very positive debate we should maintain our sense of proportion maintain our sense of objectivity allow a discussion not have fixed mindset about global warming
6018768 i think the scientific community is putting way too much faith on these models especially given the fact that they have not been able to predict 5 day weather forecasts yet and weather systems are simpler than the climate and every 5 days they have a chance to test the model and improve it
6018769 a lot of the predictions made by modelers and models do not match very well to the longer term geologic record and even more scary most atmospheric scientists are not aware of that
6018770 we know temperature goes up and down we know there is tremendous amount of natural variations but for how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand we politicians and scientists that the planet is not warming for how many years must cooling go on
6018771 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6018772 in seiner filmrolle als fiete hansen repr sentiert john barron den norden mit viel charme und leidenschaft auch als herausragender musiker berzeugt john sein publikum
6018773 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6018774 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6018775 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6018776 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6018777 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6018778 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6018779 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6018780 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6018781 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6018782 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6018783 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6018784 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6018785 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6018786 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6018787 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6018788 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6018789 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6018790 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6018791 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6018792 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6018793 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6018794 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6018795 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6018796 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6018797 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6018798 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6018799 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6018800 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6018801 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6018802 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6018803 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
6018804 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6018805 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6018806 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6018807 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6018808 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6018809 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6018810 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6018811 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6018812 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6018813 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6018814 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6018815 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6018816 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6018817 breaking through writers block every business letter and template youll ever need for a thriving professional services practice
6018818 what is the one piece of advice youd give a professional service provider to maximize their fees for services
6018819 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
6018820 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6018821 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6018822 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6018823 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6018824 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
6018825 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
6018826 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
6018827 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
6018828 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
6018829 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
6018830 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
6018831 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
6018832 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
6018833 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
6018834 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
6018835 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
6018836 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
6018837 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6018838 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6018839 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6018840 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color

6018856 the biggest gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost and least economic risk will come from nuclear power

6018871 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6018872 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6018873 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
6018874 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
6018875 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
6018876 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign

6018892 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6018893 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6018894 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6018895 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6018896 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6018897 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6018898 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6018899 they told me there are going to be resources here
6018900 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6018901 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6018902 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6018903 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6018904 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6018905 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6018906 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6018907 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6018908 kino ist einfach dann toll wenn man durch die gro e leinwand neue abenteuer und geschichten erleben kann und an orte kommt die man vorher nicht kannte
6018909 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
6018910 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
6018911 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
6018912 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
6018913 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
6018914 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
6018915 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
6018916 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
6018917 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
6018918 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
6018919 theres a sucker born every minute and they are all hillary supporters
6018920 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
6018921 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6018922 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6018923 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6018924 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6018925 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6018926 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6018927 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6018928 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
6018929 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
6018930 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
6018931 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
6018932 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
6018933 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6018934 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6018935 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6018936 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6018937 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6018938 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6018939 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6018940 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6018941 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6018942 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6018943 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6018944 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6018945 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6018946 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6018947 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6018948 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6018949 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
6018950 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
6018951 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
6018952 what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
6018953 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
6018954 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
6018955 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
6018956 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
6018957 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
6018958 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
6018959 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
6018960 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
6018961 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
6018962 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
6018963 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
6018964 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
6018965 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
6018966 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
6018967 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
6018968 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea rice told reporters ahead of the ceremony
6018969 it is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms our cooperation and relationship with poland
6018970 it will deepen our defence cooperation and it will deepen our ability to deal with threats
6018971 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned russian president dmitry medvedev said last month as the missile talks moved to a close
6018972 this certainly is sending a message to the government to lift its performance lift its game to myself to work harder mr iemma told nine
6018973 its obviously had an impact you can see that he said
6018974 i wont rule it out i wont rule anything in or out at this point in time he said
6018975 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6018976 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6018977 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6018978 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6018979 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6018980 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6018981 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6018982 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6018983 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6018984 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6018985 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6018986 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6018987 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6018988 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6018989 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6018990 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6018991 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6018992 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6018993 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6018994 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6018995 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6018996 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6018997 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6018998 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6018999 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6019000 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6019001 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6019002 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6019003 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6019004 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6019005 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6019006 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6019007 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6019008 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6019009 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6019010 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6019011 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6019012 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6019013 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6019014 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6019015 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6019016 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6019017 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6019018 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6019019 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6019020 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6019021 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6019022 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6019023 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6019024 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6019025 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6019026 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6019027 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6019028 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6019029 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6019030 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6019031 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6019032 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6019033 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6019034 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6019035 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6019036 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6019037 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6019038 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6019039 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6019040 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6019041 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6019042 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6019043 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6019044 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6019045 it doesnt annoy or confuse me i dont think any of us think that just because we opened for some bands that are more well known than us that were entitled to some sort of amazing record deal some bands good or bad get signed after playing one show some bands again good or bad never get signed if it was a choice between being something ridiculous like the kooks or something thats completely amazing but by the wayside like the shaggs id choose the latter without hesitation
6019046 i have no problem with bands making a quick buck becoming local celebrities and then splitting up two weeks later but its certainly not something id want to be involved in
6019047 that said wed obviously like to put records out and for as many people to hear and like it as possible
6019048 i cant explain how it happens our biggest influences are probably each other
6019049 im not too sure who influences me i guess its a combination of everything ive ever listened to or read both good and bad i dont think its something you can really filter all that much or control so its difficult for me to cite specific influences
6019050 its nothing we really think about there are good venues and a small group of people doing good things for its size it more than punches above its weight for its size in terms of touring bands and venues as for local bands though none of us are really that clued up we only really know a few people
6019051 i used to really hate it playing live as id get stupidly nervous and always think that i hadnt played as well as i should have
6019052 both recording and playing live can be equally fun i love the satisfaction you get from hearing a finished version of something thats been in your head practice room for months live though theres that random element anything could happen at any time good or bad
6019053 will you let me go to hell however i choose
6019054 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
6019055 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
6019056 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

6019065 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
6019066 blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him
6019067 god uses broken things it takes broken soil to produce a crop broken clouds to produce rain broken grain to give bread broken bread to give strength it is the broken alabaster box that gives forth perfume it is peter weeping bitterly who returns to greater power than ever
6019068 i issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the god of daniel 3 shadrach meshach and abednego
6019069 praise be to the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who has sent his angel and rescued his servants they trusted in him and defied the kings command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own god 29 therefore i decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble for no other god can save in this way
6019070 he gave up his ghost to heaven and we will miss him always
6019071 the soil was quite soft so the tires got stuck
6019072 we were surprised the plane suddenly stopped at the other end of the runway then we were told to disembark

6019074 aba pag sinabi mong renegotiation the possibility of every item bubusisiin na naman
6019075 the issuance by the honorable court of a temporary restraining order tro coupled by present conditions in some areas in mindanao dictate that the moa in its present form must undergo a thorough review
6019076 in fact the executive department will pursue further negotiations with the milf to address the issues hurled against the moa
6019077 you noticed that the language says it will undergo further review and that the negotiations shall be further undertaken with the end view of reaching a final peace agreement so there is no need to strike down the moa
6019078 now we will have to await what the supreme courts response will be to the manifestations of the solicitor generals office
6019079 i think it goes without saying when they said there will be a thorough review and that they will pursue further negotiations it indicates that the flaws that may have been observed in the existing moa need to be reviewed in light of the things that came out as a result of the petitions submitted before the supreme court
6019080 indeed there are major items that need to be reviewed in the moa if we want to come up with something more acceptable to the public
6019081 i dont know if well ever know the answer to that question
6019082 i dont think the us is to blame for whats happening in georgia
6019083 burns is a person who as undersecretary of state until recently was part of forming the us policy towards georgia
6019084 we must not be part of the redrawing of lines in europe
6019085 we should not allow this current situation to draw new lines in europe and prevent a democratically elected government to join nato if they want
6019086 we were right to support the right of independence for kosovo
6019087 the us tried very hard and assertively to support kosovos independence but to not make it a precedent
6019088 what the administration doesnt understand is that whats a precedent is in the eyes of the beholder
6019089 we dont get to decide how other people react to what we do
6019090 that means that the leaders of the abkhaz and south ossetians are not on the same legal grounds as the democratically elected leaders of georgia or the leader of russia
6019091 if you asked the people in those two regions where they want to live in terms of independence or under the georgian state its quite clear that the leadership is representative of that
6019092 rice is more filling it doesnt matter if we have fish or vegetables if theres rice we feel more satisfied
6019093 we cant rely on rice imports because what will happen to us if rice exporters decide not to sell can we force them to sell rice to us
6019094 the philippines is fighting a battle against nature that its rice exporting neighbors are spared
6019095 improvements in production technology can play a big role in reducing the problem of rice shortage in the philippines and generally appear to have very high returns that can raise economic growth
6019096 instead of spending a lot of money to import rice the government should use it to support filipino farmers
6019097 investments for rural infrastructure development and other support services have dwindled from 0 24 of the countrys gross value added agriculture gva in 1995 1999 to a mere 0 07 in 2000 2005 this is particularly true for irrigation which contributes about 25 of rice production increase this meagre investment in the rice sub sector has affected its production performance and weakened its competitive position in the world market vis a vis the other southeast asian countries
6019098 it can just repair and rehabilitate existing facilities or spend on small scale communal irrigation systems
6019099 there is strong evidence that the returns from investments in research and development in developing country agriculture are extremely high r amp d can help improve farmers incomes while helping hold down the price of staple foods to consumers
6019100 this is far below the 1 level recommended for developing countries and very much lower than the 2 3 observed in many countries
6019101 president yoshimi yasuda chose not only to violate this agreement but also turned defiant telling me if you are dissatisfied with the decision not to pay the bonuses either quit the company or sue it
6019102 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
6019103 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6019104 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july
6019105 if we dont find these guys by the election they are going to stick the whole nuclear mess up our a hole
6019106 they will be seen as standing in the way of lower income singaporeans who want to upgrade themselves and move up the salary ladder
6019107 lower income singaporeans cannot afford to have their wages depressed further
6019108 are not here to steal our jobs but to help us enlarge the economic pie
6019109 if we have more immigrants than genuine singaporeans you become a different people we must have that core at least 65 of people born and bred who understand this place who are part of this society and who know how we got here and why we must do these things
6019110 to be honest i am not sure if i would like to be around to live in a singapore that will be so crowded
6019111 inflation accelerated to 27 in july overtaking sri lanka as the fastest rate in asia
6019112 wal mart the worlds largest retailer said its july sales at us stores open at least a year or same store sales rose 3 percent
6019113 the consumer price index was up 5 6 year over year in the latest report
6019114 fair to say that sales actually slumped 2 6 this month at wal mart in real purchasing power but wait there is more also noteworthy is the fact that the three main items that consumers go to wal mart for are groceries flat screen television sets and gasoline considering that prices in energy rose 34 7 and food rose by 6 6 this report is borderline disastrous
6019115 companies throughout the food chain are changing the way they do business in response to soaring grain costs and consumers are likely to bear the brunt in the form of rising food prices
6019116 farmers are making the broadest cuts to their livestock herds in decades meaning meat at the supermarket will likely cost more in coming years
6019117 since 1980 per capita meat consumption in china has nearly tripled the price of pork has jumped more than 50 in one year yet the butcher shops remain packed
6019118 the chinese eat more pork than the rest of the world combined the country consumes seven times as much as the number two consumer the united states and consumption is increasing according to the usda chinese pork consumption rose 22 between 2002 and 2006
6019119 resulted in a 9 decline in chinese pork production chinese pork prices rose 68 between april 2007 and april 2008
6019120 the potential for further chinese importation of pork is almost incomprehensible
6019121 middlemen are trying to shorten the duration of supply contracts to 90 days from one year so they can pass on higher costs more quickly and food brands are shrinking the contents of their packages from ice cream cartons to beverage containers
6019122 taken together there is a growing climate of fear and intolerance
6019123 tolerance for dissent and freedom of media is narrowing what little media freedom existed is now under severe threat
6019124 they umno are weak while the opposition is gaining ground the series of repressive measures must be seen in that light as an attempt to curb freedom and defend the political status quo
6019125 the court order to reveal sources and identity of commentators is having a chilling effect on bloggers
6019126 they are worried that multi million dollar sedition or defamation suits may follow
6019127 if the authorities find the book to be false or misleading then they should put up a case through rebutting it
6019128 the government must have the courage to engage in public debate and win the battle for public opinion
6019129 we should not tolerate or condone extreme acts aimed at curbing legitimate public discussion
6019130 we must uphold the right of malaysians to exercise their freedom to dissent and even to engage in peaceful demonstration in defense of their concerns
6019131 sends a clear message that current western strategy in afghanistan is failing
6019132 until now western leaders have been in denial about the true extent of taliban presence in afghanistan and their ability to move swiftly on the afghan capital
6019133 all sorts of social political and economic vacuums are growing in muslim societies and it is an historical fact that in the muslim world the reaction to such situations has always emanated from movements led by the religious forces
6019134 is becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict

6019225 at the recent linux world event we have known about the company behind ubuntu it indirectly referred to a big announcement that tied ubuntu to the coming netbook and we have been waiting for that news for quite long time
6019226 the interesting part of the story is that the version of ubuntu with the dell machines will be the new netbook remix edition
6019227 this new version of ubuntu is the best for the atom processor and it has a new big button interface very similar to those found in the aspire one and eeepc
6019228 the coming dell machine would provide us an opportunity to note what canonical has been doing during all summer and it would certainly cast a considerable impact on the netbook market
6019229 we now believe sales to china will be lower than previously expected for the second half of the year and this will have some effect on second half profitability

6019247 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare

6019249 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
6019250 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
6019251 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land

6019280 nous avions envisag la possibilit dattaquer les infrastructures au liban mais cette option navait pas t retenue car nous avions estim l poque que tous les libanais n tait pas responsables des attaques du hezbollah
6019281 nous avons affaire des ennemis cruels aussi bien au liban qu gaza et isra l doit pouvoir leur r pliquer
6019282 letat libanais comme un ennemi mais partir du moment o le hezbollah a pris le contr le du gouvernement libanais nous devons en tirer les cons quences
6019283 nous disposions de moyens beaucoup plus massifs que ceux que nous avons utilis s car nous combattions une organisation terroriste et non un etat mais si le liban devient un etat du hezbollah nous ne nous imposerons aucune restriction

6019290 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
6019291 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
6019292 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

6019294 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays

6019296 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorse its findings
6019297 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6019298 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6019299 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6019300 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6019301 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6019302 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

6019328 we are getting into a territory where growth rates are going to slowdown inflation expectations have not yet peaked and therefore its likely that its a stagflation scenario which is completely anti equity
6019329 one will still be able to pickup quality stocks because they are down 50 60 from the peak one still believes that there is an eight ten years secular growth story that can be played out we are still okay with software so rather than taking sheer market call it call depends upon whether one has got long term investment horizon whether one is long short whether one is long only all those options are there next six eight months i would tend to believe are difficult for the equity markets
6019330 buat apa setia setia kalau orangnya begitu tampangnya juga jelek miskin lagi kamu kok mau maunya sama dia tinggal saja laki laki tidak hanya satu di dunia ini kamu jangan buta itu dia yang sudah menyebabkan dia jadi berani berbuat seenaknya pada kamu sebab kamu terlalu sayang sama dia cinta boleh tapi terlalu cinta itu berbahaya jangan jangan kamu sudah kena peler
6019331 itu bukan nasehat itu perintah kalau nanti hubungan mereka putus bagaimana
6019332 hukum alam apa itu berarti ami ikut ambil bagian memutuskan hubungan orang

6019335 tapi buktinya ibu kan jadinya kawin dengan aku coba dengan lelaki bejat itu entah bagaimana nasibmu sekarang
6019336 biarin orang jahat itu mesti diberikan pelajaran tegas bu kalau tidak nanti kita yang akan dikejami sama dia berbuat kasar berbuat jahat sama bajingan itu boleh lihat saja bagaimana kita menjerat koruptor dan tukantg tukang suap itu kalau teleponnya tidak disadap bagaimana kita dapat bukti kejahatannya mereka itu hantu hantu semua tidak kelihatan jadi mesti dipancaing dipergoki biar kapok biar tahu rasa
6019337 bukan bapakmu bilang bahwa perlakuan kasar kepada orang jahat itu boleh tapi ibu tidak setuju menurut ibu perlakuan kasar itu tidak boleh kepada siapa pun baik kepada orang baik maupun kepada orang jahat
6019338 bukan begitu kalau kita mau melawan kejahatan tidak boleh dengan kejahatan itu sama saja
6019339 ya tunjukkan saja kepada orang jahat itu bahwa kejahatan itu tidak menghasilkan apa apa kejahatan itu akan gagal dan kegagalan itu dengan cara menunjukkan bahwa kita tidak mau ikut jahat biar dia tahu tujuan tidak akan bisa dicapai dengan kejahatan
6019340 kok kelihatannya banyak pikiran sekarang katanya kejahatan tidak bisa dilawan dengan kejahatan
6019341 o itu ibumu tidak setuju kalau tukang suap dan koruptor itu ditangkap dengan cara menyadap telepon mereka ibu menganggap penyadapan itu bukan tindakan yang bagus tidak baik diberlakukan kepada siapa pun bahkan kepada penjahat pun tidak boleh
6019342 karena mungkin dia merasa bersalah sudah nguping kamu menghasut teman kamu supaya putus dengan pacarnya
6019343 ya ibu kamu tidak setuju kamu kok berani beraninya menyarankan agar teman kamu itu memutuskan pacarnya meskipun orang itu jahat bapak lalu menunjukkan kepada ibumu bahwa kejahatan itu harus dihentikan dengan kekasaran sebab demi kebaikan orang jahat itu harus dipaksa dengan cara apa pun melihat kejahatannya sendiri seperti kpk menjebak para tukang suap dan para koruptor kejahatan itu dibenarkan untuk menegakkan keadilan jadi nguping itu tidak apa apa asal
6019344 jadi ibu sudah nguping percakapan ami dengan lidia di kampus
6019345 ya maafkan ibu ami tapi ibu minta jangan mencampuri urusan pribadi orang lain tak baik
6019346 kejahatan tidak usah dilawan dengan kejahatan kebaikan yang muncul dari kejahatan itu tidak akan langgeng

6019574 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
6019575 participating eligible communities flood insurance may be written only in those communities that have been designated as participating in the national flood insurance program nfip by the federal emergency management agency fema
6019576 prior to the creation of the nfip floodplain management as a practice was not well established only a few states and several hundred communities actually regulated floodplain development
6019577 since the federal government does not have land use authority the nfip is based on the federal governments power to spend under the constitution rather than any federal authority to regulate land use
6019578 under the nfip regulations participating nfip communities are required to regulate all development in sfhas
6019579 when a community chooses to join the nfip it must adopt and enforce minimum floodplain management standards for participation
6019580 floodplain management refers to an overall community program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing future flood damage these measures generally include zoning subdivision or building requirements and special purpose floodplain ordinances
6019581 no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions which the director finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use
6019582 if a community chooses not to participate flood insurance is not available from the nfip moreover if a president declares a disaster as a result of flooding federal financial assistance will not be available for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable buildings
6019583 communities must ensure that their adopted floodplain management ordinance and enforcement procedures meet program requirements local regulations must be updated when additional data are provided by fema or when federal or state standards are revised
6019584 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
6019585 after the great flood of 1993 thousands of properties in flood plains around the midwest were bought out by the government now weeks after the latest massive flood buyouts are again being considered in at least five states missouri iowa wisconsin indiana and illinois residents in areas that qualify can choose to sell their properties to their city or county with 75 percent of the costs paid by the federal emergency management agency communities that use the fema dollars agree to demolish structures on the properties and not develop the land except for recreational use such as parks
6019586 despite the wide array of tools and techniques to operationalize the principles of sustainable development
6019587 ironically the time immediately following a natural disaster provides a community with a unique window of opportunity for inserting an ethic of sustainability in guiding development and redevelopment in high risk areas with forethought and planning communities that are rebuilt in the aftermath of a natural hazard can be built back so that they are more resiliant to future hazards breaking the pattern of repeated hazard destruction rebuilding at the same time the community is given the opportunity to incorporate other attributes of sustainability into its second chance development such as energy efficiency affordable housing use of recycled building materials reduction of water use and environmental protection

6019613 non si deve pensare tuttavia che addomesticando un cane lo si renda meno intelligente ma un dato di fatto che il suo comportamento si fa pi complicato in particolari situazioni sociali ed vero che focalizzando la propria attenzione sui padroni spesso lo porta a comportamenti errati
6019614 che essi fossero altamente motivati a divertirsi con un gioco

6019654 its difficult when you make a new record and you wanna play all the new songs live but with technology these days therell be someone out there with a recorder and it kinda spoils it for us you dont wanna play too many new songs because otherwise theyll be on youtube or something so we have to pick and choose if it was up to us wed play all the new songs because theyre so fun to play
6019655 they all served their purpose and in that respect im proud of all of them
6019656 but as something that feels artistically in keeping with who i am today i think that they are inevitably going to fall short of that as time goes on i mean they just dont continue to mean the same things to me and a new record is kind of where its at

6019793 childminders are in short supply ive never ever had to advertise my services as a childminder
6019794 i do appreciate there has to be regulation of some sort but they are expecting us to do what nurseries do
6019795 there is a place for nurseries but they have extra staff who they employ to do all that paperwork

6019798 the early years foundation stage eyfs is based on the advice of qualified early years professionals and we consulted widely on it and its supported by the national childminding association who say the eyfs is a positive development
6019799 the number of registered childminders has always varied over time for a number of reasons

6019806 we have around 55 dogs here at the moment and we just cant take anymore
6019807 it is also proving very expensive because the more dogs we have to look after the higher the cost and because we rely on donations we need all the help we can get
6019808 if we werent here these dogs would have nowhere to go and no one to look after them
6019809 but we need the help of the public in providing us with things like bedding disinfectant dog food and anything else
6019810 it has never been as tough as this at the centre times are hard a lot of it is because the police dont take in dogs anymore so we are getting a lot more to cope with
6019811 people can actually go up to the centre for a day out and play with the dogs a bit and it is great
6019812 you take along some donations like dog food or blankets and it is a lovely day out for a family

6019914 he asked me to turn the light on and i could tell something was clearly wrong the right side of his face was covered in blood he was crying and not making any sense i called his friend who is a nurse who tended his wounds and i thought he would just wake up the next day but he deteriorated

6019920 i woke up in the night and i thought someone was in the house then i went to the window and saw the neighbours out in the street and smoke coming from the caravan i couldnt see the lads inside the car because the windscreen was shattered it wasnt until the fire brigade took the roof off the car that police told me there were two lads inside
6019921 everyone is in shock i just needed to come down and see where it happened i was with him five minutes before i thought he had just gone back to his mates house
6019922 im still in shock and it hasnt really sunk in yet they were both typical young lads who both just really enjoyed life
6019923 i travel here daily on the trains and it has become a concern that stealing cabling is virtually epidemic the train i travel on is delayed very regularly because people such as this defendant choose to steal the cabling this sort of offence is happening time and time again causing disruption and inconvenience and financial losses to many people who travel on trains when they were anticipating they would run on time

6019928 now listen the police cant hit you but i can
6019929 i have been tremendously privileged to have had the opportunity to be linked through my work to the police who are the most wonderful people i came into this job to try to help people and that is what i hope i have done to the best of my ability i am full of admiration and affection for the people of stockport who have shown wonderful kindness and support for me and for the remarkable courage they have shown in some of their darkest hours
6019930 i first met arthur during my ministry at st andrews presbyterian church heaton moor in the 1960s we quickly became good friends and were very involved in the work of the free church federal council and together with canon wilfred garlick in the activities of the stockport council of churches arthur apart from his ministry at tiviot dale methodist church exercised a voluntary and itinerant ministry to the people of stockport there were countless occasions when families suffered a bereavement under tragic circumstances desperately needing real caring support and the first place everyone would think to turn was to send for arthur connop arthur had an attractive personality with a lively sense of humour he was always good company he was a man of god and a man of the people
6019931 arthur loved stockport and stockport people he was a kind wonderful man who always had time for everyone he played a major part in comforting people at the time of the stockport air disaster and also in his work with the police he was truly a man of god and i am deeply saddened by his loss
6019932 at 7 35pm on friday may 20 1983 we had a knock at our front door i opened it to be met with the face of arthur who had called to inform us of our sons tragic car accident michael was only 17 when we lost him in our familys time of need we could always turn to arthur to calm our sadness and from that moment until late in his life he was always there to talk with us in our many hours of need im sure many families have suffered as we have done and feel indebted to arthur for his warm and compassionate ways it was with great sadness to learn of the passing of one very very dear friend in arthur thank you arthur for being there and most of all for being you god bless you
6019933 what special and lovely man arthur was we lost our son philip aged 19 years old and rev connop was so kind to us and our family he made the funeral service so special at such a sad time for us and would ring us up after the funeral to see how we were he will be sadly missed
6019934 having reflected on the two draws i think its been a respectable start but nothing more than that weve got to use this as a platform to build on now weve played well in both games defended well and looked solid as a team and we look like we can play good football we just need to work hard to make sure were more effective in our attacking play especially on counter attacking and setplays weve acquitted ourselves very well which is encouraging but it is going to be tough for the players to put in that kind of effort week in week out our opponents wont all be as good as huddersfield and leicester but we will have to be at our best in most games and thats demanding in itself
6019935 theres not a great deal of money available if we are to make any more signings we will have to be prudent when considering who we bring in
6019936 in order to have the harry potter effect you just need to find the right materials for the visible wavelengths
6019937 and its absolutely thrilling to see were on the right track
6019938 despite winning promotion we froze ticket prices again this season to reward our amazing fans loyalty and were absolutely thrilled with their response to sell more season tickets than when we played in division one is incredible
6019939 these first three games of the season have for me shown that we shouldnt fear anyone in the first game against huddersfield i felt we were the better team then at leicester last tuesday we worked extremely hard although of course having a man sent off early didnt help us leicester showed just what a good side they are at edgeley park there arent going to be many better than them but looking at ourselves weve just got to keep improving i dont think weve got out of the starting blocks yet we need to play at a quicker tempo and be more confident about playing our own game rather than worrying about other teams were happy enough with a point from saturdays game but there is still plenty of room for improvement its still going to take a while to see who are going to be the stronger teams in league one this season but weve just got to look to establish ourselves at this level not fear anyone and keep pushing on it doesnt matter who were going to play though im sure the wins will come very soon
6019940 i thought we made hard work of saturdays game all the lads were a little bit disappointed with our performance of course leicester are going to be one of the strongest teams in our division this season but as for ourselves i thought we were a bit hesitant we didnt quite get into our stride
6019941 essa mesma liga o entre a igreja e a cidade que a diocese quer recordar avivar e celebrar

6019946 its falling apart the developers at grand central and at hopes carr have both gone very very quiet and i know the council has recently been trying to gee them up but nothing is happening the real worry about this is that the recession in the 1980s took eight years to recover so we are not looking at anything happening very quickly the council should have seen this coming a lot quicker than they did other towns have got going much quicker than us
6019947 as a council we should be seeking to reassure our other development partners that we remain fully committed to regenerating the heart of stockport as long as the council takes pro active steps and keeps talking to our development partners there is little reason why this should have a negative impact on other projects in the borough
6019948 terrace hill remains committed both to its gorsey bank development and the local area and believes that stockport will benefit from regeneration activity over the coming years for all developers however decisions on timing and viability do depend on prevailing market conditions we continue to work up plans for our scheme and look forward to providing an update on progress at gorsey bank in due course
6019949 we are on a sound financial footing really and grand central is very much still going ahead we got planning permission about two months ago now and we are just putting all the pieces in place before we start work on the project
6019950 theres a lot of work going on in the background and we are still very confident
6019951 we continue to work on commercial and legal aspects of the scheme and we are pleased with progress
6019952 our commitment to bringing a new sainsburys to stockport is as strong as ever
6019953 it creates a political situation that the legislature cannot ignore
6019954 our discretion is much more limited than what most of the appellants and especially the public understand it
6019955 there have been times where there have been people who have been very disappointed
6019956 sometimes there were very good policy reasons to deny a permit as far as environmental protection but none of it fell within the authority we had
