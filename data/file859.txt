8590021 under our mid term business plan we aim to increase sales from the aerospace business to 200 billion and start to develop the subaru jet within 10 years
8590022 however the aerospace company will not use resources from other fhi businesses to ensure that the programme is viable from the start therefore it makes sense to proceed with the programme only after the aerospace business becomes more profitable
8590023 it is unclear which kind of business jet will be in demand vljs like the eclipse or a midsized aircraft like the h4000 and with the global economy slowing down and high oil prices affecting everyone the sector could be adversely affected we will take our time to fully understand the market fully before making a decision

8590078 hay un grado de razonabilidad muy grande sobre todo en el reconocimiento de que esto es algo absolutamente habitual y que existe en nuestra sociedad la abrumadora mayor a lo ha aceptado de a poco en nuestro pa s va avanzando ya hay provincias que tienen sus leyes y ciudades que lo han incluido en sus cartas org nicas
8590079 no es usual que en los textos constitucionales se dispongan este tipo de previsiones el matrimonio est regulado en el c digo civil y si regulamos una situaci n a la que queremos darle efectos similares deber amos hacerlo por ley

8590085 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
8590086 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8590087 met the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8590088 this is a very satisfying sentence from a police point of view it sends out a clear message

8590090 the facts prove that effective action to end child poverty would make a vital long term contribution to improving the health of our nation and prevent avoidable incidences of physical and mental ill health
8590091 the government made a bold promise to halve child poverty by 2010 and this now requires bold action
8590092 acute illnesses are more likely to affect poor children and they are more likely to experience hospital admission which in turn is placing an unnecessary amount of strain on health services
8590093 if poverty were an infection then we would be in the midst of a full scale epidemic with all the attendant public health measures including vaccination
8590094 i will be stopping calvin and hobbes at the end of the year this was not a recent or an easy decision and i leave with some sadness my interests have shifted however and i believe ive done what i can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels i am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace with fewer artistic compromises i have not yet decided on future projects but my relationship with universal press syndicate will continue that so many newspapers would carry calvin and hobbes is an honor ill long be proud of and ive greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure and i thank you for giving me the opportunity

8590106 they are attractive items for those connected to organised criminal networks
8590107 if you have one of these readily available you will be targeted by other criminals who want to take it off you
8590108 in 2004 we started having shootings with mac 10s whereas we had not had them before there was a sea change
8590109 it is clear that the usage in crimes in the uk of mac 10s can be directly linked to the factory at the briars
8590110 one of the integral problems with these weapons is they do not necessarily hit your intended target
8590111 they also have difficulty stopping and starting them they go off and they are difficult to keep in single fire
8590112 here we have an armoury in the suburbs of berkshire creating and manufacturing deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8590113 these dangerous weapons have clearly already hurt and killed too many people and therefore we urgently need to recover them to stop anyone else getting murdered or injured
8590114 todays figures defy hopes that the housing market is bottoming out any time soon
8590115 i dont think we are quite there at the bottom yet but there are some encouraging signs
8590116 once that is resolved particularly if it is resolved favourably there are signs that an increasing number of people are beginning to sniff around but it would be optimistic to expect the market to start to recover this year
8590117 while activity indicators at the start of the homebuying process are showing some signs of stabilising prices will continue to fall back while finance remains constrained
8590118 government incentives to revitalise the mortgage market need to be enacted sooner rather than later to contain the wider impacts of falling house prices on the economy
8590119 the economy is looking pretty bad and there is no end in sight to the reduction in the availability of mortgage credit i dont think there are any bright signs

8590161 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8590162 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8590163 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8590164 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8590165 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber

8590192 while organic growth remains strong in food ingredients usa and nutritionals the performance of food ingredients ireland in the second half will be reduced relative to the second half of 2007 as global dairy market volatility has created a time lag in balancing input costs and market returns

8590216 what is confusing people is that youre seeing rustock bots sending out emails that essentially infect people with srizbi so they think it must be srizbi thats sending it but its not
8590217 srizbi is not just one big model its rented out to lots of different spammers
8590218 it could be because they want to separate their malware seeding operation from their spamming operation
8590219 maybe their bots are getting blacklisted faster when theyre sending out urls with fake video files because theyre easy to spot so their spam doesnt get through so they send malware from this botnet and spam from this one to keep out of the blacklists longer
8590220 back in the neighborhood where the crime was perpetrated and where the victim and her family continue to live
8590221 this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
8590222 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
8590223 is the principal drag on american capitalism and american prosperity
8590224 people have been saying solar is out in left field and today we are out in left field of coors field
8590225 by tuesday id lost my voice talking to people its a fundamentally different convention than in the past
8590226 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
8590227 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8590228 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8590229 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8590230 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8590231 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8590232 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8590233 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8590234 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing
8590235 mi mejor consejo para aquellos que quieran que sus hijos crezcan felices y mentalmente sanos es mantenedlos los m s lejos posible de una iglesia
8590236 sin desviarse de las normas el progreso no es posible
8590237 tienes una pata de palo te convierte eso en una mesa
8590238 si tienes una vida aburrida y mediocre es por haber escuchado a tu mami a tu papi a tus profesores a los curas o a alg n tipo en la tv dici ndote como hacer las cosas as que te lo mereces

8590243 we have lost the appeal that means he will be extradited it will probably be within the next fortnight he is absolutely devastated by the decision he and his family are distraught they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8590244 members have indicated clearly that they are not prepared to accept below inflation pay or a repeat of last years 10 month delay staff are feeling betrayed and management and the government need to act quickly in order to avoid embarrassing industrial action in acas
8590245 with the government losing the goodwill of the people who deliver the everyday things we take for granted there is a rapid need for it to rethink its approach to public sector pay

8590272 the caltongate plans should have been refused by this council at the first opportunity
8590273 the biggest concern is the effect this will have on the citys world heritage status yet i was told at the last meeting on this subject that it was scaremongering to suggest that this development could cost us that
8590274 if we feel we need modern developments in a gap site we will take the decision
8590275 it would be illogical to stop a development that we have carefully considered
8590276 im not surprised although i had hoped they might consider it in a bit more detail we will now be urging ministers to order a full public inquiry
8590277 caltongate offers a once in a generation opportunity to significantly improve the fabric and feature of edinburghs old town
8590278 having gone by taxi when he was an ordinary msp and by car and plane after he became first minister it now turns out one of his only two train journeys was in the united states
8590279 we are constantly being urged to use public transport but the first minister is not setting a good example he probably has one of the biggest carbon footprints in scotland
8590280 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
8590281 thatchers economics had at their core the belief that mass unemployment was not just a price worth paying but necessary in a modern economy
8590282 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of thatcher and i think here her social message epitomised in the unfair poll tax and her comments of no such thing as society cut against a very scottish grain of social conscience
8590283 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her lack of concern for social consequences even less
8590284 it wasnt a slip its what he believes he was sitting having a cosy chat with a rising star of the tory party who isnt a real journalist he must have felt very comfortable and he just came out with it
8590285 the snp has managed to convince a large section of scots that they are more left wing than labour
8590286 but being relaxed about thatchers economic policies does let the cat out of the bag and its consistent with their pro business low tax stance
8590287 the snp wants irish levels of taxation and scandinavian levels of public services but there is a contradiction there and they cant quite make up their minds
8590288 whereas at uk level labour talked right to act left because its centre right aspirational voters who decide elections in scotland which is traditionally left of centre the snp talks left to act right
8590289 that was a bigger sea change than many people realised at the time the tories were no longer the bogeymen we could do deals with them
8590290 the party has not tied up its economic and social justice arguments there are a lot of short term fixes going on we need to do a bit more thinking

8590297 ppi for july comes in much higher than expected although electricity price hikes were widely anticipated the shock value of this will come as a timely reminder to the market
8590298 sure lower oil prices are the big hope here that eventually the worst of the pressure will abate but with ppi already at such a high level it is a bit of a gamble that the amount of tightening seen so far will be sufficient and that there will be only moderate passthrough from strong pipeline pressures to consumer inflation

8590305 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8590306 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8590307 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8590308 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8590309 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend
8590310 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments
8590311 our manufacturing operations in asia have been running at capacity to satisfy demand in china
8590312 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8590313 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8590314 we have not seen customers cancel orders to ask to postpone deliveries

8590317 ive seen war up close i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies who will respect our veterans when they get back home instead of letting them languish without the medical care they deserve
8590318 hillarys values are the values of my family and my community for hillary clinton no american is invisible
8590319 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8590320 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8590321 i was for hillary oh i was for hillary but barack obama beat her and when he won when he beat the woman i backed with all my heart and soul he proved to me that he was ready to be president

8590326 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8590327 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8590328 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8590329 i have chosen not to recommend the sugarloaf roadless area for wilderness designation even though it was included in the preferred alternative in the draft plan and eis
8590330 my decision is based on the need for fuels treatment in the area to protect the big bear community at the same time i believe the current back country character will be effectively maintained using the back country non motorized and back country motorized use restricted land use zones
8590331 the bears are looking for food obviously to fatten up for the winter and theyre going after picnic baskets
8590332 i think it was because we give him the freedom to write the books he wants to write whereas the london based publishers wanted him to write less humorous books also were better than the big london publishing companies at reaching his target markets in south east asia
8590333 we have several singaporean and malaysian authors for example awang goneng a malaysian journalist based in london who turned a blog about his childhood into a memoir growing up in trengganu
8590334 we use copy editors and designers in san francisco dublin london and perth
8590335 weve signed distribution agreements with a number of companies tuttle is our biggest partner they distribute us in the usa canada south america the uk europe south africa and the middle east we have other partners in australia new zealand and some of the asian markets
8590336 we have a freelance publicist here in singapore and wed consider using them elsewhere for example in london if we felt a title warranted it
8590337 sorting out distribution was a big problem but i think weve cracked that one now
8590338 we also face constant problems getting paid in some of our smaller markets getting money out of the philippines is an ongoing battle

8590358 het plan voor het internetportal choose italy werd vijf jaar geleden gelanceerd door de toenmalige regering van silvio berlusconi
8590359 het internetportal moest opgebouwd worden rond de website italia it berlusconi spiegelde zich daarbij aan succesvolle voorbeelden zoals www spain info dat in 2002 voor een kostprijs van 9 miljoen euro werd opgericht en vorig jaar 65 miljoen pageviews realiseerde de spaanse website met het espa a logo van joan mir hielp spanje om na frankrijk de tweede meest populairste toeristische bestemming te worden

8590372 we want to celebrate our areas history and build upon the rich heritage
8590373 we always have more calls and e mails from kids and parents interested in swimming after an olympics
8590374 but theres been a lot more than usual in the past couple of weeks probably because of phelps its the same with the other coaches ive talked to
8590375 its great to see more kids and families getting into the sport how many of them will stay with it is the big question
8590376 the question we always ask beginning swimmers and families is are they ready to make the time commitment
8590377 it doesnt matter if youre with a united states swimming affiliated club like us the dolphins or at one of the area y teams
8590378 you have to be ready to put in the time
8590379 august is usually the only down period we have during the year
8590380 our big meets are done for the season we begin to gear back up in september so its almost a year round activity
8590381 the goal of the raiders or other swim clubs is specifically to develop swimmers to the highest level of national and international competition
8590382 so the training is going to be very intense and the competition at meets very deep
8590383 ive worked for some ys and the emphasis is on overall family fun and fitness there are plenty of very competitive y programs right around here like beavercreek south dayton or countryside in lebanon you get to the nationals and there are y teams which are tougher than a lot of club teams
8590384 its a tough sport and lots of schools struggle to get a good size team or to even have a team

8590875 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8590876 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8590877 one would choose to enable pvp for the rush of not only having to defend against scary monsters lurking around corners but defend against scary players lurking around corners

8590881 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8590882 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8590883 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8590884 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8590885 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8590886 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8590887 even within our own church theres been debates about life you know from from summa theologica aquinas and 40 days to quickening and right to you know you know pius ix animated fetus doctrine and so on
8590888 and the decision that i have come to is roe v wade is as close to were going to be able to get as a society that incorporates the general lines of debate within christendom judaism and other faiths where it basically says there is a sliding scale relating to viability of a fetus
8590889 this is an amazing development bishop blake was crystal clear in condemning abortion there was nothing subtle about it he identified himself as a pro life democrat and blatantly challenged his partys historic position on abortion he also challenged barack obama to pursue his promise to reduce abortions and to ensure viable alternatives just this one moment is a significant turn for the democratic party
8590890 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8590891 every christian voter needs to see obama and biden for what they are the most strident supporters of child killing ever seen in a presidential race
8590892 abortion is murder and no faithful christian catholic or protestant can vote for obama its that simple
8590893 it was billed as the breakthrough moment the democratic national convention which prohibited gov
8590894 maybe thats the source of pelosis confusion she really doesnt understand the difference between the teaching authority of the catholic church and the dnc
8590895 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8590896 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition of when life begins
8590897 there are plenty of catholics living a life rife with sin that seek to justify their behavior by saying they disagree with the church on the source of their delinquency
8590898 maybe thats the source of pelosis confusion she really doesnt understand the difference between the teaching authority of the catholic church and the dnc
8590899 have the stage an attentive audience and a winning position
8590900 you dont get this it isnt simply that you need to be a more faithful husband wife you need to be a more faithful christian this isnt just about you and mary bob this is about you and jesus

8590909 our message took me through the closed doors of a senate subcommittee hearing to the open podium at the national press club and a range of other unique and inspiring experiences
8590910 despite a never ending to do list and the need to adapt to a constantly fluctuating global arena there was a sincere and pervasive dedication to the cause of bringing awareness and hopefully an end to the suffering of the people in darfur
8590911 i think it is important in todays global world and economy that the best and brightest young people such as carnegie mellon students have the opportunity to develop a solid understanding of the political process
8590912 these internships give the students a chance to see washington from the inside and cultivate the skills and connections they will need to have a real impact when they go out into the world
8590913 it is a very personal song its very in depth and emotional a real song that i know is going to connect with people
8590914 she has only just finished it but it could be rushed on to the new album there are reports on the internet claiming to have the tracklisting but so far only about seven songs are definite
8590915 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8590916 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8590917 everyone is subject to the law even web sites and blogs
8590918 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8590919 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent

8590928 mijn superieuren waren er niet blij mee de plaatselijke bisschop was er niet gelukkig mee maar ze hebben mij ook niet begrepen
8590929 de wedstrijd zou een manier zijn geweest om te laten zien dat niet alleen de schoonheid bestaat die we op de televisie zien maar dat er ook een meer verborgen charme is aldus de priester
8590930 we talked about some of the things we wanted to work on and we did a good job on those things
8590931 we wanted to work on our offense and we did we still have more to work on our hitters have to be more consistent and our blocking has to get better
8590932 we were very much improved from the imlay city tournament on saturday

8590942 we have studied this in mice but it has naturally been difficult to do so in humans now we have had an opportunity to examine such transplants in an individual with type 1 diabetes
8590943 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress
8590944 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8590945 social media gets all these ad impressions but not necessarily get the dollars
8590946 category by category year over year were up double digits
8590947 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8590948 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8590949 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8590950 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward
8590951 this new era of cervical cancer presents many opportunities and challenges ahead there is now realistic hope for controlling this disease where the toll is the highest and we have to seize this opportunity we in the cervical cancer community will be stepping up all our efforts to help developing countries get this disease under control
8590952 we feel ourselves as powerful as the sorcerers of old we put our magic horse to the carriage and space disappears we fly like clouds in a storm
8590953 hemos demostrado que tenemos nivel europeo en anfield road ahora tenemos que concentrarnos en el campeonato y la copa de la uefa

8590955 para nosotros es un partido muy importante y todos somos conscientes de ello
8590956 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8590957 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc

8590960 ich habe die frage nach dem beginn des menschlichen lebens als eifrige ihren glauben praktizierende katholikin ber lange zeit studiert
8590961 der heilige augustinus sagte da die beseelung nach drei monaten eintrete wir wissen es nicht
8590962 ich verstehe aber das ist erst seit vielleicht f nfzig jahren so in der kirchengeschichte wurde die frage kontrovers diskutiert
8590963 die gegenw rtige lehre der katholischen kirche ber das menschliche leben und ber die abtreibung ist die gleiche wie vor 2000 jahren
8590964 ich gehe davon aus da bidens integrit t ihn dazu f hren wird die heilige kommunion nicht zu empfangen wenn er ein falsches recht auf abtreibung unterst tzt
8590965 leider scheinen die kenntnis der kirchengeschichte und der kirchenlehre nicht eine davon zu sein
8590966 me duele que se creen dudas sobre lo que puedo aportar al equipo
8590967 tengo esa espina clavada llegu al valencia en un gran momento de forma con t tulos bajo el brazo era internacional con brasil hab a sido campe n del mundo y pens que podr a aportar muchas cosas a este equipo pero las lesiones provocan que la gente se olvide de todo eso y que se creen dudas
8590968 todo esto me duele porque yo s lo que puede hacer me siento muy bien y espero tener la posibilidad de jugar varios partidos seguidos ese es mi reto para esta temporada
8590969 me parece muy bien el esfuerzo que ha realizado el club con estos dos jugadores ya que como ellos hay pocos aportan muchas cosas goles y calidad y son los que marcan la diferencia
8590970 no soy yo quien ha de decidir sobre este tipo de cosas hay gente en el club que responder a mejor a esta pregunta
8590971 fue un palo duro pero hay que olvidar cuanto antes y empezar a vivir la liga
8590972 estamos motivados entrenamos con intensidad y creo que estamos en el buen camino

8590979 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8590980 this months report also highlights that as disposable incomes tighten food retailers fare better than the rest of the market
8590981 shoppers will continue to be forced to look around for the best value on offer for all their purchases not just their groceries
8590982 sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8590983 the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession
8590984 at least there was reassuring news from an inflation point of view with drops in both the reported and expected selling prices balances but even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months
8590985 indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year

8590999 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8591000 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8591001 apart from that my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8591002 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations

8591007 national preparedness month is an important reminder about each americans civic responsibility to prepare for emergencies
8591008 those with the capacity and wherewithal to help themselves must do so in advance so that in the event of an emergency responders can first assist those who are unable to tend to themselves
8591009 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8591010 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first
8591011 this is a pretty basic information form but one that gets both abused and ignored a lot of divorced parents arent even aware that it exists
8591012 they never really explain their situation fully to their preparer or they are still doing their own returns not knowing what this is
8591013 the father was current and claimed the children as dependents but the mother who was the custodial parent also claimed the children on her 1040 the mother had not provided the father with a signed form 8332 so he had attached a copy of the separation to his return
8591014 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
8591015 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8591016 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8591017 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8591018 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8591019 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8591020 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8591021 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8591022 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing
8591023 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8591024 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8591025 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8591026 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8591027 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8591028 a perfect accompaniment to an evening spent relaxing at home
8591029 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is under way against all 18 individuals
8591030 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8591031 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8591032 well make the same demands we have from the beginning that the company negotiates with us on enterprise agreements and to have the guts to inform us properly about the cuts
8591033 the last i heard there was no stop work activity
8591034 it is work as usual obviously we support the actions of the meaa we will continue to monitor the situation but at this stage things are proceeding normally
8591035 we can confirm that fairfax newspapers will be published tomorrow as normal
8591036 people are worried about their futures and if they are going to have a job in a few weeks time
8591037 they believe the new management team that has come in since the merger with rural press is all about low cost and low quality journalism

8591047 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8591048 i dont want to talk about sanctions myself ahead of time when the meeting itself has not taken place but we are working with our 26 partners at this moment
8591049 i say they will certainly be suggested certain countries have already asked that sanctions be imposed

8591077 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8591078 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8591079 after looking at all the evidence and considering mr edmunds advice i have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any person with an offence relating either to the fire or the tragic deaths of three people who were staying in the hotel at the time
8591080 we remain committed to investigate any information that comes to our notice
8591081 today especially our thoughts are with the families of peter and monica hughes and joan harper
8591082 they are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones but this will always be difficult without knowing exactly why this tragedy happened
8591083 it is still potentially going towards the oil assets of the us gulf but current forecasts are not showing it to be the mother of all hurricanes
8591084 we have been going at top speed up to now
8591085 it is sad we had hoped that more people would be buying our cars
8591086 but improving the quality of our cars is our utmost priority this kind of time can prove important
8591087 china mobile rose after reporting its earnings results at lunch time yesterday but maybe after the market closed investors crunched the numbers some analysts are now more cautious about its prospects
8591088 we have continued to cut costs and improve the responsiveness of our operations
8591089 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants while the travel trailer division also had a loss quarter its performance was improved over the prior year the housing group remained profitable despite the challenging environment in that industry
8591090 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8591091 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates considering the current business climate we are pleased with the turnout indicated for our rv national dealer meeting next week we will be showcasing our newest products with innovative floor plans and exciting decor packages although we expect dealers to remain cautious for the foreseeable future we are eager to demonstrate to them why fleetwood remains an excellent choice as their business partner going forward
8591092 we believe that once the excess inventory of site built housing begins to clear the prospects for manufactured housing should improve
8591093 also the housing bill recently passed by congress contains several positives for our industry which should continue to narrow the gap between site built and manufactured housing lending practices we expect the difficult environment to continue for at least a couple more quarters however as shipments continue to lag throughout the country particularly in the retirement states of california arizona and florida in the meantime our trendsetter modular division has substantially completed two military contracts at fort bliss and fort sill and is in advanced stages of negotiations for additional similar contracts we have received positive feedback on our involvement to date and we expect to continue to participate in the armys military housing renovation plans
8591094 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows for fleetwood through that same period
8591095 despite a modest but unavoidable build up of motor home chassis and finished goods inventories in the first quarter cash and marketable investments totaled 85 7 million at july 27 2008 with virtually no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
8591096 since then we have raised an additional 26 5 million from real estate financing a successful refinancing of the 5 debentures is the next step in our strategy to put fleetwood in a position of strength relative to current economic conditions and posture the company for an advantageous future we believe in the long term strength and viability of both our industries and look forward to continuing our participation as a leader in each as the markets recover
8591097 allen is an experienced cfo with an impressive background of working with both private and public companies and we are excited to have him join the management team
8591098 he is well equipped to provide strategic and functional leadership for the next phase of stewarts growth
8591099 max has provided exceptional leadership to this company and to our management we are very grateful for his dedicated service during the past 40 plus years
8591100 max has been an icon of integrity for stewart and we are fortunate that max will continue in assisting us through the important transition to a new cfo
8591101 i was quite incredulous at the thought that michael jackson on the eve of his 50th birthday was thinking of plagiarising burns and cashing in on the 250th anniversary next year
8591102 the idea of turning burnss tunes and songs which he carefully collected into show tunes just kind of grates a wee bit
8591103 i think it is great that anybody is trying to bring burns and his philosophy and his poetry to the forefront of peoples minds
8591104 but i think there are ways and means of doing it that dont actually make him look silly
8591105 there is myriad interpretations of burns and every man has his own interpretation
8591106 there are some beautiful songs in the settings burns himself chose and i think it would be sad to move away from some of that
8591107 karena itu jangan sampai alergi terhadap politik hadirnya puluhan partai politik parpol diharapkan menjadi wadah bagi para politisi yang jujur dan ikhlas mengabdi kepada rakyat
8591108 jadi kalau kita ingin merubah kehidupan ke arah yang lebih baik maka harus berani dan tidak alergi dengan politik karena politik tidak sekejam seperti yang kita bayangkan
8591109 saya mengharapkan gerindra menjadi partai yang bersih dan benar benar ingin mengabdi kepada rakyat indonesia dalam upaya memperbaiki kehidupan bangsa
8591110 partai yang hanya menjadi wadah untuk mencari keuntungan pribadi akan ditinggalkan dan dicemoohkan oleh rakyat apalagi rakyat saat ini tengah mengalami berbagai kesulitan di bidang ekonomi dan berharap parpol bisa menjadi harapan mengatasi hal tersebut

8591121 it was one of those times when it was very clear what was right and what was wrong

8591146 there were two players we identified we want to close the robinho deal and that will be the end of our transfer window
8591147 robinho is young so hes the right age and hes come from madrid so he understands what big club football is all about
8591148 robinho comes with real real desire and wants to be recognised as one of the best players in the world
8591149 we are gaining respect every year and the rest of europe see us as a real club a lot of that has been behind the scenes work were very influential in european football if you look at where we were five years ago it has been a meteoric rise it is about growing up and ultimately you win the champions league and that cements your position
8591150 i do think chelsea got value for money from shevchenko
8591151 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to remember we got deco for 8m and that looks to be the buy of the season you have got to counter these things and we are happy with where we are
8591152 i get fed up at estimated losses because its not right im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract what we pay is an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8591153 hes a very good player because of his unpredictable style
8591154 if you expect one thing he can change that in a second hes different but hes at real not here

8591161 restaurant gordon ramsay has had a very good innings eight years at the top and still maintains very high standards
8591162 in the end though it is hardly surprising that an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8591163 indeed the ramsay empires current performance and in particular the poor standard of the more recent openings raises questions as to its direction and its ability to maintain its reputation as an operator of the highest quality
8591164 it is the culmination of many years hard work from myself and my team and also comes at the perfect time as i will open my own restaurant
8591165 if he wants me never to get to the status i want

8591187 it is a dream to play in the ryder cup
8591188 theres so many connotations and so many things that could happen that if you got caught up thinking about it the golf would become almost a sideshow
8591189 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8591190 im friends with nicko mcbrain the drummer from iron maiden hes a legend i wanted to have stuff that helps the guys go crash bang wallop for half an hour dj spoony is doing the official music hes in charge of giving us some cool inspirational stuff
8591191 what sort of governing body allows junior cup fixtures to dictate over league games we are playing steel and sons cup one week cis cup the next then it will be the intermediate cup and we simply dont know when our next league game is happening
8591192 players naturally want to win cup games but my players are already asking when the next league fixture is coming we didnt want to enter the intermediate cup but you have to enter that if you want to play in the irish cup its very frustrating because we are now playing catch up and will have a load of games to get through that puts us under greater pressure to win promotion if i had my way we would only play in the league and irish cup
8591193 i didnt play much golf when i was in orlando while last week i had a few days in dublin and then i was up at portrush playing with my sports psychologist karl morris who came over and spent a bit of time with me
8591194 im really pleased to be back in competition but im also so delighted that im not on the ryder cup bubble and facing the anxiety of whether or not you are going to make the team
8591195 theres enough to focus on this week without having that added stress so i am very happy
8591196 ive worked very hard this year on trying to focus on my goals and planning my schedule properly
8591197 playing well at the right time is something you can never plan for but i really paced myself well this season
8591198 i played well at the correct times and secured my place on the team early
8591199 this gave me the cushion to take the last two weeks off and to come here this week and watch it all unfold while i concentrate on the tournament
8591200 it was just fabulous to see darren win because hes now put himself prime position and we are going to need guys like him on the team
8591201 the ryder cup is going to be an unbelievable experience and guys like darren and lee westwood are going to be so pivotal to the success of the side given that im one of four rookies currently in the team
8591202 thats why i am pulling for darren as one of the picks
8591203 i would love to tee it up in the fourballs or foursomes with darren as my partner
8591204 and ive been bouncing that possibility off him already it would be so fantastic
8591205 i dont feel pauls shown good enough form during the qualifying period whereas darrens won twice
8591206 if it was me i would pick darren and ian poulter
8591207 david villa and valencia will remain together for many years the best striker in europe is staying at valencia
8591208 it is a very happy day for me in the last month and a half lots of things have happened around me that i have not experienced before
8591209 i want to thank valencia for this gesture i am very grateful to this club for what they have given me and i hope to continue to give good performances
8591210 we needed to strengthen our defence and anton is a great signing hell bring quality and competition for places hopefully we can take him to another level here
8591211 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club
8591212 i do not think we have ever been closer than we are now
8591213 i am not trying to be awkward michael is a very special player he is very important to this club and my vision for it if other people do not share that it is their problem i know the kind of people you need at a football club you can wait a lifetime for people who can help take it forward and he is one my job is to manage the club and that is what i am trying to do
8591214 i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what the police officer was telling me
8591215 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered and will be examined over the coming days
8591216 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing as soon as the house is deemed to be safe a search will be carried out to establish if anybody was inside forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8591217 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8591218 media companies fit for the modern world need to be lean and agile
8591219 the current structure of industry is unsustainable in the long term
8591220 the law is looking increasingly outdated and i would expect a major test case in the next couple of years
8591221 the old firm games are the big fixtures of the season and i was happy to see it come so early
8591222 im looking forward to the game and hopefully i get the nod to play up front in it
8591223 im definitely looking forward to it there is no fear whatsoever as a rangers player you always look to the old firm games those are the games you want to win you want to play a part in and as a forward its a dream to score in them
8591224 its the game the fans look to so if im playing a part and its a positive result for us im sure they will look on it positively hopefully i can go out and change a few minds on the day
8591225 i dont think they rangers supporters have been bad at all there is obviously a special set of circumstances coming back here and i always knew there would be a few opposing it which is to be expected but the majority have been fantastic and the little bit of negative reaction hasnt hindered my performances
8591226 but i dont feel the pressure at all if the team is winning thats all i care about i dont care if i score goals or someone else scores goals i want to play a part in contributing to a successful team
8591227 im sure there will be the usual banter between fans but its not something thats going to affect him he is an experienced enough player to handle it
8591228 it can inspire i dont think theres any doubt about that
8591229 if you want to come and play football and you want to be involved in football these are the games that you want to be involved in the big matches
8591230 you cant say during the match that you enjoy it if you manage to get a good result then you do but if you dont its an end of the world sort of thing i think theyre games that players want to play in and any player worth his salt would want to play in
8591231 weve got a big squad here now and obviously that would alert people to the fact that one or two may leave before the transfer deadline but then again that would depend on teams coming in for them thats a situation well have to continue to monitor until the end of the week
8591232 were happy enough with the group weve got here at present but well just have to wait and see the transfer window is one of them that throws up a lot of surprises in the last week

8591234 with the cash generated from the sale of mergent and kinetic we can now buy back almost half of our outstanding bond issue reducing our debt and significantly lowering our interest expense burden
8591235 we continue to focus on streamlining our operations and implementing cost cutting measures to improve profitability and efficiency
8591236 we are pleased with the initial steps we have taken following our strategic review of the business we believe that the sale of mergent and kinetic and the repayment of debt will position us for improved financial flexibility and enable management to concentrate on the china market our core competency
8591237 our retail businesses in both canada and the u s led the way for us again this quarter delivering over 1 billion in combined net income
8591238 our strategy is delivering steady performance in tough market conditions while allowing us to continue investing in future growth
8591239 our td canada trust franchise achieved a record quarter in volume growth customer satisfaction levels and efficiency these very strong results were delivered while we continued to invest in the business opening 11 new branches and supporting our longer hours strategy

8591245 this was a tough quarter for our wholesale bank the mispricing that occurred is particularly disappointing and not consistent with our strong risk management culture were continuing to work on a thorough review of our risk practices across the organization to ensure we minimise the risk of this kind of thing happening again
8591246 looking forward td securities remains focused on producing high quality earnings and solidifying its position as a top three dealer in canada
8591247 our retail businesses on both sides of the border which again produced more than 90 of our earnings this quarter continued to perform very well providing td with a solid base of consistent earnings
8591248 in what continues to be a tough environment for banks were showing our strategy is working
8591249 our commitment to growth is reflected in the increase to our dividend weve said all along that our dividend will grow in line with our earnings over the medium term the increase this quarter demonstrates the boards confidence in the strength and stability of our earnings as we head into 2009
8591250 international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards a revised framework
8591251 the survey underlined that people have strong opinions on green issues and theres good evidence of green behaviour in the uk the danger is that we overestimate how good the state of the uks own environment is and become complacent in our efforts to become greener messages about some basic but effective actions for example recycling have been understood and we are willing to accommodate these in our lifestyles but with our negative view of the environment globally we should recognise our responsibility to do whatever we can and be open to a wider range of green behaviours in order to reduce our impact on the environment as much as possible
8591252 our solid second quarter operating results reflect the ongoing success of our merchandising strategies and excellent execution across the board from our team given our positive momentum strong positioning in the marketplace and easier comparisons which continue through the second half of the year we are optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year although we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment accordingly we have modestly raised our expectations for the balance of the year

8591280 sistem ekonomi yang dibangun lebih menguntungkan kalangan pengusaha dan hanya segelintir masyarakat yang menikmatinya
8591281 itulah salah satu penyebab kemiskinan dan kemelaratan yang melanda rakyat indonesia karena kapitalis sama sekali tidak peduli dengan rakyat
8591282 untuk itu gerindra bertekad menjadi wahana dan wadah politik baru yang menjadi harapan rakyat untuk membawa perubahan dan menentukan arah dan kebijakan ekonomi yang selama ini belum berpihak kepada rakyat kecil
8591283 kondisi tersebut harus disikapi dengan tidak memelihara pengusaha yang menganut bisnis kapitalis tetapi pengusaha yang memiliki jiwa nasionalisme yaitu bertekad membangun perekonomian bangsa sehingga dapat meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat

8591289 we as an airport are governed by national standards and we comply with them quite willingly to me its a bit of a non issue if local residents would like us to behave differently
8591290 if people ask the airport to do things over and above what the legislation requires it makes it difficult to know where to draw the line
8591291 the report should be with us any time soon and it will cover life expectancy energy efficiency and acoustic issues with single glazing and replacement costs

8591299 we continue to focus on controlling and reducing our operating expenses to the most efficient and effective level required to carry out our current and pending pipeline of projects for 09 and 10 while we have steadily reduced headcount the resultant savings take two to three quarters to show up in the p amp l we continue to shift our focus toward high margin projects with recurring revenues combined with commercial rollouts we believe our actions will pave a clear path to profitability for oti we continue to have a strong and healthy balance sheet with 110 million in total assets and 34 3 million in cash cash equivalents and short term investments

8591301 we still believe that 2008 will be a turning point for oti in terms of showing a clear path to profitability and will reflect revenue growth of about 10 over 2007 with most of the growth expected in the fourth quarter of the year
8591302 our presence in northern ireland will enhance competition choice and quality for the benefit of local shoppers
8591303 it represents a 40m investment by john lewis and is backed by robust research showing sprucefield to be the only location in northern ireland capable of supporting a full range john lewis department store and from which we can run a long term successful and viable business
8591304 as a business we look for opportunities to be involved with the communities in which we trade and sprucefield is no exception
8591305 we look forward to being part of the overall sprucefield development which will deliver landmark long term economic investment and job creation for northern ireland and hope that todays news will help get this valuable project back on track very quickly
8591306 this project has been subject to serious delay it is a scheme of regional significance in northern ireland and we believe that a public inquiry should be held as soon as possible so that the community and economy can benefit from the enhanced retail offer provided by the scheme
8591307 the involvement of john lewis shows huge confidence in the future of shopping in northern ireland
8591308 consumers should be encouraged that we continue to receive considerable interest from other leading retailers keen to open at sprucefield

8591346 the westlink is strategically a very important route and it was opened with great fanfare and welcome a few months ago and to find that in the first serious weather incident it is completely flooded out is a huge concern
8591347 roads service has confirmed it has appointed amey to carry out a full and thorough independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the flooding of the broadway underpass on august 16
8591348 amey are experienced consultants in the field of roads construction with expertise in design build finance and operate projects amey have not been involved in the design and construction of the westlink
8591349 issues that will be addressed include the weather conditions that are attributed to the flooding identification of the cause of the flooding response to flooding the design and construction of the underpass and potential mitigation in the future
8591350 discussions are ongoing with the roads service in relation to the timeframe and cost of the commission
8591351 amey is an experienced road construction consultant with expertise in design build finance and operate dbfo projects

8591355 i resigned as chairman of inverness caledonian thistle football club in may of this year and feel it only appropriate that all matters relating to the financial affairs of the club are answered by the club themselves
8591356 we dont disclose any specific information about individual players wages but im sure people will draw their own conclusions it would be foolish for us to say that marius transfer to the club was anything other than a significant investment and the money recouped from his transfer to dinamo bucharest will be reflected in next years figures
8591357 financially this club is in a very strong position and it would be completely wrong to assume from these figures that we were in any kind of difficulty
8591358 if the balance sheet is looked at in more detail that is more reflective of the clubs relative financial strength than the profit and loss account is on its own
8591359 the club has made a surplus equating to 490 000 in the previous two financial years and going forward we must ensure that our business model continues to be robust and sustainable for the longer term
8591360 all clubs must be mindful of their cost base in the current challenging environment and we are no different

8591422 how the catholic social principles of the universal destination of created goods and of solidarity are applicable in this kind of global village has become a major consideration

8591443 zoals de mensen die vroeger aanbaden in de tempel moeten ook christenen zeker zijn dat ze hun god aanbidden in overeenstemming met zijn openbaring van hoe hij is ze mogen dan misschien geen zichtbare afgod gemaakt hebben toch kan hun opvatting over hem onbijbels zijn mogelijk zien ze hem niet als gewoonweg rechtvaardig maar ook als streng niet simpelweg als liefdevol maar ook als sentimenteel zoals we zagen toont psalm 50 ons dat het mogelijk is om hem jahweh te noemen en toch over hem te denken alsof hij baal is de psalmen met hun godgerichte theologie zijn het meest effectieve antigif tegen verkeerd denken over god en kunnen op die manier effectief zijn in het hervormen van onze aanbidding

8591445 after naming his running mate senator joe biden our campaign believes senator obama will receive a bump in polling numbers after this weeks democratic convention in denver on thursday obama will give a great speech as has been his trademark the press will sing his praises and remark on his historic address and obamas place in history for example the associated press today published an article comparing the historic nature of the addresses a week before obamas speech this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls

8591458 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8591459 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8591460 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has lost one of its bravest and most admired activists
8591461 del martin dared for decades to fight to marry her beloved phyllis and by doing so became an iconic hero the lgbt community her death is a great loss to all of us but her life is an inspiration
8591462 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor
8591463 she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible when faced with moments of fatigue laziness or weakness one had only to ask what would del and phyllis do while she will be greatly missed her legacy will be cherished forever

8591471 has traced the origin of the funding of 9 11 back to financial accounts in pakistan where high ranking and well known al qaeda operatives played a major role in moving the money forward eventually into the hands of the hijackers located in the us
8591472 on the eve of the publication of its report the 9 11 commission was given a stunning document from pakistan claiming that pakistani intelligence officers knew in advance of the 9 11 attacks
8591473 pakistan gave tens of thousands of dollars through its lobbyists in the united states to members of the 9 11 inquiry commission to convince them to drop some anti pakistan findings in the report
8591474 pakistan has never indulged in the illegal activity of bribing or buying influence anywhere in the world
8591475 a possible isi role in the 9 11 plot remains unclear
8591476 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8591477 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8591478 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8591479 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8591480 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8591481 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8591482 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8591483 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8591484 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8591485 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8591486 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy

8591500 and youre not going to vote for him because hes black
8591501 after george bush has tattooed and beaten and battered you all over this country for eight years
8591502 this should be a no brainer this election its not
8591503 its not to get obama elected and joe biden were going to have to even fight with our own members fight with our members to do this

8591505 were going to turn this country around and in so doing turn ohio around
8591506 i dont think barack obama is going to have any problems in the 3 cs
8591507 where hes got to win where we have to help him win is in our area where hes not as strong as he would be otherwise
8591508 i cant guarantee you that we can get barack to win my district but were certainly going to reduce that margin as much as possible
8591509 were as united as a party as ive ever seen weve agreed its not about hillary clinton its about the families back home
8591510 felt that the proper thing for me to do was to set an example for the rest of the ohio delegation
8591511 i dont think that means any diminishing of commitment to work for and support barack obama
8591512 i think its just a desire on the part of some to make a statement about a historic happening in our country and in our party
8591513 were as united as a party as ive ever seen weve agreed its not about hillary clinton its about the families back home
8591514 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8591515 my fellow democrats 16 years ago we prevailed in a hard campaign in which republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8591516 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8591517 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8591518 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8591519 president clinton was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8591520 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country
8591521 you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt
8591522 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8591523 folks remember when the world trusted us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again

8591530 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8591531 were seeing the same kind of generational the same kind of societal change that john f kennedy represented in 1960
8591532 john f kennedy was a risky proposition as a nominee in 1960 we had never elected a catholic for president of the united states he was young was he experienced enough is he too glitzy a lot of the same things you hear about barack obama you heard about john f kennedy in 1960
8591533 they need to know hell fight for them a plain talking tough leader and that this isnt all about sitting around the campfire playing guitars
8591534 its not just what he says its how he says it
8591535 can tell you hes ready but hes got to show that
8591536 he has to give real specific stuff and he doesnt do specificity
8591537 americans want the answers to the economic problems they want lower gasoline prices and they want to know how youre going to get there if its just one of those rhetorical soaring speeches all people will remember is his standing there and saying nothing

8591584 vivo sola con il mio gatto un micione pigro che come unica particolarit degna di nota quando si indispettisce ha le zampe puzzolenti n lui n io facciamo molti sforzi per integrarci nella cerchia dei nostri simili siccome pur essendo sempre molto educata raramente sono gentile non mi amano tuttavia mi tollerano perch corrispondo fedelmente al paradigma della portinaia forgiato dal comune sentire di conseguenza rappresento uno dei molteplici ingranaggi che permettono il funzionamento di quella grande illusione universale secondo cui la vita ha un senso facile da decifrare
8591585 la mia famiglia frequenta tutte persone che hanno seguito lo stesso percorso una giovent passata a cercare di mettere a frutto la propria intelligenza a spremere come un limone i propri studi e ad assicurarsi una posizione al vertice e poi tutta una vita a chiedersi sbalorditi perch tali speranze siano sfociate in unesistenza cos vana la gente crede di inseguire le stelle e finisce come un pesce rosso in una boccia mi chiedo se non sarebbe pi semplice insegnare fin da subito ai bambini che la vita assurda questo toglierebbe allinfanzia alcuni momenti felici ma farebbe guadagnare un bel po di tempo alladulto
8591586 anche paragonata agli adulti sono molto pi furba della maggior parte di loro cos non ne vado particolarmente fiera perch non merito mio ma una cosa certa nella boccia non ci vado una decisione ben ponderata

8591600 it wasnt that long ago that the prime minister of new zealand said that she had standards for her cabinet that she issued warrants to people that had integrity
8591601 i mean i would have thought that is your basic minimum requirement that somebody in your cabinet you can trust and rely on their word
8591602 its all very well for the prime minister to say well its up to the privileges committee but the reality is thats actually not strictly correct its actually up to her whether she has the confidence of the ministers in her cabinet and in future cabinets
8591603 im saying helen clark has long since traded away her standards and integrity she expects from ministers
8591604 this is about the pure pursuit of power and its about the end justifying the means in her book
8591605 this is not the standard she had when she came into office in 1999 and is now the standard she holds if she wants to have a fourth term

8591623 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games they must release all imprisoned peaceful activists allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty
8591624 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way will anyone wonder after the games are over why the chinese government remains intransigent about human rights

8591654 it would be an extraordinary abuse of authority if you advised the president on this matter after learning that your own conduct was to be investigated
8591655 the decision by the president to shut down the opr investigation by denying security clearances to key department personnel was itself extremely unusual controversial and in our view improper but the issue of your role in advising the president on this question raises what may be even more serious concerns

8591659 i heard people screaming and swearing so i came outside he was lying on the ground on his back with his head on the side there was blood all on his face

8591669 predominantly white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments
8591670 whites at princeton it often seems as if to them i will always be black first
8591671 if those whites at princeton really saw michelle as one who always would be black first it seems that she gave them that impression
8591672 i hoped that these findings would help me conclude that despite the high degree of identification with whites as a result of the educational and occupational path that black princeton alumni follow the alumni would still maintain a certain level of identification with the black community however these findings do not support this possibility
8591673 a reader in the know informs me that michelle obamas thesis is unavailable until nov 5 2008 at the princeton library i wonder why

8591701 it is probably true that in general the higher the education of the individual becomes the more their views are differentiated if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and common taste prevail this does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards it is as it were the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people

8591763 it isnt easy to balance the needs of industry academics and basic research but thats what purdue has accomplished at herrick labs over the past 50 years
8591764 the labs have developed a formula for satisfying the practical requirements of industry without compromising the academic standards of purdues faculty and students
8591765 herrick labs is a place where students learn about industry relevant problems and contribute through their research to solving these problems
8591766 herrick graduates are valued for their technical expertise and know how for making products more efficient more environmentally friendly and more people friendly
8591767 herrick was ahead of its time because it started as an interdisciplinary collaboration when it wasnt fashionable to do so
8591768 an animal sciences professor and a mechanical engineering professor got together to study the effects of climate on animals
8591769 today of course interdisciplinary research and vital ties to industry are the foundation of purdues discovery park but herrick was really founded on the same principle many years ago
8591770 for example new concepts using theoretical modeling and advanced experimental techniques developed at the laboratories continue to have a great impact on the design of cars and trucks and equipment used in heating ventilating air conditioning refrigeration and other systems
8591771 the current buildings infrastructure and utilities currently limit the scope of research that we can do given the special purpose facilities needed for much of our research this is a challenging endeavor
8591772 the wide scope of the research conducted at the laboratories will require demanding specifications for the new building in particular the need for acoustic and vibration isolation in various parts of the building
8591773 some areas will require background noise and vibration levels to be below human perception thresholds and in these areas an ability to precisely control environmental parameters will be critical
8591774 this will involve reconfigurable heating ventilation and cooling systems and building envelopes so that new concepts can be tried out in a realistic setting
8591775 actual energy efficiency occupant comfort and productivity in a working building can be monitored and the information used to make refinements to proposed technologies
8591776 the overall concept behind the new herrick labs is to go beyond green learn through research how to further increase energy efficiency and lower environmental impact but also integrate occupant comfort and productivity into building design objectives so that you design spaces that people actually want to be in
8591777 the living lab is important because we want to be able to demonstrate that concepts work and identify where the problems are so that they can be addressed
8591778 if you are designing products that impact people it makes sense to study how people perceive factors such as sound vibration temperature lighting and other elements
8591779 then you can integrate human experience into the design of products
8591780 the new facility will enable us to study issues in a much more multimodal way so we could study sound and vibration together or vision and noise or we could look at productivity in a noisy hot and humid environment and examine tradeoffs between thermal and acoustic comfort or air quality we will look at the effects of the environment on the people working in them in terms of comfort productivity and health

8591790 profound orthodoxy that saw a risk a threat in the man called jesus
8591791 this explains the fact that he clearly persecuted the church of god he was on the road to damascus precisely in order to prevent the spread of this sect as he himself said
8591792 became a tireless apostle of the gospel and passed into history for what he did as a christian or rather as an apostle
8591793 is subdivided on the basis of the three missionary voyages to which is added a fourth when he was taken to rome as a prisoner
8591794 in the ancient cultural capital he preached to the pagans and greeks in the agora he gave a model speech for explaining to the greeks that this god is not foreign and unknown but one they had been waiting for the deepest response to their anticipation
8591795 dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without holding anything back
8591796 can be explained only by a soul that is enraptured with the light of christ
8591797 it is truly necessary to proclaim the light of christ to the world to give a glimpse of the beauty and necessity of the gospel for all of us
8591798 that the lord may show his light to us as well and that we may also give the world the light of the gospel the truth of christ
8591799 the un secretary general stated the obvious which is that there is only one mandate for mr nimetz to discuss the matter of the name any country that wishes to maintain something different may be heard but that does not mean that we share their opinion

8591806 i go down to watch each night i have a drink on the main street with all the bars and im learning english by being surrounded by the young girls
8591807 the other day a british tourist walked through a shop window because he thought it was his hotel now hes in hospital youll never believe some of the things that happen here they are hilarious i love it
8591808 i was speaking to the other village women and we all agreed in malia you can make money but the price is that you lose your children
8591809 british standards include consuming alcohol to the point of fainting women having one night stands that they do not remember the next morning and casual quarrels that can lead to fights
8591810 the aim of the roadmap is to ensure tourists still have fun but avoid the hazards associated with excessive drinking
8591811 the greek police helped us with our publicity campaign tour operators signed up to take more control over pub crawls and local mayors agreed to better control the quality of alcohol sold to young tourists
8591812 our close work with the greek authorities in tourist resorts has only further strengthened and deepened our partnership with greece

8591840 five years ago in baghdad a suicide bomber in a flatbed truck pulled up outside the lightly fortified office of the united nationss leading diplomat sergio vieira de mello and detonated a cone shaped bomb the size of a large man the bomb was laced with hand grenades and mortars and it carried more than a thousand pounds of explosives its force was so fierce that it shook the american controlled green zone three miles away while many united nations officials were killed instantly mr vieira de mello was not for more than three hours he lay trapped beneath the collapsed roof and floors of the three story building as he asked about the fates of his colleagues and complained about the pain in his legs although the bush administration had not equipped american forces to respond to large scale terrorist attacks on civilian targets several soldiers heroically risked their lives to save him submerging themselves in the sweltering crumbling wreckage but without proper equipment they were forced to rely on their hands and helmets along with a makeshift pulley system constructed out of a womans straw handbag and an office curtain rope mr vieira de mello died as did 21 other people from 11 countries among the dead were experts in conflict resolution humanitarian assistance and development work more than 150 people were severely injured survivors of the attack and devastated colleagues branded the day the united nationss 9 11
8591841 the individuals who carry out vital humanitarian and development work for the united nations and nongovernmental organizations have never been more at risk
8591842 the baghdad bombing made it clear that the united nations and humanitarian groups had moved from the 1990s when their flags no longer offered them protection to a phase in which their affiliations made them outright targets of al qaeda and other violent extremists al qaeda and other groups have said that the united nations is a priority target in november 2001 osama bin laden declared under no circumstances should any muslim or sane person resort to the united nations the united nations is nothing but a tool of crime last year al qaeda specifically denounced the humanitarian agencies of the united nations as direct enemies aiming to change the fabric of muslim society united nations officials have recently received specific threats in afghanistan algeria iraq lebanon somalia and sudan in december a qaeda suicide strike in algeria killed 17 united nations workers and injured another 40 the after action report on the algeria attack sounded helpless the u n is under an extremist threat the threat could be carried out anywhere at any time there is no u n capacity to predict attacks mr vieira de mellos political team had come to iraq in 2003 in order to hasten the end of the american occupation but this proved to matter little to a man known as abu omar al kurdi who helped al qaeda plan the attack a lot of islamic countries have been through injustices and various occupations and foreign troops using the u n resolutions he said afterward referring to the resolutions of the united nations security council by this logic the 140 000 unarmed civilian personnel who do political humanitarian development and human rights work for the united nations would be blamed for the security councils actions and inactions over which these civil servants have little say
8591843 the killing of the aid workers in afghanistan showed how aid groups are being lumped with western governments and military forces in claiming responsibility for the attack the taliban posted a statement on the internet saying it held the three western women responsible for natos killing of 50 civilians in a wedding party in july united nations officials and aid workers who choose to work in conflict zones have always exposed themselves to banditry crime and violence but the assaults kidnappings and killings of humanitarians have more than doubled in the past five years precisely when independent humanitarian reconstruction and development assistance has been urgently needed in places like afghanistan and iraq
8591844 first in some places where local authorities are unable to prevent al qaeda and other violent extremists from operating the united nations and other aid organizations may have no choice but to reduce their physical presence
8591845 second the 192 countries that are part of the united nations must spend substantially more money on security for the organizations missions
8591846 and finally while many global terrorist networks cannot be deterred their plans can be thwarted when international organizations and aid groups get the cooperation of their host countries often the safety of unarmed humanitarians will be determined by whether a host country will deny sanctuary to militants share intelligence with humanitarian groups or offer protection to their facilities when the host country ignores requests for high level security assistance as algeria did last year the united nations should be prepared to suspend its programs or to withdraw altogether in collapsed states where the host government has only partial control of its territory that host still has a duty to share what information it has and to be explicit about the gaps in its knowledge and when united nations mandated international security forces are sent the worlds governments must contribute the troops equipment and intelligence they need to deliver professional service

8591860 i was quite incredulous at the thought that michael jackson on the eve of his 50th birthday was thinking of plagiarising burns and cashing in on the 250th anniversary next year
8591861 the idea of turning burnss tunes and songs which he carefully collected into show tunes just kind of grates a wee bit
8591862 i think it is great that anybody is trying to bring burns and his philosophy and his poetry to the forefront of peoples minds
8591863 but i think there are ways and means of doing it that dont actually make him look silly
8591864 there is myriad interpretations of burns and every man has his own interpretation
8591865 there are some beautiful songs in the settings burns himself chose and i think it would be sad to move away from some of that

8591876 hm needs 2 800 machine parts to manufacture a car many trucks carrying these machine parts are held up in durgapur and asansol areas we will keep two of our business units closed tomorrow we hope the durgapur expressway will be open to traffic soon
8591877 we will put up road blocks across the state for two hours from 3pm on friday this is our way of protesting against the governments refusal to return 400 acres to farmers
8591878 the entire state should know what sort of suffering the unwilling farmers of singur are being put through by the state government
8591879 either nano rolls out and agriculture stays or nano stops rolling but agriculture stays
8591880 i have pointed out that i am ready for talks provided 400 acres are returned to the unwilling farmers
8591881 we are ready to give a package to those who have no livelihood

8591895 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes this was a pretty surprising finding

8591915 after looking at all the evidence and considering mr edmunds advice i have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any person with an offence relating either to the fire or the tragic deaths of three people who were staying in the hotel at the time
8591916 we remain committed to investigate any information that comes to our notice
8591917 today especially our thoughts are with the families of peter and monica hughes and joan harper
8591918 they are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones but this will always be difficult without knowing exactly why this tragedy happened
8591919 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8591920 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8591921 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8591922 yes we are in constant touch with both sri lanka and south africa and the chances are that the triangular series will be played next month

8591926 all of us have seen in the news the frequent reports of young people killing strangers in the street killing fathers defending their property killing people with learning difficulties killing other young people who are different to them
8591927 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed five million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
8591928 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
8591929 this is a substantial breakthrough in maternal fetal medicine that could positively impact the health of thousands of babies
8591930 after 10 years of studying the effects of magnesium sulfate it has proven to be a successful method of reducing the outcome of cerebral palsy in premature births
8591931 based on results of the study in the future it is possible that women at risk of prematurely giving birth could proactively receive magnesium sulfate to reduce their childs chances of developing cerebral palsy
8591932 with additional research it is possible that in the next few years this will be a standard of care

8591940 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
8591941 the formation of lewy bodies is a key event in the development of nerve cell death associated with parkinsons disease understanding how these are formed will help us to figure out what happens when nerve cells die in parkinsons and from this to develop therapies that will ultimately provide a cure for the condition

8591944 it may have been a church full of pedophiles and criminals covering up other criminals sins it may have been a church riddled with hypocrisy deceit and corruption but our megachurch experience taught us that we were captive catholics
8591945 the eucharist and the presence of the body and blood of christ is in my mind an overwhelming experience for me i find that communion for me is empowering its almost a feeling of a kind of high
8591946 i find it mind boggling that with nearly 70 percent of americans describing themselves as christians and witnessing the success of the passion of the christ and the chronicles of narnia that hollywood still doesnt do the kinds of faith based and family value entertainment that people are desperate to see

8591992 i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them
8591993 winston peters would be unacceptable as a minister in a government led by me unless mr peters can provide an acceptable explanation for the owen glen saga
8591994 it wasnt that long ago that the prime minister of new zealand said that she had standards for her cabinet that she issued warrants to people that had integrity
8591995 i mean i would have thought that is your basic minimum requirement that somebody in your cabinet you can trust and rely on their word
8591996 its all very well for the prime minister to say well its up to the privileges committee but the reality is thats actually not strictly correct its actually up to her whether she has the confidence of the ministers in her cabinet and in future cabinets
8591997 im saying helen clark has long since traded away her standards and integrity she expects from ministers
8591998 this is about the pure pursuit of power and its about the end justifying the means in her book
8591999 this is not the standard she had when she came into office in 1999 and is now the standard she holds if she wants to have a fourth term

8592018 gt mike bliss poses in his greece home last friday five months after he was attacked and left paralyzed in buffalo hes slowly regaining the use of his body
8592019 we keep hoping because little things keep coming back and we work very hard
8592020 we work hard with him were not going to give up
8592021 it was really scary because there were a few times where i thought we might lose him
8592022 i wasnt really thinking about if he would walk again i was thinking about if he would live
8592023 we dont want to ever look back and say we didnt do enough
8592024 it keeps me optimistic in hopes of getting out of my wheelchair
8592025 its going to take awhile but its still what im shooting for
8592026 its sad when he gets sad but in a way im glad to see him release it
8592027 its just a massive increase in one day i dont think we can cope with that it would mean laying someone off
8592028 i wouldnt have thought the council could turn round and say weve not increased our rents in seven years so we are going to do it all in one day its a particularly numb feeling at the moment its almost a position of being bullied
8592029 if it was phased in over say three years we could look at other ways of absorbing the cost
8592030 we have been here since 2002 and our rents havent increased in that time we expect gradual increases but it has almost doubled from 288 to 488 a month
8592031 its a lot of money especially for a small business and especially in the current climate its not as if business is booming and were not going to notice it
8592032 a lot of people wont be able to afford that i dont know what to do
8592033 before the council had responsibility for maintaining the outside of the building now we are having to do this theyre upping our rent and making us do all that it does seem a bit unfair
8592034 it is a big increase its a bit of a shock everyone is in the same situation but i think we will just have to bite the bullet
8592035 rent reviews are based on what a property could achieve in rent if it was put on the open market at the time of a review
8592036 based on the evidence from new open market lettings in the peffer business centre in april 2008 we have subsequently proposed rents in line with current market conditions
8592037 if any business can provide evidence to support a lower market rent then we would be happy to consider that information
8592038 there is no requirement for him to surrender his passport should he choose to travel abroad with another club
8592039 he is a jambo and always has been his mates went to the hibs game so paul decided to just sit in the pub and catch up with them after the game
8592040 when he met them later he got caught up in a fight at falkirk station which ultimately led to his banning order
8592041 the caltongate plans should have been refused by this council at the first opportunity
8592042 the biggest concern is the effect this will have on the citys world heritage status yet i was told at the last meeting on this subject that it was scaremongering to suggest that this development could cost us that
8592043 if we feel we need modern developments in a gap site we will take the decision
8592044 it would be illogical to stop a development that we have carefully considered
8592045 im not surprised although i had hoped they might consider it in a bit more detail we will now be urging ministers to order a full public inquiry
8592046 caltongate offers a once in a generation opportunity to significantly improve the fabric and feature of edinburghs old town
8592047 i myself would not anticipate sanctions being imposed while the meeting has not yet taken place

8592050 moscow alleges that atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
8592051 russia would be well advised to allow for example the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce the possibility to investigate
8592052 appalled by those in the west and russia who seem to want a return to cynical realities of the cold war
8592053 i am horrified by the forgetting of history and i do not understand what is driving some people to make frivolous comparisons with historical situations such as munich 1938 or sarajevo 1914
8592054 kosovo is and remains a special case in international law that cannot and should not be misused as a model

8592058 now thats done sharif is showing his true colours he resigned from the governing coalition on monday in protest over the treatment of judges fired by musharraf last year
8592059 sharif is in effect setting himself up as a political martyr for democracy the ppp is worried most about the restoration of one judge iftikhar chaudhry
8592060 the ppp government could not do anything in this regard
8592061 i went downstairs and opened the living room door and was confronted by the living room on fire i closed the door and shouted upstairs to the rest of the family to get out
8592062 i didnt realise they were trying to leave upstairs but they were restrained by the flames at the top of the window they came downstairs and got out the front door
8592063 i was using a cushion i couldnt put the fire out so i crawled through to the kitchen soaked a towel and came back and managed to put out the flames
8592064 after everything had calmed down and we were all outside safely we realised there had been a petrol bomb put through the window
8592065 as soon as i saw the re run of the television evidence i knew exactly who it was it was andrew brown
8592066 edinburgh city centre is the jam in our doughnut but the doughnut is getting bigger developments such as the gyle fort kinnaird ocean terminal and straiton have damaged the city centre
8592067 to allow the city to reclaim its place at the head of local retail means we must forego further developments on the periphery
8592068 this kind of development is long overdue in leith particularly the affordable housing which is doubly welcome
8592069 the security and breadth of our business positions us well for more challenging economic conditions
8592070 we remain confident of further planning progress within our property portfolio as we develop long term value in our property business
8592071 it was one of the most memorable experiences of my whole life
8592072 i got quite emotional actually looking off the front of the bus down the royal mile and seeing people all the way down
8592073 id love to say thank you to everybody who turned out and let them know how much it means to me
8592074 you have to pinch yourself the surreal thing is that all ive done is win a bike race its what i do its my job ive won things before and no one knows about it you do the same thing again and you get back home and the whole world knows about it
8592075 like every other parent im obviously proud as punch i could win a gold medal as the proudest mum the highlight of the past few weeks has just been seeing our son achieve his dreams
8592076 were looking forward to the next few months weve got family parties and various receptions coming up
8592077 from a very early age chris was always very determined to do the best he could and hes just carried that through it was lovely to be part of that it was my hobby taking him to places and it was his hobby to ride the bike so its been a good family business
8592078 im ecstatic its fantastic im so proud of him and of them all its fantastic turnout far more people than i would have expected
8592079 a few years ago i got a phonecall saying youve been fantastic were entering you for edinburghs sports personality of the year and i said dont bother i wouldnt even win it for my street
8592080 edinburgh has come out in force for chris hoy and scotlands athletes it has been a staggering success and everyone who came out today had a fantastic time
8592081 the huge turnout at the royal mile is a sign of how proud edinburgh people are of our athletes and of the massive impact that chris hoy has made on the global stage
8592082 there are just so many people who have been through there and now theyre sportsmen and champions to waste it now after all that work is dreadful really they deserve everything its lovely to have a nice turnout and for everybody to be so happy and proud
8592083 having gone by taxi when he was an ordinary msp and by car and plane after he became first minister it now turns out one of his only two train journeys was in the united states
8592084 we are constantly being urged to use public transport but the first minister is not setting a good example he probably has one of the biggest carbon footprints in scotland
8592085 this years event marks a step change for the melas entry into edinburghs festival calendar it is the boldest programme we have ever presented and has extended across many more cultures than previously
8592086 the mela this year offers a world of creative talent traditional indian dance will sit beside tango and flamenco troupes
8592087 the big top will host an aerial circus act and the rhythms of india and pakistan will be joined by those from japan africa and elsewhere upswing aerial have devised a breathtaking display of circus acrobatics and the london community gospel choir will add their infectious singing to the party atmosphere
8592088 we have tried to determine to what extent place matters
8592089 happiness is particularly difficult for a scientist to measure theres a lot of lively debate on what is the most appropriate measure
8592090 this is the first time in britain at least that there has been an attempt to take geography into account
8592091 the difference between areas is very small a lot of the difference is down to the make up of the people living there not just the area
8592092 it means people are less happy than we would expect them to be maybe miserable would be the right word
8592093 this is very surprising it is certainly not a description of edinburgh i recognise
8592094 i am not originally from edinburgh i came to the city 15 years ago and i have always found it to be a lively and vibrant place to live and work in i was at an event for the mela last night and what this research is saying does not square with what was going on there
8592095 the price for the titians is extraordinarily advantageous for us weve really got a lot of time
8592096 residents who are being plagued with noise from their neighbours loud parties or late night diy need not suffer through it
8592097 we have a well publicised popular service which people know they can turn to when faced with noise problems like these
8592098 the council in the past has tried to put noise levellers in which cut the electricity supply to the socket which the pa system is plugged into if it exceeds a certain level
8592099 this isnt the best way of doing things as they tend to respond more sensitively to tones rather than actual noise
8592100 the council does have a night noise team and perhaps people are more comfortable calling them when in the past they would have knocked on the neighbours door and asked if they would mind turning the music down a bit
8592101 we had such a fantastic day with the army and were really overwhelmed with their kindness craig has had a hard time over the last few years and to get a gift like this made his dreams come true
8592102 he has always wanted to be a soldier he has read all the books seen all the films and even has some of the kit
8592103 we were really welcomed in as friends and were surprised how much effort was put into giving craig a great birthday
8592104 we are always keen to help anyone who has an interest in the army especially if they are youngsters and it has been a lifelong one
8592105 the royal highland fusiliers who are based at glencorse are out fighting battles every day but it is nothing compared to the battle this young man has fought
8592106 we are starting to see more of a buyers market develop with the average premium now at 17 per cent ten per cent lower than last year we expect that to start to translate into a fall in average prices
8592107 if we continue to see what has been seen recently we would certainly expect the average price to come down there have been a lot more fixed prices and more sales below fixed prices
8592108 sellers are now accepting that the market has changed for a long time that did not happen that will have an impact on the prices they are expecting
8592109 the fall in the number of houses being sold is down to the unprecedented situation on liquidity people have also put properties on the market and seen them stall because they have unrealistic expectations
8592110 i dont believe we have a long term problem like america where there are too many properties because there is still more demand than supply in some areas
8592111 if someone came to me with a new build bought last year id say youll probably be deflated because the price is down considerably but if it is a good property in trinity or a family home they are still selling fairly well
8592112 the difficulty with these statistics is that they hide a lot of factors what we have seen is a very different market where the higher value properties are much easier to sell
8592113 the majority of these mid top end buyers have probably already built up a lot of equity and will not look at properties that require as big a mortgage as the lower end

8592120 if you allow the tax cuts to expire then you end up with a large tax increase

8592122 the child tax credit would be rolled back from 1 000 to 500

8592165 this investigation has been a complex and detailed one and i have taken advice from leading counsel concerning four individuals who have been on police bail awaiting a decision from the cps
8592166 i have decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any person with an offence relating either to the fire or the tragic deaths of three people who were staying in the hotel at the time
8592167 the effect of the decision means that the four people have all been released from police bail however it has been made clear to them and their legal representatives that the matter will be re considered by the cps should any fresh evidence come to light in the future

8592170 what was proposed was that in our low season or down time that we could out of compassion help out some of the sailboats but the houseboats no we are not built and cannot handle houseboats
8592171 what was addressed was the sailboats the way our moorage is built and our breakwaters are done we cant handle houseboats
8592172 theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
8592173 in the course of making this decision i thought long and hard about what i brought and what i did not bring to the mayors office i took into consideration my family the many people that have supported me those that have encouraged me and those that asked me to continue to represent the citizens of this community
8592174 as i consider the positives regarding a second term as mayor i find 28 000 reasons to continue that being said when i consider my family i find many reasons to return to nursing
8592175 given that the position of councillor would allow me to continue to represent people on the westside apply the knowledge that i have gained over the past year and at the same time allow me to return to a part time position at kgh i feel that this would be the best way to balance the needs of my family and those of the 28 000 people on the westside

8592178 der datenklau war m glich weil die betroffenen auf anderen internetseiten wie foren und dating angeboten dieselben usernamen und passw rter benutzten wie bei bezahlsystemen die nat rlich sch tzenswerte informationen beinhalten dort wurden die daten dann abgefischt
8592179 that wasnt my field i soon found out and because i liked cars so much decided this wasnt a bad profession either there were a bunch of us in salmon arm that liked the automobile business and a local businessman in the city saw what i could do without training and made me an offer that i would come to work for him and he would train me in the business i quickly jumped on the chance to see where it would go and whether i would like this as professional and business i wasnt all that sure i wanted to make the move for my future in this direction but decided to stick it out and it was a good career decision my dad was a heavy duty mechanic so i had that for a background the natural aptitude was there
8592180 i graduated from salmon arm high school and went to work in the shop where my dad worked in the parts department shipping and receiving then i decided to go traveling for a year when i was doing that job in the parts department i was most interested in how the place ran as a business when i came back from my year of travel i decided i was going to take the business program at ouc at that point it didnt matter what business it was going to be i just knew i wanted to get involved in something i had a mentor in salmon arm that helped me to get an inside look at the business world before i was finished school the opportunity to take over the auto body shop where todd worked in kelowna became available we worked out the details of what it would take to buy the shop and six months later we started in september 2003
8592181 we took over rudys body shop and in march 2004 and we renamed the business prestige collision we just didnt have enough room at rudys as you know it was a small operation for things like parking so we started to look the following year we had a couple of deals fall through before we found this space on kirschner road we put our offer in and it was accepted in june 2007
8592182 on part of the project we hired a general contractor because of our lack of expertise in this area even in the family there was no construction experience the contractor built the body shop and we tackled the strip commercial centre
8592183 in our first shop we hired a couple of people that were older than us but they didnt fit into our way of thinking about the future stuck in their ways probably describes it best were stubborn and very precise about the way we want things done with the customer front and centre all the time because we started this new shop we wanted harmony from the get go and hiring the young technicians has been the best thing that we could have done and the work they produce is outstanding it is great to have people on staff that actually care if the customer comes back in the future were trying to create a culture that you will feel when you come into the building where people will see the work that is being done by a crew who will care about the finished product it makes for a good place to work everyone on staff is part of what we are trying to accomplish here the last eight months in the old building were super stressful we were so tight on space and it was difficult for everyone but they saw what our plans were for this new location and they wanted to be a part of the expansion and the future we are four times the size now that we were back then our specialty is collision repair thats what we fix we dont really restore cars or do complete paint jobs our specialty would be making your car look as good or better than before it was in an accident
8592184 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
8592185 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
8592186 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
8592187 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8592189 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8592190 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world
8592191 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for
8592192 since ive never been called a man of few words let me say this as simply as i can yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next president of the united states of america barack obama
8592193 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready im ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time

8592224 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
8592225 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8592226 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
8592227 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
8592228 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
8592229 furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections
8592230 the alabama department of public health urges persons to use caution when coming into contact with these waters
8592231 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
8592232 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
8592233 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
8592234 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
8592235 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
8592236 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide

8592254 university hospitals case medical center is dedicated to making our care for heart disease and stroke patients among the best in the country we will continue in our efforts to build off the success achieved with continued implementation of this valuable program

8592266 scivee has been very successful in its goal to build a community around a particular area of research thereby creating a free flow of ideas across generations as well as different professional levels
8592267 what genes do you have to turn on for the cell to become a beta cell
8592268 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8592269 indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta cells in size shape and ultrastructure
8592270 this study provides an example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult organ and suggests a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state
8592271 in vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta cells
8592272 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
8592273 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
8592274 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
8592275 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
8592276 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

8592279 familial hypercholesterolaemia is a serious often undiagnosed but relatively common condition which if treated early will not affect normal life expectancy for the majority of people with the condition this guideline will improve healthcare professionals understanding of inherited high cholesterol and encourage them to actively ask people about their family history of cardiovascular disease so that all individuals with the condition are identified by offering treatment as soon as possible unnecessary and untimely deaths will be prevented
8592280 by pulling together the best available evidence and advances in technology with professional and patient expertise this guideline provides the nhs with a pragmatic and effective blueprint for reducing tens of thousands of deaths from premature heart disease only a fraction of people with fh in the uk are identified and the majority of people will remain unaware of their condition and untreated often with tragic consequences at the moment we know that without treatment 50 of men with untreated fh will suffer a heart attack by the age of 50 and 30 of women with untreated fh will suffer a heart attack by the age of 60 once an individual is diagnosed with fh the condition can be managed usually with a statin to help them reach normal life expectancy
8592281 these recommendations mean that patients throughout the country will benefit from a consistent and coherent approach to the management and treatment of their condition for example all individuals will be referred to a specialist with expertise in fh to receive a confirmation of their diagnosis and advice on appropriate treatment by bringing together everything we know about the diagnosis and management of fh healthcare professionals will be best placed to offer individuals and their families the highest standard of care that they deserve
8592282 we know that 15 000 people in the uk have already been identified with fh and we are now looking to identify further individuals with the condition so that they can be offered treatment the good news is that when individuals are identified with fh they can get the treatment they require and their family members can be offered a genetic or cholesterol test to see if they have inherited it whilst this guideline recommends individuals are offered a genetic test to confirm the diagnosis and help trace other family members the decision on whether to go through with this test should be taken by the individual based upon receiving the best available information from their doctor
8592283 as a nurse i know that this guideline will really benefit nurses and doctors involved in detecting and managing fh hopefully this guideline will create greater awareness for the condition in the healthcare profession and in members of the public so that more people will come forward to get a firm diagnosis and be confident that they have support in managing their condition
8592284 early identification of fh means that individuals diagnosed with the condition can be prescribed the right medication and advised and empowered on how to make changes to their lifestyle my father died after a heart attack at the age of 51 when i was 12 i was diagnosed with fh around 14 years ago and i know that by taking the medication exercising regularly eating and drinking sensibly not smoking and attending annual check ups my prognosis is excellent i was given the chance to take control of my life unlike my father i would strongly encourage anyone with a family history of early death from a heart attack or heart disease to have their cholesterol levels tested this would significantly lower the risk of serious illness or death from heart disease

8592290 porque espa a es un referente en competiciones del motor ya que organizamos tres grandes premios de motociclismo dos de f1 tenemos a pilotos punteros tenemos patrocinadores y una gran afici n
8592291 los grandes eventos que se celebran en la comunitat valenciana son indispensables para el sector tur stico valenciano ya que se suman al amplio cat logo de atractivos que ofrece nuestro territorio a sus visitantes vale la pena que veamos las preocupaciones del futuro con la capacidad de poner en marcha tareas complejas como hemos hecho durante estos meses y durante estos a os y como demostraci n palpable el gran premio de f1
8592292 el valencia street circuit es un ejemplo de un reto hecho realidad cinco millones de valencianos nos hemos empe ado en ser los mejores ya que cualquier objetivo que nos propongamos lo hacemos realidad con una capacidad de organizaci n de trabajo y esfuerzo como ning n otro territorio es capaz de hacer gracias por tanto por hacer posible esta gran meta que es escal n para futuras ambiciones los valencianos somos capaces de cosas incre bles

8592297 we all know it wasnt something that happened twenty years ago
8592298 we as a nation have got to ask ourselves what the hell is going on
8592299 rainbows are visions theyre only illusions and rainbows have nothing to hide
8592300 so weve been told and some choose to believe it but i know theyre wrong wait and see
8592301 wed have seen about 1000 mangy cats staring back at us through the windows and a reflection of miss rainbow brite the conspiracy theorist extraordinaire wearing a huge flowery muu muu and fuzzy pink carpet slippers and tammy faye bakker makeup
8592302 hear those sirens in the background thats the little men in white coats coming for her
8592303 why not qualify ahly is a big team and with a big history we might have had bad luck in some recent matches we played especially in the national competition but this doesnt mean that we are not capable of topping the group and even reach the final
8592304 in the second match against dynamos we didnt play well and we almost lost the match especially when they levelled the score it was a critical time but then the players pulled themselves back realised the danger and aboutrika clinched the winning goal with seconds to go for the match
8592305 i think well be facing more challenge from african teams in this competition everybody wants to beat ahly the teams are so ambitious now and have started playing very well against us as we have seen with dynamos
8592306 they were in their best form and we were down as a result from losing to masri 2 0 in the national league competition days before the match despite opening the score early in the game they were still disorganised
8592307 but ahly will face these teams to claim the title its our reputation we need to defend we will be cautious and very careful and have started preparing seriously because im sure the coming matches will be tougher we will not afford to make fatal mistakes because they might cause us a semi final berth which we dont want
8592308 hes a good goalkeeper but he still needs time to reach his peak people should be patient and give him the chance to prove that he deserves to be ahlys no 1 goalkeeper
8592309 lets not forget that he was the second goalkeeper for eight years and in the last years he rarely touched the ball except in training i believe he should be given a full chance
8592310 he committed mistakes and he realises that and i think he should work on correcting them because at a certain stage it will be hard to remain patient and i might have no other option but to replace him especially as we go deeper in the champions league and there would be no place for mistakes
8592311 there are two good goalkeepers and waiting to prove themselves as soon as they are summoned to step in
8592312 im still on a two year contract with ahly and i want to respect and honour my deal with them im looking forward for more titles with al ahly and build a powerful team we have many good star players young and old and i want to make a great squad out of them
8592313 if i succeeded in the coming two years and all went well as i plan i might renew for another two years
8592314 we have to win at all costs this time and considering our performance against al ahly in cairo we have every chance to win it it is very important that we learn to keep a clean sheet in this competition and we also have to put away the chances that come our way
8592315 we have to grow up and learn to take the initiative in these matches we cannot always be fighting from behind so we need to be very tough defensively because last year our success was built on our strong ability to defend as a team
8592316 if you look at our statistics last year we didnt give away too many goals so if we can improve on our concentration defensively i am sure we will win more matches because i know that going forward we are good enough and we can get a goal or two
8592317 we have a young team and not many people have really given us a chance so we always go into these matches as underdogs
8592318 but as players we should not put ourselves under pressure because we have home advantage and the crowd that will be behind us
8592319 we should just continue to believe in ourselves the way we did in egypt but we should show that we have learnt from our past mistakes and kill the game when we get the chance but at the same time avoiding conceding early goals from silly mistakes
8592320 we cannot afford to let ahly take the lead on saturday but i am confident that all the guys who will be available for the coach to use will do the job

8592343 were only at the beginning of two of the most profound social and economic trends of our age globalization and digitalization
8592344 laws of increasing returns in the new economy driven by a networked world
8592345 the value of a network increases exponentially as its users increase arithmetically
8592346 the more who use social networks the more attractive networks become
8592347 if a product or a company or a technology one of many competing in a market gets ahead by chance or clever strategy increasing returns can magnify this advantage and the product or company can go on to lock in the market
8592348 the archetypal case of a success explosion in a network economy is the internet itself as any proud old time nethead will be happy to explain the internet was a lonely but thrilling cultural backwater for two decades before it showed up on the media radar a graph of the number of internet hosts worldwide starting in the 1970s stays barely above the bottom line until around 1991 when the global tally of hosts suddenly mushroomed exponentially acting upward to take over the world

8592360 cocksucker blues is an amazing piece of footage but its actually quite boring to watch so there was a conscious decision not to make this into a drug fest in fact it shows how alienating it can be to spend weeks at a time travelling around the world to places where everyone is fucked up on drugs it can be a really weird experience especially if youre not on drugs too

8592366 we think theres going to be a major opportunity in ireland because the position of some of the competitors we have here isnt sustainable and doesnt make any sense
8592367 we are going to empower people locally to go and sell to the market we will be establishing a local office we operate in a low operational expenditure environment so it wont be an army of people but a small team that will work on facilitating the channel to go and sell the product

8592369 electronics have become so pervasive that consumers are looking to buy these devices wherever they want

8592372 the fourth quarter is definitely the biggest part of the year for online
8592373 netbooks are still uncompetitive in terms of their smaller keyboards and panels and are therefore still a niche device
8592374 while i cant speak for other districts over the last five years there has been a greater emphasis on reporting crimes

8592405 throughout the world health experts have learned to appreciate the role of micronutrients in preventative health yet we currently have no program in place to address this need but this is all about to change
8592406 even in places where diets are rich in these foods it can still be difficult especially for women and children to consume adequate levels that is why the ministry of health and the parliament are currently considering a program that will fortify basic staple foods like salt cassava sorghum and wheat with these vital micronutrients
8592407 while food fortification may cost as little as 100 rwf per person per year consider the impact iodine deficiency is the leading cause of mental retardation in the world and in less severe cases reduces acumen by about 15

8592409 malnourished people have much higher rates of death when faced with maladies like hiv aids tuberculosis and diarrhoea by as much as 25 as well even in cases where a patient survives the disease the amount of hospitalization and therapy required increases significantly when their bodies do not have adequate levels of micronutrients as they fight to survive

8592454 she was not feeling very well i gave her the letter so that the police would give her a form to go for a medical check up
8592455 after that the police will give her a letter to come back here and solve the matter or she and her husband can sort the matter out at the police station

8592571 the official unemployment rate understated how difficult it was to find a job in the 2000s

8592620 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8592621 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8592622 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8592623 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8592624 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8592625 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8592626 grew up well polished by gentlemanly pursuits he would ride to the hounds drive fast fly airplanes he knew good clothes fine horses the newest dance steps

8592643 the jury did a very good job at listening to different opinions and concerns

8592646 we dont know how it was split but i anticipate a significant number of those people were prepared to enter a serious verdict for our client
8592647 to have a jury here not return the same verdict with the same speed is affirming to our position
8592648 one lawsuit ought to be enough to teach a lesson
8592649 what he was trying to do was get the jury to take a look at the determination in the last case and consider that one here so they wouldnt do the same thing
8592650 that prejudiced us significantly we were at this point very happy to have a mistrial
8592651 if you give us a clean jury with facts that are fairly presented then our clients will be fairly and fully treated by this jury any jury
8592652 there was no intent by me to ignore the courts order
8592653 there was no thought of speaking in code to the jurors
8592654 i sincerely apologize to him that one chosen to be gods servant betrayed a sacred trust and so wounded him and other victims of abuse

8592658 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8592659 because the iphone doesnt support flash or java you couldnt really see the internet in its full glory

8592664 were seeing some bad applications on the iphone its stifling innovation
8592665 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8592666 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8592667 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8592668 if we settle it means we both save money on lawsuits and gives you a legal precidence on which to sue sony and make it likely to stick for doing this we want something in return
8592669 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8592670 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8592671 viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a web site normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8592672 how is it that cut and paste java and flash are still a conundrum to a big innovative company like apple

8592676 i would love to set the record straight when it comes to allegations directed to my person posted by some of you about 17 years ago god called me to start a ministry among young people in holland the name we gave it was gods pleasure during this process i acknowledge that i and my staff have made mistakes partially also due to our inexperience and lack of wisdom in how to administrate and balance the right care and help for so many diverse people and therefore have hurt some of them at that time a great majority of the dutch religious christian establishment didnt particularly approve of the way we were reaching out with the gospel using tools like heavy metal music and radical preaching in 1994 god called me to go to houston texas and i told my staff at the time that i wanted to resign they felt it wasnt the time but after all i believe it was me sinning against god by not obeying his call to resign and leave for the us right after two girls came to the ministry and wanted to be admitted to the girls houses i didnt have peace about that but was weak enough to be persuaded the mother of one of these girls started a big media persecution against me and we suffered greatly for that later we found out that this lady was well known among christian leaders and was clearly controlled by the jezebel spirit also persecuting several other churches taking these girls in also ultimately led to my wife at that time falling in sexual sin with one of the girls it was obvious that the devil was doing whatever he could to discredit and destroy me

8592873 axl rose didnt call the fbi but today it became more than obvious that someone really was serious about that threat johnny and i sat on a pew in the u s district court building in downtown l a as skwerl sat behind glass in handcuffs and still in his jammies since the fbi arrested him at 6 59 this morning after five or so other cases were presented the united states of america presented her case against skwerl the proceeding was mostly about what his bail was going to be set at the u s a requested bail be set at 50 000 skwerls court appointed attorney thankfully called b s on that one and recommended his bail be 5 000 and that this case is the kind of case where the defendant should have been summoned to appear instead of being accosted by five f b i agents at his home in a quiet neighborhood interestingly the judge chimed in to add that he had actually recommended that it be a summons case and wasnt sure why it went down as it did he also dismissed the idea presented by the u s a that squirrels be forbidden to use the internet in the end the judge ruled that his bail be in the form of a signature bond at 10 000 what that means is that skwerl has to remain within the central district of california until his next court date or someone has to cough up that 10k so for now hes home stay tuned moving forward a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for september 17th at 4 30 pm and the arraignment for september 22nd at 8 30 am both will be at the u s district court building and the address is 255 east temple street third floor in downtown los angeles skwerl johnny and i appreciate your concern and warm wishes during these hard times as we deal with democracy

8593034 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8593035 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth

8593037 joe biden is a rare mix a leader who has worked for decades in washington but has never lived there
8593038 media outlets reported allegations biden plagiarized kinnock but not that he had previously credited him
8593039 quit the 1988 presidential race in the face of accusations that he had plagiarized part of a speech from neil kinnock the british labor party leader at the time
8593040 shortly afterward he was found to have suffered two aneurysms
8593041 biden also will have his 1988 presidential campaign and the charges of plagiarism that drove him from the race resurrected at least in these opening days as he is introduced as obamas running mate but that experience is long in the past and probably does not present a significant problem

8593051 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8593052 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 percent

8593076 its like a military fight i dont think that generally the american public has any sense of the level of violence that occurs on the border
8593077 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation
8593078 we have been concerned for quite some time that this thing will spill over here
8593079 we believe the vast majority of these assaults are directly tied to alien and drug smugglers based in mexico

8593093 wir haben die letzten sechs monate damit verbracht den zusammenschluss von activison und vivendi zu beobachten und abzusch tzen ob wir ein bestandteil dieser gemeinsam zukunft sind oder nicht offensichtlich will activision kein entwicklerstudio f r strategiespiele in europa
8593094 das pc add on sovjet assault wird activision nicht ver ffentlichen
8593095 ebay inc ist das weltweit gr te internetauktionshaus das unternehmen wurde im september 1995 von pierre omidyar in san jos kalifornien unter dem namen auctionweb gegr ndet im laufe der jahre entwickelte sich ebay von einem consumer to consumer marktplatz mit flohmarkt hnlichem charakter zu einer business to consumer plattform die sowohl von privaten als auch von einer gro en anzahl gewerblicher anbieter genutzt wird
8593096 mido has given me a headache in terms of selection but thats what i expect from all the players he scored an excellent goal against yeovil and showed that he is pushing very hard when he is fully fit he is going to be a real threat for us he had a physical presence against yeovil and showed that he gives us great options
8593097 i have said to him that i want him to continue to be part of this football club he wants to play football but he knows no team can guarantee him that all he can do is work hard like he did against yeovil and then he has played his part
8593098 didier had a big impact on the game and we are delighted with the way he is settling in here
8593099 brad is waiting to see a specialist but we are optimistic that it is not a major problem
8593100 i think both brad and ross turnbull have shown in the opening games that the faith we have in them is fully justified but maybe we need some extra cover for them
8593101 the sands of time are running out before the transfer window closes and there have been no approaches for stewart
8593102 despite the newspaper speculation i think that other clubs are well aware that we are not interested in doing any business there
8593103 mit dem rauchen aufzuh ren ist ein wichtiger schritt f r die krankheitsvorsorge vielen f llt der langfristige rauchausstieg schwer daher sind gute angebote zur tabakentw hnung besonders wichtig ich freue mich dass sich auch die apotheker bei der hilfe zum ausstieg engagieren wer hilfe braucht kann sich in den apotheken bei seinem arzt oder unter www rauchfrei info de informieren
8593104 jeder elektronische zahlvorgang via chip ist nicht r ckverfolgbar die einzelnen geldkarte zahlungen erscheinen nicht auf dem kontoauszug des einzelnen und sind absolut sicher das einzige woran der verbraucher denken muss ist seine geldkarte vorab am geldautomaten oder im internet zu laden
8593105 die werte soziale verantwortung dezentrales unternehmertum die f rderung des mittelstands und die demokratischen entscheidungsstrukturen die f r genossenschaftsbanken bis heute essentiell sind haben wir hermann schulze delitzsch und nat rlich auch dem anderen gr ndervater friedrich wilhelm raiffeisen zu verdanken wir leben die genossenschaftsidee im t glichen bankgesch ft das modell der teilhabe in form der genossenschaftlichen mitgliedschaft ist der kern unseres gesch ftsmodells ber 16 millionen kunden halten genossenschaftsanteile an volksbanken und raiffeisenbanken und pflegen daher eine besonders partnerschaftliche gesch ftsbeziehung
8593106 das gedankengut schulze delitzschs spiegelt sich heute in vielen aspekten des selbstverst ndnisses und der daraus abgeleiteten kundenn he der volksbanken und raiffeisenbanken wider zum beispiel in der hundertprozentigen sicherheit der kundeneinlagen und inhaberschuldverschreibungen in nachhaltigem wirtschaften und in dem verzicht auf spekulative gesch fte was genossenschaftsbanken gerade in zeiten turbulenter finanzm rkte stabil h lt auch das versprechen vertragsgem bediente kredite nicht ohne zustimmung des kreditnehmers weiterzuverkaufen geh rt dazu
8593107 fonds wie der jpm euro liquidity fund investieren in eine breite palette konservativer geldmarktpapiere mit bester bonit t und kurzer restlaufzeit
8593108 anleger sind unternehmen banken zentralbanken pensionsfonds und depotbanken aber vermehrt auch dachfondsmanager die eine liquide anlagem glichkeit mit kalkulierbaren ertragschancen suchen auch bei privatinvestoren erfreuen sich diese zun chst rein f r institutionelle investoren konzipierten produkte zunehmender beliebtheit
8593109 mit der clearstream f higkeit des jpm euro liquidity fund ist ein solcher fonds nun auch ber die g ngigen abwicklungssysteme der gro banken und asset manager handelbar das macht die verf gbarkeit insbesondere f r nicht institutionelle anleger noch einfacher
8593110 unsere liquidity fonds haben ein top rating von den drei wichtigsten agenturen s amp p moodys und fitch erhalten und bieten damit ein besseres rating als die mehrzahl der deutschen gesch ftsbanken seit auflegung des jpm euro liquidity fund im jahr 1999 gab es keinen tag mit negativer wertentwicklung
8593111 mit dem neuen look wird clipfish f r die nutzer noch emotionaler wir f hren die plattform auch ganz bewusst n her an tv heran bei der optimierung haben wir auch die anregungen unserer nutzer einbezogen clipfish ist mit der hochwertigen neuen optik und der verbesserten struktur ganz nebenbei erwachsen geworden und ffnet sich einer noch breiteren zielgruppe
8593112 mit galileo haben wir in der entwicklung den optimalen dreiklang von design ergonomie und sitzkomfort realisiert
8593113 zweitmarktanteile sind nach wie vor ein begehrtes investment durch die breite diversifikation unserer fonds wird eine wesentlich bessere risikostreuung und einnahmensicherheit gew hrleistet als bei einem einzelinvestment
8593114 es ist zu erwarten dass uns die rfid technologie in unserem alltag k nftig ein st ndiger begleiter sein wird wir m ssen uns im rahmen eines gesellschaftlichen diskurses die frage stellen wie wir mit den damit verbundenen ver nderungen beispielsweise den auswirkungen bez glich der privatsph re umgehen wollen
8593115 die arzneimitteltherapie spielt f r die verl ngerung der mittleren lebenserwartung eine wichtige rolle sie ist verbunden mit einem gewinn von ca drei wochen pro jahr
8593116 trotz erh hter kosten f r medikamente mit einem signifikanten konomischen gewinn verbunden da nichtmedikament se ma nahmen reduziert wurden
8593117 seit anfang des 20 jahrhunderts ist die durchschnittliche lebenserwartung um mehr als 30 jahre angestiegen und das nicht zuletzt dank innovativer arzneimittel so ist die anzahl der todesf lle bei krankheiten die in deutschland die meisten opfer fordern wie krebs herzinfarkte und schlaganf lle aufgrund moderner medikamente stark zur ckgegangen auch bei anderen erkrankungen auf die besonders ltere menschen schauen wie etwa rheuma haben wir den patienten leidensdruck genommen lebensqualit t zur ckgegeben lebensjahre geschenkt auf all das sind wir als branche stolz doch hat die innovationsfeindliche kostend mpfungspolitik der bundesregierung mit ihren zum teil widerspr chlichen berregulierungen viel zu oft verhindert dass moderne medikamente noch h ufiger eingesetzt werden hier muss ein umdenken zum wohle der betroffenen einsetzen
8593118 die pharmazeutische industrie arbeitet mit hochdruck an der bek mpfung gerade der weit verbreiteten krankheiten unser ideal muss die m glichst vollst ndige heilung bleiben aber angesichts der besonderen bed rfnisse alter menschen d rfen kriterien wie verbesserte handhabung bessere kombinierbarkeit und bessere vertr glichkeit von medikamenten nicht gering gesch tzt werden
8593119 wir rechnen mit dem weiterkommen aber wit tiflis wird ein sehr unangenehmer gegner

8593175 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action
8593176 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8593178 skulpturen kr nker de religi se f lelser hos de mennesker der ser korset som et symbol p k rligheden til gud og vore frelse der fortjener respekt og religi s hengivelse

8593185 a lot of what he biden has to offer is a legacy of misstatements that make george w bush look like oscar wilde
8593186 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
8593187 game publishers and music content owners both bring critical elements to the table we hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists songwriters record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based
8593188 even five years ago madden football was breaking new songs the way fm radio used to now we see artists thinking first about the video game and second about the cd because the video game is going to instantly drive all those people over to itunes to buy the single and the ringtones and all the other stuff that makes them money
8593189 they want to be paid for someone else to advertise their product
8593190 which is not an anomaly in the history of the music industry feist got a huge boost from being featured in the itunes commercials and apple paid handsomely for the right to advertise feists music
8593191 el mayor logro en la historia del f tbol chipriota
8593192 esta es una noche maravillosa para el anorthosis y para chipre para un equipo de una naci n tan peque a como chipre y con un presupuesto tan peque o como nosotros llegar a la champions league es un sue o absoluto pero los sue os necesitan trabajo en el f tbol no se logran los xitos march ndote a la cama una noche y a la ma ana siguiente estando ya en la champions league se necesita trabajar y eso es lo que seguiremos haciendo en la fase de grupos
8593193 estamos viviendo un sue o para muchos de nosotros esto podr a ser nuestra primera y nica ocasi n de jugar en la champions league as que necesitamos saborear este momento creo que las celebraciones ya est n preparadas pero tendremos que tener los pies en el suelo para volver a jugar en la liga
8593194 me gustar a agradecer a los jugadores t cnicos socios y a todos aquellos que han ayudado al anorthosis a lograr este importante xito algunos me han dicho que les sorprende ver al presidente de un club viajando con el equipo en el autob s a m no me importa viajar en autob s ir a en bicicleta si fuera necesario

8593203 when we were mobilized we were told to prepare to do the tracks mission and to also act as a provincial infantry company
8593204 being trackers the heliborne mission conducting assaults via helicopters is new to everybody
8593205 the focus has to be more on the fire team leaders
8593206 when we were acting as a provincial rifle team doing foot patrols the squad leaders were more involved
8593207 the qrf mission makes the fire team leaders need to think more tactically about things like geometries of fire and such
8593208 theyll do four or five evolutions before things go smooth and were just trying to give them as much rehearsal time as possible
8593209 we hashed it out when we were training and found our best practices and now the sergeants are teaching it to everybody else
8593210 our teaching is very consistent so everyone will be on the same page from platoon to platoon weve been stressing teamwork too and the sticks and fire teams are free thinking so they can call that audible because as soon as you hit the deck things can change
8593211 the general mindset of this unit is that good enough is not enough expecting to do better than whats asked of us allows us to be very adaptable to the mission sets we receive from higher commands

8593238 se domani il consiglio dei ministri approva tutto se dopodomani il consiglio di amministrazione di alitalia procede ovviamente subito dopo bisogna aprire il confronto con i sindacati
8593239 sono previsti anche ammortizzatori sociali non vogliamo lasciare nessuno in mezzo a una strada
8593240 anzi se ora vorr collaborare con la nuova alitalia ci far piacere
8593241 la vecchia proposta di air france labbiamo sempre ritenuta un errore
8593242 perch era una annessione di alitalia ai francesi con un ritorno non positivo per il nostro turismo
8593243 aspettiamo lannunciata convocazione per lapertura del confronto fino ad oggi il sindacato rimasto alloscuro di tutto
8593244 non siamo disponibili ha spiegato a discutere solo degli effetti sul lavoro accettando a scatola chiusa le conseguenze di un piano industriale di cui leggiamo solo sui giornali pretendiamo chiarezza e il necessario confronto

8593252 linno simbolo dello stato e dellunit nazionale ed giusto che i ragazzi lo cantino
8593253 ci dovremo preparare questo sicuro io dellinno ne so met altri nemmeno quella
8593254 andr a parlare con loro il primo giorno di scuola se lo chiederanno potremmo distribuire il testo nelle classi
8593255 lanno scorso organizzammo nelle scuole incontri con la guardia di finanza durante lalzabandiera veniva suonato linno e gli studenti erano commossi
8593256 e una bella iniziativa ci sar annuncia bruni nei giovani si deve affermare il senso delle istituzioni e dellidentit nazionale
8593257 fratelli ditalia va insegnato a scuola grave che alle superiori ci sia chi non lo conosce
8593258 cantare linno in cortile una sceneggiata per rinsaldare unidentit che in realt debole sarebbe stato meglio fare cantare ai ragazzi not r de bergh m inno cittadino che li rappresenta davvero
8593259 no matter what you label it this is a new america
8593260 no it is not the panacea not the end of race in america but it is striking evidence of a promise fulfilled a dream redeemed
8593261 its remarkable to find these patterns in the students in the study we have seen many examples where people do this out of necessity but we still see these tendencies in people who are already provided for

8593265 al principio siempre crees que es algo que se arreglar no te imaginas que pueda acabar derivando en problemas tan graves est bamos perdidos hab a sido un hijo muy deseado y no fuimos capaces de adivinar tantas dobleces en un ni o peque o

8593267 nos preocupa que los fiscales act en con unidad de criterio en esta cuesti n por eso en conexi n con la fiscal a espec fica de violencia de g nero trabajamos en unas pautas de tratamiento del problema estamos asimilando lo que nos trasladan los fiscales de a pie de toda espa a sobre todo los de menores que cada vez hay m s chicos entre 12 y 18 a os que son protagonistas en casos de violencia familiar
8593268 van en aumento y adem s es el nico delito en el que veo que chicos y chicas estar an casi igualados en edades y sexos 16 17 a os pero todav a hay muchos padres que no denuncian por verg enza en granada estamos concienci ndoles de que es mejor que lo hagan porque hay situaciones verdaderamente conflictivas pero muchos tapan la situaci n
8593269 a diario me escriben o llaman padres desesperados con la violencia de sus hijos adolescentes casi siempre chicos y s me sorprende el n mero importante de hijos que pegan o maltratan a los padres porque en los a os noventa no lo hubi ramos previsto pero todav a me sorprende m s que stos los denuncien pero cuando lo hacen es que a veces es el nico camino que tienen para proteger a los hermanos
8593270 los comportamientos violentos de los ni os siempre han existido pero en los ltimos a os se han acrecentado y lo detectan los padres los m dicos y los profesores
8593271 la causa es mixta tanto biol gica chicos que tienen mayor dificultad en desarrollar emociones morales y una conciencia como sociol gica ahora se desprestigia el sentimiento de culpa y se alienta la gratificaci n inmediata y el hedonismo la familia y la escuela han perdido capacidad de educaci n y esto favorece que chicos con esa predisposici n biol gica que antes eran contenidos por la sociedad tengan mucha m s facilidad para exhibir la violencia
8593272 la insensibilidad es una caracter stica de estos ni os
8593273 veo peque os que desde los tres a os tienen unas rabietas tremendas no obedecen son agresivos y ya en la guarder a pegan y no pueden jugar si no es desde la imposici n y la violencia por fortuna las conductas verdaderamente agresivas y peligrosas como retar a los padres y pegarles suponen un porcentaje menor y se producen a partir de los 13 o 14 a os y si hay una predisposici n gen tica para m sin ning n g nero de dudas lo que facilita que afloren estos trastornos de conducta son los factores ambientales
8593274 estamos ante chavales que lo tienen todo que no se han puesto l mites yo creo que hay que recuperar los principios de autoridad paterna y de la escuela pero sobre todo de los padres no hemos sabido poner l mites a nuestros hijos es la ley del p ndulo nos hemos pasado de un extremo al otro la pr xima generaci n estar m s preparada para educar con cierta autoridad y al tiempo con flexibilidad
8593275 creo que es un problema general de violencia con los adultos que se ejerce contra profesores y familias en un estudio con adolescentes conflictivos hemos detectado distintas actitudes familiares comunes una que las familias hab an utilizado el castigo f sico cuando el ni o era peque o aportando un modelo autoritario de dominio sumisi n para intentar controlarlo otra donde se combinaban los m todos coercitivos utilizados en el franquismo con una permisividad excesiva una permisividad que se convierte en violencia cuando el ni o intenta salirse con la suya desobedecer y someter al adulto y entonces se vuelve un peque o tirano y tambi n existe una mezcla de ambas
8593276 fue un ni o muy querido y le he dedicado mucha atenci n miro hacia atr s y creo que no he sido una madre consentidora le exig a porque era un ni o inteligente a lo mejor demasiado me pregunto en qu me he equivocado
8593277 es tu hijo y nadie lo entiende toda la familia se pone en contra es luchar contra corriente
8593278 soy como un reh n en mi propia casa es como tener un marido violento pero con un hijo duele mucho pero no se puede vivir as siempre con miedo
8593279 estos chicos coinciden con la personalidad del psic pata la mayor a no lo son pero tienen rasgos t picos de este trastorno como una gran impulsividad profundo egocentrismo e incapacidad para sentirse culpables y mostrar arrepentimiento ante la desesperaci n de los padres no sirven las rega inas conversaciones y castigos tienen conductas habituales de desaf o mentiras e incluso actos crueles hacia los hermanos y amistades
8593280 aparte de la insensibilidad hacia los dem s son muy fr os y tienen una visi n de la vida terriblemente narcisista empieza en ellos y termina en ellos
8593281 son familias de clase media o media alta un denominador com n es que son las madres las que dan el primer paso porque tienen una actitud m s abierta y decidida y otro que lo hacen cuando ya es una situaci n insoportable y degradante porque para las familias es una historia de las m s ocultas cuando hablamos de acoso escolar se dicen los nombres pero esto es parecido al abuso sexual una verg enza para la familia algo que procura mantener en secreto
8593282 t picas de una sociedad en la que los padres no tienen mucho tiempo para dedicar a los hijos pero a los que no puede culpabiliz rseles de todo
8593283 lo que yo denomino s ndrome del emperador se caracteriza por que el hijo abusa de los padres de la madre m s habitualmente cuando stos no han sido negligentes y sin que haya causas sociales que lo expliquen
8593284 las que han sido incapaces de imponer un l mite y eso al chico le causa sensaci n de abandono porque cuando se relaciona con otros chicos ve que tienen l mites y se pregunta si a l no le quieren casos frecuentes de inmigrantes latinoamericanos y magreb es y aquellas familias m s ligadas a una clase media en las que sucede todo lo contrario han intentado desde el principio marcar a los hijos unas directrices muy claras y exhaustivas un modelo de relaci n muy autoritario y entonces el chico busca la individualizaci n a trav s del conflicto
8593285 porque a veces han luchado durante a os con la administraci n para adoptarlos y resulta tremendo
8593286 pero hay que dejar muy claro que estos casos de violencia son extremos y excepcionales la punta del iceberg de algo muy grave que est pasando pero que hay que contextualizar sin ofrecer una visi n distorsionada la novedad es que como la violencia en las aulas son conductas que antes se ocultaban
8593287 el extraordinario desarrollo econ mico espa ol ha creado una especie de sacralizaci n de todo lo material que los padres transmiten a los hijos dici ndoles que tienen que tener mucha seguridad en s mismos porque lo tienen todo el individuo deja de valer lo que es para pasar a valer lo que tiene o un paso m s lo que los dem s ven que tiene y eso que se transmite es malo
8593288 muchos padres lo podr an haber hecho mejor no han afrontado la realidad cuando el problema era manejable simplemente no han estado a la altura de las circunstancias pero hay otros que lo han hecho muy bien y est n destrozados los casos en los que los padres s lo se han preocupado de ganar dinero y dejar a los hijos ante el televisor sos para m son padres incompetentes y en cierto sentido maltratadores
8593289 nos echan la culpa a los padres porque no sabemos educar a los hijos pero lo que nos falta es informaci n te pueden llamar mal padre cuando tienes la informaci n necesaria y no la pones en pr ctica pero no cuando lo haces lo mejor que puedes
8593290 lo nico que hac a era llevarlo y traerlo del colegio para que no se metiera en peleas s lo ten a nueve a os
8593291 porque no le d bamos dinero porque no pon amos en la televisi n el programa que quer a o simplemente porque le mir bamos
8593292 todo se quedaba en un juicio de faltas le pon an una multa y listo a nadie le importaba que estuviera maltratando a sus hermanos menores
8593293 al principio no cont bamos nada al entorno ni a la familia pero es una situaci n que tiene que salir a la luz para que los padres veamos que no somos el nico caso
8593294 hay que desarrollar una conciencia s lida en el chico
8593295 aplicar castigos razonables y explicar las razones morales y pr cticas que supone su acci n el problema de los ni os con s ndrome del emperador es que es mucho m s dif cil de lograr pero hay que empezar desde la cuna
8593296 tuvimos un momento de mucho deterioro familiar pero fuimos saliendo no sab a nada del s ndrome del emperador y al ver que mi hijo era su vivo retrato me qued horrorizada
8593297 no se puede vivir as con este miedo los malos tratos son permanentes rompe las puertas me insulta me zarandea me roba
8593298 nadie entiende que puedas denunciar a un hijo ni la familia ni los amigos te culpabilizas y te sientes muy sola pero hay que decirlo
8593299 acuden m s madres aunque hay bastantes padres y pueden venir separados o en pareja escuchamos orientamos y damos pautas de comportamiento tambi n hemos puesto en marcha el primer grupo de 11 padres y est teniendo mucho xito
8593300 todos los padres que vienen a consulta o terapia en estos momentos unas 40 familias persiguen lo mismo orientaci n y soluciones
8593301 s lo pedimos que las administraciones ofrezcan centros y personal especializado que atienda a estos ni os
8593302 el elemento esencial del s ndrome del emperador es la ausencia de conciencia son ni os que gen ticamente tienen mayor dificultad para percibir las emociones morales para sentir empat a compasi n o responsabilidad y como consecuencia tienen problemas para sentir culpa
8593303 el sistema nervioso de estos chicos por alguna raz n tiene problemas para aprender las lecciones morales para sentir empat a compasi n o responsabilidad y como consecuencia de esto tienen problemas para sentir culpa una reacci n emocional que s lo puede existir sobre la base de que previamente me he vinculado con la gente podr fingir que lo lamento pero en el interior a m me da igual como consiguiente hay una ausencia de conciencia
8593304 que tienen conciencia los valores y creencias que utilizamos para guiar nuestro comportamiento y que est basado en esas emociones
8593305 la herencia marca tendencia pero lo que cambia el ser humano es totalmente la educaci n sobre todo en los primeros a os en los primeros meses y d as incluso antes de nacer es muy distinto si eres un hijo deseado o no si eres un padre relajado o agresivo
8593306 algunos psic logos y pedagogos han transmitido el criterio de que no se le puede decir no a un ni o cuando lo que le neurotiza es no saber cu les son sus l mites no saber lo que est bien y est mal sa es la raz n de que tengamos ni os caprichosos y consentidos con una filosof a muy hedonista y nihilista
8593307 el fiscal sigue un atestado de la polic a o una denuncia directamente de la familia e incoa un procedimiento ese procedimiento incluye declaraci n de menor de los padres y de todas las personas que hayan podido tener relaci n con esto se aporta un informe psicol gico puesto que tiene que hacer referencia a las medidas m s adecuadas para aplicar al menor cuando se incoa el procedimiento hay que decidir si el menor va a seguir con la familia o si va a ser ingresado en un centro de reforma como consecuencia del peligro que pueda correr su familia esa decisi n la solicita el fiscal y la toma el juez de menores luego el fiscal realiza un informe con la descripci n detallada de los hechos y solicita medidas el informe lo traslada al juez de menores que inicia un juicio
8593308 un ni o que maltrata a sus padres en el fondo quiere decir algo y habla con el cuerpo en vez de utilizar la voz son chicos que evidencian una grave falla en la funci n paterna
8593309 el elemento esencial de estos chicos es la ausencia de conciencia porque no tienen sentimiento de vinculaci n moral o emocional ni con sus padres ni con otras personas
8593310 en la escuela est n solos no pueden tener amigos porque sus compa eros no respetan las reglas que imponen los ni os con problemas de conducta tambi n hay casos de chicos que est n ausentes y callados pero que cuando llegan a sus casas explotan y maltratan a sus madres
8593311 cuando los padres no pueden transmitirle la ley a sus hijos hay una ausencia de l mites esta falencia influye en la personalidad de estos ni os

8593452 from the days of spartacus weishaupt to those of karl marx to those of trotsky bela kun rosa luxembourg and emma goldman this world wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality has been steadily growing it played a definitely recognizable role in the tragedy of the french revolution it has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the nineteenth century and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of europe and america have gripped the russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire
8593453 when the federal reserve act was passed the people of these united states did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here a super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure every effort has been made by the fed to conceal its powers but the truth is the fed has usurped the government it controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations it makes and breaks governments at will
8593454 it was no accident it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so they might emerge as the rulers of us all
8593455 obviously there is going to be no peace or prosperity for mankind as long as the earth remains divided into 50 or 60 independent states until some kind of international system is created the real problem today is that of world government
8593456 although world government had been plainly coming for some years although it had been endlessly feared and murmured against it found no opposition anywhere
8593457 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government since the days of andrew jackson
8593458 the hour for the ancient mysteries has arrived these ancient mysteries were hidden in numbers in ritual in words and in symbology these veil the secret there is no question therefore that the work to be done in familiarizing the general public with the nature of the mysteries is of paramount importance at this time these mysteries will be restored to outer expression through the medium of the church and the masonic fraternity
8593459 out of the spoliation of all existing culture and civilization the new world order must be built
8593460 today of course we are not strong enough to attack to win we shall need the element of surprise the western world will have to be put to sleep so we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record there shall be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions the capitalist countries stupid and decadent will rejoice to cooperate to their own destruction they will leap at another chance to be friends as soon as their guard is down we shall smash them with our clenched fist
8593461 the manifest necessity for some collective world control to eliminate warfare and the less generally admitted necessity for a collective control of the economic and biological life of mankind are aspects of one and the same process
8593462 it will be just as easy for nations to get along in a republic of the world as it is for us to get along in a republic of the united states
8593463 how far can the life of nations which for centuries have thought of themselves as distinct and unique be merged with the life of other nations how far are they prepared to sacrifice a part of their sovereignty without which there can be no effective economic or political union
8593464 we shall have world government whether or not you like it by conquest or consent
8593465 we at the executive level here were active in either the oss forerunner of the cia the state department or the european economic administration during those times and without exception we operated under directives issued by the white house we are continuing to be guided by just such directives the substance of which were to the effect that we should make every effort to so alter life in the united states as to make possible a comfortable merger with the soviet union
8593466 today the path to total dictatorship in the united states can be laid by strictly legal means unseen and unheard by congress the president or the people
8593467 new international order which must be responsive to world aspirations for peace for social and economic change an international order including states labeling themselves as socialist communist
8593468 cannot escape and indeed should welcome the task which history has imposed upon us this is the task of helping to shape a new world order in all its dimensions spiritual economic political social
8593469 a fever of nationalism but the nation state is becoming less and less competent to perform its international political tasks these are some of the reasons pressing us to lead vigorously toward the true building of a new world order sooner perhaps than we may realize there will evolve the bases for a federal structure of the free world
8593470 the high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the americans freedom and before i leave office i must inform the citizens of this plight
8593471 there does exist and has existed for a generation an international network which operates to some extent in the way the radical right believes the communists act in fact this network which we may identify as the round table groups has no aversion to cooperating with the communists or any other groups and frequently does so i know of the operations of this network because i have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records i have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have for much of my life been close to it and to many of its instruments i have objected both in the past and recently to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown and i believe its role in history is significant enough to be known
8593472 as president he would work toward international creation of a new world order
8593473 some opponents of humanism have accused us of wishing to overthrow the traditional christian family they are right that is exactly what we intend to do
8593474 marxism represents a further vital and creative stage in the maturing of mans universal vision marxism is simultaneously a victory of the external active man over the inner passive man and a victory of reason over belief marxism disseminated on the popular level in the form of communism represents a major advance in mans ability to conceptualize his relationship to the world
8593475 technology will make available to the leaders of major nations a variety of techniques for conducting secret warfare of which only a bare minimum of security forces need be appraised one nation may attack a competitor covertly techniques of weather modification could be employed to produce prolonged periods of drought or storm thereby weakening a nations capacity and forcing it to accept the demands of the competitor

8593484 this fortified tower was built by sir john delves in 1364 on the site of a former moated manor house the tower was initially free standing and was probably intended as a place of refuge for the family in the 17th century it was incorporated into a range of domestic buildings which were known as doddington hall 3 in the civil war the hall became a garrison for the parliamentary forces it was taken for the king by lord byron in january 1644 but retaken shortly after in 1727 the house and estate passed to the broughton family the house was demolished around 1777 and replaced by the new doddington hall leaving the tower as a landscape feature which was possibly used as a gazebo or a banqueting pavilion the external staircase to the former house was retained when the house was demolished and it was attached to the tower

8593534 sono operazioni afferma il vice sindaco e assessore alla sicurezza riccardo de corato che hanno consentito di contenere e ridurre lemergenza rom
8593535 i numeri del censimento sono quelli che aspettavamo dice de corato e non costituiscono una sorpresa nella flessione delle cifre contano indubbiamente il fatto che le identificazioni siano state fatte destate ma anche la buona e costante azione di moral suasion attuata da comune prefettura e questura
8593536 se oggi la situazione meno pesante rispetto a un anno e mezzo fa spiega ancora de corato lo si deve proprio allazione costante di alleggerimento nelle aree occupate abusivamente operata dal comune attraverso la polizia locale e da prefettura e questura con le forze dellordine cui va il dovuto ringraziamento senza dimenticare lapplicazione della direttiva ue sul diritto di soggiorno oltre i 90 giorni dei comunitari che ha consentito attualmente lidentificazione di circa 2400 soggetti prevalentemente rom romeni in seguito ai controlli nelle baraccopoli nei campi e agli angoli delle strade

8593604 because of excessive revisions and inputs from a wide number of people the draft policy now sounds more like a law than a policy
8593605 and this was exactly the observation of the law ministry about the policy when the energy ministry sent the draft to the law ministry a few months back
8593606 that is why the law ministry observed that instead of such a policy the government should work on several laws instead of just one

8593628 today we are faced with im not afraid to say a historic decision to call upon the president of the russian federation to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8593629 this is a consequence of the recognition of kosovo by the west and western policy in the balkans
8593630 as president of south ossetia and on behalf of the south ossetian parliament and its people with all gratitude to the president of the russian federation i once again call for the recognition of south ossetia as an independent state
8593631 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
8593632 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
8593633 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
8593634 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia some question the territorial integrity of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far
8593635 but american investors are now looking at the situation around russia with concern and asking questions
8593636 we blame georgia and america for the war its the second time theyve bombed us we cant bear it anymore no one can guarantee that georgia wont bomb us again
8593637 independence would be good in theory but we cannot defend ourselves against georgia so we need to be part of russia if russia didnt support us then there would probably be no us left on this earth
8593638 after all weve gone through i dont want to go back to tskhinvali words cannot describe the five days we spent hiding in our basement scared for our lives i am haunted by those memories
8593639 im doing my best to take care of them i feel so sorry for them they arrived here with nothing and needed a roof over their heads
8593640 i know that human rights were violated during the conflict
8593641 i am only here to look at the human rights situation and come up with recommendations on how these rights can be protected in the future our report will be objective and impartial
8593642 many people had their rights violated including the primary right to life to housing and so on and this issue requires much attention so weve come to find out what happened from that perspective
8593643 the longer this draws out the more difficult its going to be to get the economy rolling again
8593644 im sure warren buffett can get a good home loan at any time

8593656 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt
8593657 look i owe the american people an apology if i had beaten the old man youd have never heard of the kid and you wouldnt be in this mess so its all my fault and i feel that very very strongly
8593658 i was the first of the democrats to face this republican attack machine and i just did a terrible job of dealing with it obama and biden didnt fall off the christmas tree yesterday they know whats hitting em and i think theyre ready for this

8593692 whereas transfers at other clubs are decided by a few board members this decision will be taken by 30 000 board members

8593696 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8593697 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8593698 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8593699 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8593700 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8593701 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8593710 toyota are a team that have been up and down really throughout their history perhaps less so this year than previously
8593711 we know that when it comes to the high downforce tracks they are very very good and hungary was an example of that
8593712 valencia they seemed to be struggling at the beginning and on friday both drivers seemed to be pretty unhappy with their cars but they got the things to a good result on sunday
8593713 we never underestimate anyone we know all our competitors need to be treated with respect and we need to fight hard with them
8593714 i do believe that we can beat toyota i do believe that we fundamentally have a better car than them and we are a better team than them but its not going to be easy
8593715 i think we are all proud of the progress we have made this year i would still argue that we have out developed everyone with the possible exception of mclaren in our respective places
8593716 it is going to be a tough fight to the end particularly with toyota but we have others snapping at our heels as well
8593717 as we have spoken about before it is a balancing act between trying to develop the car through to the end of the season and get the 2009 car going
8593718 we have still got another major package for singapore so we are not giving up the fight
8593719 we know it is going to be a hard one but we are desperate to get that fourth place
8593720 they toyota are 10 points ahead but it is not insurmountable in six races
8593721 these things are normally decided by one or two results rather than a question of chipping away at races it is normally something that will go for us or against us that will decide it
8593722 we have to make sure that if and when the opportunity comes we pounce on it and take it

8593740 i feel privileged to have worked for the fringe it is the greatest arts festival on the planet and plays an important role in developing and showcasing new performing talent on a world stage
8593741 however the role of fringe director has taken me away from my first love producing and presenting exciting performances to audiences and my intention is to return to that more direct relationship with artists and audiences
8593742 i have been considering this for some time but felt it was important not to announce my departure before the festival so as not to impact on this years festival
8593743 following discussion with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect
8593744 the board is very grateful to jon for his significant contribution to the fringe at a challenging time of great change

8593845 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8594010 the proposed five farmland as collateral bills in congress are shotgun pieces of legislation they are meant to re concentrate lands in the hands of landed monopolies and deny peasant land rights all over the country
8594011 the house of representatives should realize that a farmland as collateral bill if enacted into law would not provide farmers broader access to credit they should consider that most of the agrarian reform beneficiaries are impoverished and bankrupt and would find it difficult to repay loans thus it would lead to cancellation of the eps and cloas through foreclosure of the mortgages this would lead to re concentration of the lands back to the hands of the landowners or the moneyed few
8594012 this figure does not include pending cases of cancellation of eps and cloas before the dar the agrarian reform department records likewise show that there are almost 50 000 cases pending before it which involve exemption conversion and cancellation of eps and cloas
8594013 shall be paid for by the beneficiaries to the lbp land bank of the philippines or the landowner in thirty 30 annual amortizations at six percent interest per annum
8594014 the land bank of the philippines shall have a lien by way of mortgage on the land awarded to beneficiary and this mortgage may be foreclosed by the lbp for non payment of an aggregate of three annual amortizations
8594015 a beneficiary whose land as provided herein has been foreclosed shall thereafter be permanently disqualified from becoming a beneficiary under this act

8594287 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8594288 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8594289 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies

8594371 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8594372 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it
8594373 if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
8594374 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8594375 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8594376 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8594377 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8594378 or to put it in the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life
8594379 none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide
8594380 catholics especially politicians who publicly defend abortion should not receive communion and ministers of communion should be responsibly charitable in denying it to them if they ask for it until they have reformed their lives
8594381 abortion including the willful destruction of human embryos and euthanasia are always intrinsically evil since they involve the intentional killing of innocent life
8594382 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8594383 of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
8594384 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8594385 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness
8594386 would offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community

8594423 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8594424 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8594425 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8594426 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies

8594447 theyre going all of these routes threats intimation to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit

8594486 a dwarf nicknamed od died when he bounced sideways from a trampoline and was swallowed by a yawning hippopotamus which was waiting to appear in the next act
8594487 vets on the scene said hilda the hippo had a gag reflex which automatically caused her to swallow
8594488 unfortunately the 1000 plus spectators continued to applaud wildly until common sense dictated there had been a tragic mistake police said the trampoline has been sent for forensic analysis

8594495 the workers were told there was a mandatory meeting in a storage room after management herded them all into one place they left the room and ice agents entered and arrested 59 employees these people committed no crime to be arrested and deported they work and pay taxes like everybody else
8594496 if you want peace raise up your fist if you want justice you must resist
8594497 undocumented immigrants are some of the most exploited members of our communities and have limited power to fight for their rights due to the threat of deportation i think that is one of the most important reasons for sds to stand in solidarity and take direct action
8594498 the law can be and often is unjust and when it is when this occurs it is our moral obligation to fight that law i believe that many years from now we will look back and see that this is the same rationalization used to oppress immigrants throughout our nations history the japanese internment camps during world war ii italian immigrants a century ago and irish immigrants as far back as the 1840s are all examples of this sort of mentality
8594499 writing a journal does me good i can let off my indignation at the wrongs i see and hear i am far happier when i write a little every day i take more note too of passing events and see more of what is going on around me i live less in the past and future and more in the present when i journalize it saves me from many dark hours to write down what i see and hear and feel daily my soul would turn in upon and consume itself if i did not thus let it out into my journal
8594500 to write down what i see and hear and feel daily
8594501 to see more of what is going on around me
8594502 quite out of keeping with the rush of the age we now demand the light artillery of the intellect we need the curt the condensed the pointed the readily diffused in place of the verbose the detailed the voluminous the inaccessible
8594503 wait wait come on dont be mad okay i was a jerk i tricked you but look at what high regard youre held in you were the last thing on the list and you know they do those things in order of difficulty
8594504 he didnt want her to leave mad hell he didnt want her to leave at all
8594505 immediatly scolding himself for thinking that then he tells her that jamie gave him gladys adress
8594506 i can make forcefields of any kind or shape or density so i just sort of made a field around me and walked up the side of your building and then i used another one to break your door i figured if it was all dramatic and quick you wouldnt have time to argue
8594507 you dont want to seem like a dried up spinster and ruin all our fun and your reputation
8594508 you tricked me and you used me and now you want me to have a drink
8594509 my dream clubs are arsenal and barcelona if clubs of that stature are interested in you then you cannot say no
8594510 im certainly open to interest from arsenal and from what i hear feyenoord are happy to hear from them as well
8594511 its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8594512 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it
8594513 if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
8594514 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8594515 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8594516 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8594517 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8594518 or to put it in the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life
8594519 none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide
8594520 catholics especially politicians who publicly defend abortion should not receive communion and ministers of communion should be responsibly charitable in denying it to them if they ask for it until they have reformed their lives
8594521 abortion including the willful destruction of human embryos and euthanasia are always intrinsically evil since they involve the intentional killing of innocent life
8594522 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8594523 of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
8594524 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8594525 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness
8594526 would offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community

8594558 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
8594559 open source let us take the status quo of that industry and our own limited resources and innovate
8594560 we started in 2001 as three kids fresh out of college
8594561 we took what open source had and then gave back to the community our improvements
8594562 one of our key decisions as a startup was making our software available for free download payment on the honor system for a fully functional version of our product put us in the same predicament that was almost like following a shareware business model
8594563 what we were doing was unheard of in the security space
8594564 we give our resellers hefty margins we know what makes resellers tick based on our own reselling days we are the tool providers to their customers
8594565 even the small guys are growing astaros having multiple offices is a plus for them they are playing in a global market in terms of being in the american market he does need a presence in the u s
8594566 the initial risk was that open source would hold hichert back but he leveraged it to make it work for his needs
8594567 joining astaros partner program allows resellers to take advantage of a newly built field channel marketing team resources training as well as aggressive margins of up to 40 percent
8594568 more mid size businesses are relying on the internet mission critical security is more urgent for them a small business can fail because of that
8594569 astaro needs to meet channel driven competition the company has to make sure it has a strong base to move up from

8594579 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people

8594581 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8594582 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8594583 the way from god to a human heart is through a human heart
8594584 not gonna happen ill miss getting to the gates before they close
8594585 sen barack obama d ill is tightening the reins on campaign speeches and stressing that speakers emphasize a rags to riches theme
8594586 one of my proudest moments was when i received keys to my first classroom it was high quality public education that allowed this son of strawberry sharecroppers raised in the japanese american internment camps of world war ii to grow up to become a peace corps volunteer a vice chair of the dnc and chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus
8594587 my name is austin these are my sisters maddie and lily how did we get here well it started with few strong americans my great grandmother mildred was a single mom which was tough thankfully she was strong and independent and wasnt afraid to state her opinions even when women werent supposed to be heard from
8594588 the important thing to come out of the convention is barack obamas message
8594589 you can safely assume that youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do
8594590 the turanganui a kiwa claim was to be the model of accelerating claim process chief judge joe williams really led with that and got to a stage where we have been negotiating with them for the last three years and certainly theyve been positioned and tomorrow we go to mangatu to encourage them to finalise things
8594591 i think if it hadnt been for the pressure put on by our side things would have been meandering on the government needed a bit of a kick up its backside in terms of its processes weve certainly seen a rush of agreements in principle and i think its a good idea that people get focused on a date in terms of the furnishing of a claim the issue is get the claims in get them sorted so we can move on
8594592 eating healthy is one of the major ways of getting better through any disease my book is co written and endorsed by trevor smith who is a leading new zealand cancer and breast cancer expert and hell be putting his two cents in for both of us to create a fabulous cookbook
8594593 you go through the justice system top to bottom and young brown men particularly young maori men tend to be treated more harshly by the system more likely to be stopped by police more likely to be searched by police more likely to be arrested is theres anything going on likely to get a harsher sentence and certainly add tasers into that equation and theres no doubt in my mind that primarily whos going to be tasered is young maori men
8594594 now the idea may be nice about maori economic development in that you would find no one to stand in the way of maori economic development but its the way you go about it and you shouldnt be able to go about stealing other peoples money because thats exactly what this is

8594597 admonished her followers not to put their affection for her over the issues when she reproved them for thinking for even a moment that her historic thrilling campaign was more important that the real campaign to defeat the republicans
8594598 where any of her followers could have gotten the idea doesnt seem to have crossed her mind
8594599 she never once said the truth which is that any hillary supporter who doesnt understand this issue alone is the reason to vote for obama has no business pretending to be a democrat

8594603 so the question is after the federal election will they share lists with one another
8594604 weve had various conversations with operators in the past but no one has committed
8594605 part of the issue is it was built for infant and toddler care which requires a staff to child ratio of 1 4 so when operators do up a budget to develop that care it becomes difficult
8594606 i think we need to hold on to that information
8594607 its hard to break even so the operating organization often has to make up the difference through fundraising

8594621 we do use the application storage directory and the users temp directory for file transfers though and the file filestream and filereference classes were the key to making it work
8594622 theyre moving four tonnes of the stuff to extract a single barrel from the oil sands
8594623 two tonnes of overburden and two tonnes of the oil sands itself just to get one barrel
8594624 weve already leased 65 000 square kilometres which is an area twice the size of vancouver island
8594625 weve done that with no environmental assessment whatsoever you can lease land in those land sales we hold every two weeks that starts the ball rolling on the development process right by the time we get to the environmental assessment stage its too late and no project has ever been turned down
8594626 the idea behind it is instead of looking at projects on a one by one project by project basis as a government we are going to be looking at a regional perspective and involving different stakeholders from the region
8594627 we do know the impact of tailings ponds is one of the major environmental concerns that we have to address
8594628 thats why we have invested millions of dollars into research into dry tailings and different ways to manage that we just dont have anything right now ready to implement but it is something that is a priority and is being researched heavily
8594629 the government hasnt taken any responsibility or leadership in making sure that the rapid expansion isnt to the detriment of our environment
8594630 you have a community in a crisis situation over infrastructure issues and housing both residential and commercial
8594631 controlled by strict government approved environmental standards that are among the most comprehensive in the world
8594632 regulations which came into effect on july 1 2007 require facilities emitting more than 100 000 tonnes of ghgs annually to reduce emissions intensity by 12 per cent
8594633 if we want to attract the best and the brightest we need to pay accordingly
8594634 we found that the b c hydro site was the one that would have the least impact on the environment
8594635 we have been fighting pleading to get a planner for our neighbourhood i think the city is just starting to understand that were not going away
8594636 it would be an unfortunate result should it be a neighbourhood of social housing only and nothing else
8594637 everybody recognizes it is a low income neighbourhood and it always will be
8594638 the key important improvement is only going to come when this neighbourhood planning is part of a larger strategy the drug issue and affordable housing are national issues we need to make sure our work is connected with other levels of government
8594639 its feasible conceivable that the government could try to offset some of this growth slowdown with increased spending or perhaps some reduction in taxation or perhaps a combination of the two the growth slowdown that i see is quite different from a broad based contraction to which i think most agree that there should be some kind of government response
8594640 we need to be working towards guaranteed livable income its a very different concept than any other party has and thats to use all of the support that comes to individuals in one form or another and to essentially set up a system similar to old age security short of that we need to make sure that there is adequate accommodation and incomes for people who are on income assistance
8594641 a lot of the time our policies cater to the interest of taxpayers more so than citizens the poor the unemployed the homemakers or people who raise families and care for dependents at home children the not taxpayers for the most part and so because we dont focus on the welfare of citizens we arent getting the services to those who benefit most from them
8594642 a downturn could spell disaster for the new immigrant who has no canadian experience and education the government could help by giving subsidies to housing tuition foreign credential evaluation fees and expansion of skills the government should have an intensive campaign to let new immigrants know what government services are available to them
8594643 we now have the lowest provincial income tax rate for low and middle income families of any province in canada lower income families in british columbia now pay less for their medications than they did in the past the premium assistance programs for health insurance now mean that lower income families pay less than they did in the past we have been able to put a lot of those supports in place and they will certainly continue
8594644 one in five children lives in poverty here in b c and when you really break that down and ask yourself why its because their parents are poor their parents are trapped in these low wage jobs without any kind of security and future
8594645 certainly when the economy is growing faster it generally results in some benefits for even the poor but not in all cases obviously
8594646 it will probably show that there will be some softening of predictions on the b c economy but i think we still have strong fundamentals to our economy
8594647 it will depend on whether people in some way associate an economic downturn with mismanagement by the liberals and similarly whether carole james and the ndp could have done a better job
8594648 it makes me feel this managing consumer toxins isnt as important to them as theyre saying and theyre not really as concerned as theyre advertising that they are
8594649 its a huge issue you go to the grocery store and ive got like 10 different chemicals in my head that i know i have to be careful of and i am responsible for remembering what they are what is the carcinogenic one whats the really bad one and you can only handle so much so i think a lot of women end up saying no im not interested no i dont care or its better if i dont know anything because of how overwhelming it is
8594650 market campaigns have their place but it cant be a market campaign thats just for rich people
8594651 having access to our decision makers has got to be a fundamental human right

8594670 with police and the security industry you get people who are given positions of authority and they can get carried away with it
8594671 when you get somebody with an authority complex dealing with somebody who is socially frowned upon in a community that has a lot of negative connotations associated with it then youll have a guard who is just going to bark and tell people what to do and be rude which isnt necessary
8594672 perhaps the most culturally diverse group of people that you could imagine

8594675 does the bst really prepare them for what they are going to deal with on the ground
8594676 no it gives them a general set of principles and guidelines but i think there needs to be something more thorough

8594880 we do not have all of the data right now but we know that nm100060 was safe with no adverse events novartis is in the early stages of reviewing the data and may take two to three months to generate the final report for competitive reasons novartis has asked us not to release any information regarding the specific results they will publish those results at a later time according to industry standards in the meantime novartis is continuing with a comparator study in europe which will be completed in early 2009 with results in mid 2009
8594881 this news is disappointing to us however it is important to note that the agreement with novartis is still in place so long as this agreement is in place and we believe that it will remain so we are entitled to receive the anticipated 3 5 million when our pending u s patent claim is allowed we expect this to take place soon in addition we have been told by novartis that should the results from the study in europe be deemed sufficient to file in europe they may pursue european approval first we would then be entitled to those milestones the european patent office has allowed the claim on our application this does not trigger a milestone but it does insure us full royalty payments for sales in those countries with patent coverage

8594952 the international olympic committee could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics just think about the audiences in the sub continent
8594953 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 is how do we make it work
8594954 we definitely need a carve out period im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8594955 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8594956 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game

8594960 i am really happy to play in a team like milan
8594961 for me this is a dream come true everything has happened really fast in a week
8594962 everything here is incredible the people are very easy going and they have made me feel like im at home
8594963 it was delightful to play in that kind of performance and obviously it was nice to get my first full game under my belt
8594964 i thought i played alright but that the team as a whole performed very well and so that made it easy for me to show what i could do
8594965 i came on at left back late on at liverpool and that was a tough start for me not because of the position because i have played there for arsenal before and am comfortable with it but because it was a very tough game against a very good team at anfield
8594966 but against yeovil i was at right back which is my natural position and where i am used to playing and i think i did well there but to be honest it is just nice to be out there wherever you are on the pitch
8594967 i can see a lot of similarities between the way boro play and arsenal

8594971 il napoli ha bisogno dei suoi tifosi anche in trasferta
8594972 lapertura del settore ospiti per la trasferta dellolimpico una grande occasione che i nostri sostenitori sapranno cogliere nella maniera giusta e corretta
8594973 siamo lieti del provvedimento assunto nella settimana che precede lavvio del campionato la consideriamo una grande opportunit che viene data ai tifosi non solo del napoli ma di tutta italia per non privarsi dello spettacolo sportivo allo stadio e una decisione positiva in linea con il nuovo governo e con lapertura mentale del nuovo capo della polizia uomo di grande valore tutto questo per deve rappresentare un motivo di riflessione da parte di tutti ci preme molto pertanto dare un messaggio ai nostri sostenitori affinch raccolgano ed interpretino questa occasione nella maniera giusta e corretta
8594974 questo un appello molto sentito prosegue il direttore generale che parte dallintera squadra perch i giocatori sono i primi a volere sempre al proprio fianco i tifosi siamo certi che i nostri sostenitori avranno la maturit giusta per saper cogliere questa occasione ed ascoltare la nostra voce abbiamo bisogno del loro sostegno anche in trasferta e questo il momento giusto per dimostrare che i napoletani possono seguire la loro squadra del cuore in tutta italia

8594976 but were confident with our experience our team and our existing base of fans
8594977 we shortened the series from six to three months and have created weekly installments of the show to make it easier for passive viewers to engage with the show
8594978 there are international rights dvds and other markets that are very new but our first goal is to produce really compelling content and to worry about the monetization later
8594979 certo nel calcio le insidie si nascondono ovunque chiaro che sarei sciocco a vedere ostacoli insormontabili dopo un 3 0 a nostro favore per va anche detto che ci tengo molto a vedere limpegno da parte di tutti non servirebbe a nulla prendere la gara alla leggera e poi rischiare di andare in difficolt e complicarsi la vita chi gioca deve dare il massimo i ragazzi lo sanno
8594980 non so valuter bene poco prima della gara di certo ci sono giocatori che vorrei vedere allopera anche per testare la condizione di tutti poi chiaramente molto dipender dalla piega che prender la gara ma ci che mi preme vedere concentrazione ed attenzione da parte di chi scender in campo dal primo minuto abbiamo la possibilit di sederci al tavolo delle big della coppa uefa e questo per noi sarebbe gi un grande traguardo
8594981 e perch no adesso non so ancora chi giocher ma per lavezzi potrebbe esserci anche spazio non con noi da parecchio tempo ed avr voglia di ben figurare davanti al suo pubblico

8594988 householders are encouraged to contact the environmental health service and seek advice on how to improve their supply
8594989 changes at google may increase coverage and pricing though magnitude unclear
8594990 before you didnt have much visibility into the score itself
8594991 you couldnt tell whether you were at the top or bottom end of the ok or great scale and you couldnt really see how any changes you made would affect it with this granular scale you can make a change and move from 6 to 7 for example and see that your efforts were successful you can also better assess the greatest areas for improvement
8594992 we confirmed with google that theres been no change to the previous algorithm
8594993 they just changed the translation so it doesnt give a real assessment we dont use it as an indicator of an ads true quality
8594994 this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed
8594995 your ads will be more likely to show when theyre relevant and less likely to show when theyre not
8594996 with quality scores now calculated on the fly google may be able to find scenarios in which these inactive bids achieve a high enough score to be served against certain queries
8594997 this change has the potential to move millions of words back into the competitive auction for placement
8594998 probably a little bit more aggressive in decreasing coverage than we ought to have been
8594999 we learned that knowing your minimum bid wasnt always helpful in getting the ad placement you wanted
8595000 so we hope that first page bids will give you better guidance on how to achieve your advertising goals
8595001 the likelihood is that these changes will produce more competition for first page listings resulting in higher cpcs
8595002 by allowing people to see what it will cost them to appear on the first page you are giving them the push to bid to that level some will shy away and save their spend but to others it will be the carrot they need to make the next step
8595003 i think its going to be a significant price inflation point as now youll have to guess whether youve spent enough just to show up
8595004 and im not saying that thats the best strategy but eliminating the conservative tools may negatively impact revenue and new advertiser growth
8595005 we believe that googles decision to replace minimum bids with first page bids should over time have an inflationary effect on average pricing for certain keywords
8595006 we believe that placement on page 1 search results is an important priority for keyword advertisers by improving transparency in the process for determining which bids will yield page 1 placement we expect many advertisers will adjust their minimum bids higher in order to compete for that placement
8595007 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
8595008 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
8595009 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
8595010 there have been a lot of changes but they are very patchy its still not a transitional economy
8595011 certain segments or layers are allowed to adopt some market driven mechanisms but the majority of the economy is being artificially preserved
8595012 its the level of specificity in the ideology thats the problem for reform
8595013 if your guiding principles were vague and adaptable it would be easier but in north korea they have official guidelines on how to do proper ostrich farming how can you now say in fact thats not the right way to do ostrich farming
8595014 north koreans were taught their whole lives that the state would provide now they have to take care of themselves
8595015 a mistake of just one word can lead a north korean to be publicly executed in this society
8595016 it is impossible to resist publicly the regime the control and suppression are beyond our imagination slaughter is still being carried out in north korea

8595028 my assumption would be that if we could actually stabilize iraq in such a way that you do not have warfare between the sunnis the shiias and the kurds some semblance of law and order in that country then i think that there is no doubt that the kerry administration is going to be interested in bringing back the reservists and the national guardsmen who are currently there but
8595029 i think it is also true that the bush administration would bring the troops back
8595030 my 16 month timeline if you examine everything ive said was always premised on making sure our troops were safe
8595031 and my guiding approach continues to be that weve got to make sure that our troops are safe and that iraq is stable and im going to continue to gather information to find out whether those conditions still hold

8595041 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
8595042 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
8595043 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
8595044 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
8595045 its weird to like fake sex and put your parts up against someone elses
8595046 i know that if i ever smoked pot i would probably become like a total pothead because i think i would like that
8595047 i have like a chill personality so thats why im never going to start because i dont like to be dependent on anything i dont even drink coffee
8595048 i would have a very different career right now and im happy where im at
8595049 i was like all right man im ready i was eager that was great because i just sort of was fueled you know
8595050 she came up to my dressing room and she was crying and she was like im so proud of you
8595051 i dont get showtime so i dont have any great reference for him and so when he came in to see us last november we couldnt believe that there was this guy who was so charismatic and such a good actor and then when he opened his mouth and sang for us all the little hairs on our arms stood up
8595052 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8595053 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the center of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8595054 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs
8595055 silas is totally opposite of me and also not as smart as melchior

8595079 del martin and phyllis lyon defined love devotion and constancy
8595080 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8595081 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8595082 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has lost one of its bravest and most admired activists
8595083 del martin dared for decades to fight to marry her beloved phyllis and by doing so became an iconic hero the lgbt community her death is a great loss to all of us but her life is an inspiration
8595084 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor
8595085 she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible when faced with moments of fatigue laziness or weakness one had only to ask what would del and phyllis do while she will be greatly missed her legacy will be cherished forever

8595090 the people of debary are asking for resignation of you and maryann courson give the city notice we intend to sue
8595091 everyone is subject to the law even websites and blogs
8595092 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8595093 but when they publish things that are libellous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for skmm to act
8595094 the commission and the government should acknowledge that the problem at hand is the failure of the mainstream media to fulfil its duties in reporting information adequately truthfully and fairly and not go on a witch hunt of content providers in cyberspace which holds the only meaningful free space for critical and challenging expression in malaysia
8595095 the use of jail as an intermediate sanction was correlated with higher rates of recidivism a relationship that should be examined more closely
8595096 of the 30 percent of the supervised population who were sanctioned 92 percent received jail time at some point during their supervision
8595097 most people 70 percent did not receive any type of sanction or intervention while on probation or under post prison supervision in multnomah county
8595098 seg n la p gina web oficial al 30 de junio pasado la deuda trep a 4
8595099 debe tenerse en cuenta que la deuda fue pesificada y que el capital en gran proporci n no sufri importantes actualizaciones esto significa que el crecimiento del pasivo se debe a compromisos de esta gesti n
8595100 cabe resaltar que el organismo de contralor acostumbraba emitir un acuerdo bimestral sobre el monitoreo de la deuda p blica pero desconozco las razones por las cuales dej de dictar ese instrumento desde hace m s de un a o es m s la ltima acordada sobre la cuesti n ya no publica los anexos sobre endeudamiento p blico que elaboran los profesionales del organismo
8595101 los contadores fiscales denunciaban all los conceptos del pasivo que no eran expuestos como deuda tambi n se refer an a partidas compensadas con valores activos inexistentes y sin criterios v lidos todas esas maniobras s lo buscaban disimular la magnitud con que esta gesti n comprometi el patrimonio de los tucumanos
8595102 para reconstruir el sue o americano y restablecer el liderazgo de estados unidos en el mundo con m s diplomacia y menos unilateralismo
8595103 anoche hillary nos dijo muy claramente que ella har todo lo posible a favor de la elecci n de obama ya somos dos en realidad ya somos 18 millones
8595104 quiero que todos los que apoyaron a hillary voten por obama en noviembre
8595105 es una naci n con problemas en dos frentes el sue o americano est bajo sitio y el liderazgo de estados unidos en el mundo se ha debilitado
8595106 demasiado unilateralismo y fracasar en el uso del poder de la diplomacia
8595107 es un buen hombre que sirvi al pa s heroicamente y sufri terriblemente en vietnam pero en las cuestiones fundamentales todav a abraza la filosof a extrema republicana
8595108 los republicanos dec an que yo era demasiado joven y demasiado inexperto para comandante en jefe
8595109 les suena familiar ese argumento no funcion en 1992 porque est bamos en el lado correcto de la historia y no funcionar en 2008 porque obama est en el lado correcto de la historia
8595110 si no estoy equivocado hillary sacudi el edificio el martes

8595112 this is a designated illegal activity zone if you want to do anything illegal please keep within the boundaries marked by the tape the psb thanks you for your cooperation and by the way my brother in law would like two tickets for the taekwondo on saturday thanks very much
8595113 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
8595114 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
8595115 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
8595116 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
8595117 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
8595118 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
8595119 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
8595120 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
8595121 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
8595122 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
8595123 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
8595124 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
8595125 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
8595126 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8595127 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8595128 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8595129 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8595130 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8595131 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8595132 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8595133 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8595134 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race

8595142 although we are technically the newest university in britain at the current time we have a heritage spanning almost 150 years through our founder institutions
8595143 all the things that most evaluators think are intangibles we think are very tangible toughness work ethic football iq leadership love for the game thats one of the reasons new england won all those championships they find those guys so we think they are very quantifiable too
8595144 ive been doing this for 16 years he might be as special as any player ive been around when hes in the huddle everyone knows it he has that thing about him at the end of last octobers akron game he just said lets do this temple won on a late touchdown drive some leaders are vocal others lead by example he can do it all he transcends all social economic groups and ethnic relationships it doesnt matter thats what makes him unique
8595145 coming from a guy whos been around college football and is really up and coming it makes you want to do some things for him and the program this year
8595146 i basically chose temple for a challenge when i first talked to coach golden he said the same thing we sort of clicked right there and then
8595147 i cant explain it any other way its like a kid waking up on christmas morning or riding a bike for the first time that kind of feeling
8595148 you just want to help your teammates in any way necessary i talked to the other quarterbacks when i could let them know what i was seeing out there nobody wants to sit around i spent the away games in my dorm room watching online on the internet it was different
8595149 i think the team gained some valuable experience as other guys stepped up we can build from that but being out once was enough for me
8595150 all i can do is my part i like the pressure of having some expectations with our defense if we put some points up well turn some ifs into more wins
8595151 when i found out i wasnt too happy about that
8595152 the only thing you can do is use that as motivation were not going to change our approach to anything we do hopefully its going to work out the way we think it will
8595153 a quarterback has to play and be smart at the same time i cant try to make the big play all the time ive got the easy job i just throw the ball the other guys have to run and hit and get tired

8595167 traders can take this as a warning or a suggestion its up to them
8595168 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8595169 john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades weve traveled the world together and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amaze me
8595170 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8595171 john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time
8595172 were not going to let what happened in the past such as swift boating a reference to unanswered attacks on john kerrys war record in the 2004 presidential campaign happen to this team
8595173 joe biden is a guy whos going to roll up his sleeves and throw punches when they need to be thrown
8595174 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure america cannot afford four more years of this
8595175 we will hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild
8595176 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8595177 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8595178 mine began in scranton pennsylvania and then wilmington delaware with a dad who fell on hard times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up
8595179 he is underperforming kerry by a net of 12 percentage points among white noncollege democrats and 9 points among white democratic men
8595180 this entire democratic convention has been devoted to winning over whites over 50 and thats why biden was picked
8595181 i think biden will have an effect on obama i think obama will find a more comfortable language for doing this its hard for him because hes just not an instinctive populist he doesnt look angry
8595182 whether you want to call it whites over 50 or blue collar whites or older blue collar whites were talking about one group and either he connects with them or he doesnt
8595183 if he clears the hurdle he can win big if he doesnt were looking at a photo finish
8595184 barack obamas style and essence did not go over well with blue collar caucasian democratic voters because he speaks a beautiful english and has lofty lexicon they think hes just not one of them hes a smart guy who went to college some of it may be race
8595185 with biden on the ticket together they can work off each other
8595186 we married my mom jill they together rebuilt our family
8595187 and 36 years later he still makes that trip so even though dad worked in washington hes never been part of washington he always sounded like the kid from scranton pennsylvania he is

8595222 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8595223 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8595224 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8595225 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8595226 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader

8595232 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8595233 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8595234 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8595235 everyone is subject to the law even web sites and blogs
8595236 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8595237 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8595238 intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves
8595239 but when they publish things that are libelous slanderous or defamatory it is natural for authorities to act
8595240 we dont want all out war with russia theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8595241 the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8595242 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8595243 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8595244 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8595245 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8595246 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
8595247 sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8595248 we will expand our line up of products with displays at 40 inches or larger as demand for them is on the rise
8595249 while riding my sister like a rented mule think of me you ignorant fool
8595250 nearly 100 of the groundwater within the mallee is salty as buggery no doubt about it
8595251 a lot of the work we do in the mallee is keeping the fresh salt balance apart so its dealing with salinity issues that arise from groundwater discharge either into the river or into wetlands or where it might be for one reason or another rising through the landscape causing havoc so its a major risk
8595252 it is clear that many of our groundwater resources are over used as such groundwater levels continue to fall past acceptable levels and this is clearly not sustainable there seems to be little will to address this vital matter and arguments of adverse economic impacts abound reducing groundwater use to sustainable levels must be a key national priority
8595253 effective management of groundwater cant be achieved with the current organisational arrangements within government
8595254 groundwater offers a serious new water resource in some parts of australia while in other parts it is over developed and in need of greatly improved management
8595255 often whats not understood is that when you stand at some rivers and lakes and look at them what youre seeing there isnt just a surface water thing but some of that water in many cases is coming from groundwater
8595256 if we over pump the adjacent aquifer and lower the water tables its possible that in some cases and there are examples of this certainly overseas where streams can run dry due to just over pumping the adjacent aquifer
8595257 people that have historically had good access to surface water dams are now looking at ensuring their supply through a domestic and stock bore
8595258 obviously the ongoing drought is seeing surface water systems dry up or have less reliability and that is increasing the pressure on the groundwater resources so with that comes pressures on licensing and ensuring that people that are seeking to go ahead with a groundwater licence arent interfering on other people that already have a licence in place
8595259 we are looking at long term sustainability and ensuring that the aquifer isnt extracted past a certain point
8595260 isnt plentiful it is a relatively small proportion of the total volume of water used but in some parts of the state its very important particularly in the south west
8595261 groundwater extraction has to be licensed it has to be metered money is collected from groundwater users to pay for the administration of the system were spending money on things like the state observation bore network were spending money on management plans
8595262 co authored works will be considered to the extent that the candidates contribution can be separately evaluated
8595263 i supported him enthusiastically in 2000 but hes hired the same people who ran him into the ground last time to run his campaign
8595264 its absolutely stupid that were pouring out that kind of money and getting nothing for it
8595265 theres no jobs created no taxes paid and no profit made
8595266 we should have never gotten that vulnerable to that kind of a problem
8595267 the governments going to have to provide corridors to transmit the wind energy to the east and west coast
8595268 you need to put in a 10 year production tax credit
8595269 both republicans and democrats understand that this is not a partisan issue
8595270 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
8595271 when you say wind solar and tide most every expert that i know says that if you maximize that in every possible way the contribution that that would make given the present state of technology is very small is very small its not a large contribution the truly clean technologies dont work
8595272 hell and high water global warming the solution and the politics
8595273 i guess he did us a favor he woke up a sleeping giant obviously
8595274 i dont care when a player does whatever he wants
8595275 but when a player starts pointing into the dugout like he was doing and saying the things he was saying a guy who respects the game like myself doesnt appreciate it i had to let him know
8595276 you dont have to do stupid things like that i just had to let him know i didnt appreciate it he was still yelling and talking crap and running away i wanted him to stop and face me
8595277 our guys got upset about it im not sure what he did i know the umpires didnt like it

8595288 the numbers are misleading because you need to take into account everything that workers are earning including substantially more in health care and retirement plans
8595289 the official unemployment rate understated how difficult it was to find a job in the 2000s
8595290 the u s jobs creation machine came to a screeching halt after the 2001 recession and barely picked up steam in the recovery
8595291 the economy of the 2000s has been like shampoo instructions bubble bust repeat
8595292 we need to generate growth thats sustainable not on bubbles
8595293 unemployment is high compared to the late 90s but not the 80s
8595294 its not unusually high especially when you consider that the labor force hasnt grown as rapidly this decade as it did in the 90s
8595295 this is coming from people who werent in the top 1 before
8595296 bill gates jeff bezos the google founders it looks like theyre getting more than their share but its actually something else theyre all setting new high standards
8595297 there was a vast disconnect in what people earned with what they produced
8595298 we contend daily with the challenge of figuring out who and what to trust online
8595299 the internet has yet to achieve its full potential because we cannot tell the fraudsters from our friends in 2008 comodo has worked hard to combat this problem
8595300 in an environment of increasing threats we must empower all stakeholders within the internet with tools to deliver the right authentication information quickly at the point of need to protect users and critical assets
8595301 the trusted internet initiative addresses the industrys and publics most pressing needs for trusted online interactions it introduces new security and authentication technologies to increase the power of the internet to improve the lives of millions of people
8595302 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8595303 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8595304 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8595305 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8595306 we are concerned about blurring the lines between who is an aid worker and who is a soldier
8595307 if we are mistaken for soldiers in very dangerous situations we can become targets
8595308 we too are a face of america overseas and a very positive one and our work through civilians enables america to show a positive side of how we can help others around the world
8595309 unnecessary and inappropriate and poses dangers for our operations down the road
8595310 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
8595311 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
8595312 i really havent been told anything as of right now im going to take it and see how it goes im trying to get better im trying to get healthy im very concerned about our game a week from sunday and thats all im worried about
8595313 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8595314 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8595315 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down

8595322 are busy characters necessarily the same as characters taking actions are activity and action the same must all actions and activities be aimed at goals at what the characters want
8595323 an action has a purpose behind it a goal that has been made meaningful for the audience
8595324 something a character does in a scene in pursuit of a goal that we dont care about

8595326 when you look at stuff from the air it makes you look at the big picture
8595327 with a motor glider we dont have to go out and come back in the lift but rather we can go out and motor to it
8595328 people usually like to come back to where they left and for a glider ride business that can be key
8595329 if something goes wrong on a gliders takeoff theres usually plenty of runway left to bring it back down
8595330 when something goes wrong and takes your attention the possibility of not coming back to where you were is greater
8595331 so checklists become very important as they allow you to stay and remain focused
8595332 i cant believe were finally able to leave for medical treatment
8595333 i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when they tore down those first few bricks this has been a huge victory of people over power
8595334 it is not power that corrupts but fear fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it

8595350 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8595351 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8595352 saying i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8595358 its massively overcrowded its cattle class there just arent enough carriages first thing in the morning
8595359 not all of the trains are full length for the station so they could extend those or run more trains more often
8595360 the 8am and 8 30am trains are always busy but i dont get any of my customers moaning about it
8595361 i think its probably a case of them being comfortably numb
8595362 the main thing to remember is we have a tremendous frequency of service so if somebody felt they didnt want to get on a particular train they could get on another one very soon afterwards
8595363 surbiton station is not the problem in the past 10 years its come on fantastically and it has the capacity
8595364 we need longer trains though and that means longer platforms including at waterloo
8595365 once youve got that you can work down to the other stations such as kingston and new malden which can only handle shorter trains
8595366 work is also soon to start on the old eurostar platforms to increase capacity at waterloo
8595367 negotiations have broken down and strike action will go ahead first group are making huge profits while their workers are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living in one of the worlds most expensive cities

8595369 the choice of this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8595370 the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8595371 john mccain is my friend its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amaze me
8595372 senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear
8595373 on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8595374 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8595375 the fact is al qaida and the taliban the people who actually attacked us on 9 11 have regrouped in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks
8595376 today that american dream feels as if its slowly slipping away i dont need to tell you that
8595377 hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild
8595378 who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8595379 one of the fundamental principles of the bus is that there is no such thing as a dumb question
8595380 you think i could survive if i didnt wed never be forgiven id have to hire a food taster somebody to start my car in the morning
8595381 the fact is that the taliban now has pretty good insight into where were picking up information and how were developing it into actionable intelligence
8595382 the gruesome incident prompted hundreds of afghans in the affected area to take to the streets chanting anti america slogans
8595383 the taliban deliberately fed bogus intelligence to the united states
8595384 the united states and nato should get out and let the regional powers help afghanistan deal with its problems that means pakistan india russia and iran
8595385 the leaders of china kazakhstan kyrgyzstan russia tajikistan and uzbekistan were due to discuss regional economic and security ties along with afghan president hamid karzai and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad

8595387 i wanted right off the bat to let the family know what had happened especially kevin because i worked with him in a platoon and i knew that he and the family all needed to know what had happened
8595388 i was quite appalled that when i was actually able to speak with kevin i was ordered not to tell him
8595389 oneal told house oversight and government reform committee chairman henry waxman
8595390 and he made it known i would get in trouble sir if i spoke with kevin on it being fratricide

8595398 dont argue with me im the parent and i said no
8595399 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining the more responsibility we take in afghanistan the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly
8595400 unless the next american president builds on the existing commitments to help lift the afghan people out of extreme poverty and protect civilians it will be impossible for the country to achieve lasting peace
8595401 send celine dion there as a good will ambassador ok thats really an act of war
8595402 weve spent years talking about the value of the water cooler conversations
8595403 now we have the ability to actually understand what these relationships are how information and decision making migrate we see how people really work
8595404 you do not have to check snopes to determine if this is true or false watch and listen to obamas own words
8595405 how will you protect the american people without a powerful defence sic r amp d is mandatory to keep ahead of the threats and develop new and better ways to support and protect our troops when they go in harms sic way
8595406 wow so thats where all my money is going man we are over kill when it come sic to producing a lot of weapons for this country
8595407 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8595408 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8595409 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8595410 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8595411 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8595412 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8595413 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8595414 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8595415 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8595416 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8595417 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8595418 launches the new record with a false start that gives way to fervent ferocity
8595419 and then it kicks in and your entire car blows up we wanted to come out blow them away just shut people up and in doing that we u2019ve made the beginning of the record very memorable

8595423 f r die beamten ist es nat rlich angenehmer wenn kein l stiger anwalt dabei ist
8595424 wer dieses spiel nicht ernst nimmt bekommt es mit mir zu tun
8595425 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8595426 haha who did say that you know my mum gets that bill too and she just refuses to pay for it so actually you dont have to pay for it either
8595427 theyre used to watching shows on a 2 by 3 inch screen theres a click to enlarge button and only about 5 use it
8595428 was when we had a focus group of 18 to 22 year olds and a third of them didnt have cable tv theyre just starting out they have limited resources and its more important to them to have a good internet connection
8595429 this generation doesnt see watching programs as a passive experience
8595430 so interactivity is a major part of our plan viewers can play games or answer trivia questions at the bottom of the screen while they watch if theyre at work they can do spreadsheets they can link in their friends to watch at the same time
8595431 and as with any business we hope to become profitable
8595432 we felt like a year ago at this time missouri was a great football team but it might be later in the year before everyone else realized how good they were
8595433 anytime you have a great quarterback like chase daniel we knew he potentially was a great player but he didnt even come onto the scene until our game
8595434 i said after the game last year what a great team illinois was and they ended up in the rose bowl
8595435 the first game you want to start to see the personality of your team i like what ive seen but until youre in competition out on the field by yourself into the moment and having to deal with three and a half hours of football until you see it you dont really know how do you come out of halftime whats your attitude throughout the game what kind of toughness to you play with you want to see what kind of makeup they have
8595436 i have a few more gray hairs than when i started
8595437 if i helped you start a part time business and then you got to retire two years later would you send me a thank you card
8595438 as far as our commitment is concerned obviously basketball was a key component to this
8595439 were going to triple our games that are available on espn and espn2 were going to add a regular game on espnu were going to have a regular season game on espn on abc the conference tournament semifinals and championship obviously on espn and abc as well
8595440 so were very excited about boosting distribution and exposure for sec basketball
8595441 i think it really speaks highly of the people in the conference office and their vision and diligence toward getting something done that obviously is monumental for our league
8595442 i am very excited and look forward to being part of the best tv package in college sports by far
8595443 i never worried about it some guys in our league the pac 10 complained about the tv deal
8595444 this thing is all based off recruiting you look at all of the first round picks out of the pac 10 this year those kids thought it was a pretty good league
8595445 to see the soldiers in that setting and gain some insight and understanding into what they go through makes our jobs seem like gravy we think we have problems with recruiting and scheduling and its nothing compared to what those guys go through and they keep such a positive attitude
8595446 im going to petition the ncaa to see if the five wins over there can count on my schedule
8595447 two of them were from texas and said they were going to try to come see my team play
8595448 everybody in the country knows the history of fresno state
8595449 from people i know who are more familiar with west coast football they say this is pats best team in 10 years
8595450 its not exactly what i was looking to do right out of the gate because i knew he had a very good football team
8595451 we were trying to find a division i a opponent and there werent many out there and one thing led to another and we ended up with a game
8595452 its a good chance to see how good we are
8595453 im the same guy as a head coach as i was an assistant im not going to get all hyped up and charge out of that helmet and trip and fall and embarrass myself
8595454 hes probably our most valuable player outside of patrick white hes a backup running back the starting slot hes a kick returner he has a great head on shoulders he could probably go in there and play quarterback were going to do more than throw bubble screens to him were going to try to get the ball to him downfield were going to get the ball to jock sanders somehow hes going to be exciting
8595455 that wasnt a very good night thats for sure that was a long night
8595456 right out of the box the guys understand the importance of it theyve talked about it all year long and theyve talked about it in training camp im sure its the same situation over in lexington right now i like opening up with this game
8595457 i would not be surprised if all three played at certain times
8595458 the great thing about our new quarterback is that we have a veteran offense around him with receivers who know where theyre supposed to be a veteran offensive line that can give him some protection and guidance and veteran backs that can carry the football were going to ask him to do the things that we need from the quarterback spot but not to do anything that theyre not capable of doing
8595459 what im looking for is leadership a guy that can control the football team and who guys will look up to
8595460 and if thats both of them then itll be both of them but i think it will eventually work its way out we have two good guys that are so close and sometimes when you have a quarterback battle with two people a lot of people say you must not have one and i think this is totally different both these guys have earned the right to play some
8595461 theres more chemistry and i guess unselfishness this year than there was even two years ago when we won the national championship we might not have the talent that we had two years ago but well be much more unselfish close and together thats whats going to bring us over the hump thats where we werent last year not enough guys had played there wasnt the experience we didnt have the same camaraderie as we do now
8595462 the fans expect us to win the national championship now but i think thats a little unrealistic at this point
8595463 michigan made a lot of mistakes on offense that threw off the whole offense but at one point they were rolling then they kind of let up off of them and appalachian state never stopped their motors never stopped they were hungry so if we get up by a touchdown or five touchdowns weve got to keep pounding them
8595464 we didnt have many guys last year but those guys stayed together from spring camp through the season this year weve juggled them around more than we did all last year put together
8595465 you have to be able to adjust our game plan has a lot of adjustment in it were going to try and be as flexible as we can without confusing our kids there are a lot of unknowns youve got a quarterback starting that you have to go back and look at san diego state film or junior college film to see him you have to look at several different teams to see what you think theyre going to be doing offensively and then you have to look at ucla film to see the personnel its a little bit different but regardless of what the situation is you have to be ready to play
8595466 i can understand why the fans and the media wouldnt know what to expect because in some respects the coaches dont either
8595467 we would know a lot more because weve been around practice i dont want to say were going into this thing totally blind because were not weve been practicing for several weeks now
8595468 but until you put them in a game situation youre not certain how guys are going to react particularly the guys that have not played not just the freshmen but there are some sophomores and upperclassmen that are just now getting their first opportunity to play significant amounts
8595469 i would think both have gotten to the point where we feel comfortable we could win with both of them
8595470 he has an instinct to run to daylight fast thats a good running back instinct so it makes him a little bit like a running back because hes able to get up to speed fast hes an explosive runner for a guy who is 6 6 like the guys weve seen in the olympics
8595471 you got to deal with the cards youre dealt weve had one year starters at other positions its just the quarterback obviously gets a lot of attention allan evridge has done the most to earn this right to start and thats where hes going to be
8595472 this is the last go around for many of us many of us werent part of a bowl game and weve not won a bowl game around here since 1949 so we the seniors are pulling from the top and getting guys to go in the same direction were going to win a lot of games this year
8595473 the increased testosterone can have energy boosting effects in women
8595474 when theyre against the cervix prostaglandins help it dilate and induce natural labor
8595475 the more you have sex the more likely youll be to continue to produce testosterone one of the primary hormones responsible for sexual desire
8595476 when things go well in the bed and youre pleasing your partner
8595477 you feel more confident and powerful in other parts of your life
8595478 that bottle of wine or chocolate bar will taste even better
8595479 when people are together long term sex can become boring
8595480 coming up with new ways to keep things interesting improves the imagination

8595483 is that advisable seems to me you guys are trying to chase the enjera with water you are bound to starve after an hour
8595484 so colorful if only it wasnt a bad idea for lunch
8595485 the ferenjis eat tomatoe salad before lunch to work an appetite same with guys and hangovers with enjera youd only produce acid better eat it later
8595486 and we are having that tomatoe salad i know you love
8595487 but i thought that would be chasing the enjera with water
8595488 either i give the wrong impressions when i talk or people willingly misunderstand me so id be easier to label

8595500 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8595501 we are going to be moving to mile high stadium tomorrow and i want to let you know why at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back i think we are going to have a great night tomorrow night and i look forward to seeing you there
8595502 you can learn an awful lot about a man obama campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8595503 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8595504 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8595505 this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure american cannot afford four more years of this failure

8595564 the ultimate benefactor of that money is the democratic party
8595565 my philosophy on campaign finance is when things are disclosed voters get to make educated decisions
8595566 if the state party wants to disclose the source of donations even further that would certainly be fine with me
8595567 my first question when i hear this is why wasnt i invited
8595568 big money gets into the system in any number of ways and this is just another way

8595615 with the global credit crunch and bear market entering its second year and with little end in sight we believe this is placing ongoing pressure on macquaries businesses and outlook
8595616 there are still eight brokers with buy recommendations on the stock so there is a high risk of more cuts to recommendations and earnings estimates
8595617 judging by the knee jerk reaction to the ubs report people are voting with their feet

8595657 bond went into limbo for seven years for many reasons but one was that it didnt feel relevant any more

8595679 i am going to stop using birth control just letting you know
8595680 your stalling on kids has me feeling bitter like you married me under false pretenses
8595681 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8595682 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8595683 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8595684 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8595685 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8595686 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8595687 was gesturing in the wrong direction it had to be moved
8595688 risky for me the piece is more like a conversation
8595689 im interested in the process but theres also content my love of history of nostalgia represented in sea of birds by my mothers story finally there is the thematic element the philosophical question of balancing engagement with detachment
8595690 we tend to focus on what happens lifes events but what happens in the space in between matters too
8595691 to grow you have to take a risk the question is how much of that risk do you want to show the public
8595692 now ive made a show about someone important to me this aesthetic is bigger and more beautiful
8595693 this is the second time and it is a record for the history of the festival we have five american films in competition
8595694 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america
8595695 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them i want to be like that
8595696 everyone from a senator can enjoy it to a bum on the street its available to everyone
8595697 were making more art for the people rather than the super high end stuff
8595698 this is the festival to get into to present your work
8595699 in 12 years weve championed a large group of artists
8595700 weve consistently given them a platform weve enabled them to find legs
8595701 the arts community in philadelphia becomes part of an international community
8595702 enriches our work here because our work feeds into other experiences
8595703 it creates a lot of buzz in the city and theres an urgency to seeing the pieces
8595704 allows me to see shows at an inexpensive price or a reasonable one and i get to choose from a lot of different dramatic offerings
8595705 the opportunity to see new work its exciting what an amazing arts community
8595706 the idea is to take a chance its not always going to be great and its not always going to be memorable but it is always interesting
8595707 created a vibe for a mainstream audience to see the work we do
8595708 you can feel normal taking a risk and checking out unusual stuff you may not know you already like
8595709 the fringe is a whole other way to get people involved in a conversation about art
8595710 at other festivals i saw that what people really wanted each night was to just be together at a place where they could talk
8595711 to do your own thing thats the spirit of the fringe
8595712 the sophistication and the willingness to push the envelope i find that very attractive
8595713 the most important thing whether youre talking about a business or youre talking about a city is innovation you want to create a climate of innovation
8595714 the shows we make are being seen by the national and international community and taken to theaters and festivals worldwide
8595715 so many of us in philadelphia are cross disciplinary so you might be designing one persons show and performing in another persons
8595716 the festival means pushing ourselves youre encouraged to do risky work to go out on a limb and you get to see a whole range of different people taking risks nick stuccio has given us such an international face
8595717 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8595718 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now

8595722 it is totally possible to have hair that straight without having a relaxer
8595723 the key is in the products and the tools that are being used
8595724 if one were to have the shoes one actually needed as basics one would indeed have black brown and navy shoes of varying heel heights both summer and winter
8595725 then theres dressy versus casual or day versus night or weekday versus weekend
8595726 theres not an important substantive issue in city government that doesnt pass by or run through the city solicitors office
8595727 is not about their value to the community its about discriminatory behavior by people who get a benefit from the city
8595728 we have a disturbing level of gun violence in this city
8595729 while people have the right to own guns under certain circumstances that right is not unlimited
8595730 i dont get into all the drama and hyperbole of these cases
8595731 all the negative scrutiny of the administration the lawyers in this office were feeling really underappreciated
8595732 this is an easy cheerleading assignment even for someone like me who wasnt peppy enough to put on a short skirt wave pom poms in the air and do splits
8595733 you wont get the kind of opportunity responsibility and autonomy to practice law that you have in this office i love it its the most fun you can have as a lawyer
8595734 i dont have a lot of tolerance for nonsense or stupidity
8595735 when i have to confront it im impatient about it i know where all the bodies are buried and i know how you bury them
8595736 gets frustrated like we all do when people dont perform well shes very exacting
8595737 shelley will know the kind of grape used for an obscure wine or the capital of some country most people have never heard of
8595738 i cant remember if i ever played trivial pursuit with shelley or whether its just a nightmare
8595739 cary grant tells her youll never be a first class woman until you learn to have some regard for human frailty im not anywhere near as harsh as she is but i identify with her struggle to learn how to be herself and let herself go
8595740 she understands what it is to be in the trenches

8595763 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8595764 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8595765 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8595766 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8595767 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8595768 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8595769 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8595770 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses

8595772 i think we can safely say that this is the first long distance car journey in europe that has relied on restaurants and burger bars as an informal network of filling stations
8595773 its true we spent a lot of time fat finding knocking on the doors of restaurants begging for their waste but it worked and the beauty of course is that when such supplies are collected straight from a restaurant and used as fuel they have a zero carbon footprint
8595774 we used what is known as an oily bits centrifuge system the worlds first mobile purification system for cars to filter the waste en route
8595775 i think we made quite a lot of converts along the way

8595797 while we are very fortunate to not have witnessed the full extent of tropical storm fay there has been considerable damage to roads homes and farmlands
8595798 our goal is to assist these counties with state equipment and personnel in order to handle extensive repairs
8595799 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8595800 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8595801 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario

8595816 obviously i dont just come to the races to commentate for television or watch how my team is doing i know it is very difficult but i still have small hopes that i can be racing again

8595818 goldman sachs is a leading private equity and real estate investor with a long history of making profitable investments and gs infrastructure partners is a natural extension of that business
8595819 s trings are being pulled by major multinational water companies with a very specific agenda to make water an economic commodity that is bought and sold on global markets and is managed by transnational companies that claim to be more efficient flexible and cheaper than public water agencies
8595820 arrayed against this corporate planned water future is a growing citizens movement of community groups and nongovernmental organizations these people believe water is a human right they want to work toward solving the worlds serious water problems not by empowering corporations but by empowering local people
8595821 the city of reno has been approached by goldman sachs regarding a long term asset leasing prospect that could potentially generate significant cash for the three tmwa entities the program would allow tmwa to lease its assets for 50 years and receive an up front cash payment
8595822 given the current difficult economic times that have forced operational cut backs and service reductions within all three owner entities it is critical that all potentially viable revenue generating prospects be analyzed to determine their true feasibility
8595823 i dont think you want to cause anything that would cause these folks to back away at the last minute
8595824 throw ing a new player into the mix when the three entities work well together
8595825 again what we feel as staff the owner entities have a fiduciary responsibility to take a look at potential revenue generating processes
8595826 to reject it on the face of it is unreasonable
8595827 there is however a limited window of opportunity to maximize the amount of cash that could be received through this prospect
8595828 this is a bizarre morning for me because i woke up and read an editorial in the gazette journal and actually agreed with it
8595829 didnt want us to sell to a private business and was afraid that the rates would go up too much
8595830 well we killed it and i havent heard anybody has the appetite to do that revive the measure because of the public outcry
8595831 vidlers strategy is simple the west is dry so buy up as much water as possible sit back and see just how high the price will go the more water vidler sells the more money it makes which is to say vidlers business plan is in direct contradiction to water wise development and conservation progress
8595832 somewhat unusual vidler acquires water rights and interests and effectively releases or resells them vidler expects it will transfer agricultural water rights to urban centers one could argue that vidler seems to rest on a flimsy legalistic base a state government could pass laws that help reallocate water in a more efficient manner on the other hand history shows thats a tough goal to achieve state governments in the west have fought over water rights for over 100 years
8595833 the company believes that continued growth in water demand will generate rate adjustments to its water contract prices that meet or exceed the rate of inflation while the value of its underlying resources may continue to appreciate
8595834 i didnt quite know what to do with it if it did result in an advisory question it wasnt highly defined who would be directed would the county be directed would the cities would regional planning there were a lot of unanswered questions
8595835 in their own testimony i believe the proponents blurred the lines between the two questions
8595836 you know someone would come up to testify on one and would wind up testifying on the other so there was a lot of confusion as to that
8595837 i try to take care in my voting so that we dont have a ridiculously crowded ballot with ballot questions because its a turn off to voters theres a lot of research to do
8595838 shall the truckee meadows regional plan be amended to reflect and to include a policy or policies requiring that local government land use plans be based upon and in balance with identified and sustainable water resources available within washoe county

8595847 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between websites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do

8595876 we clarified some things that have been a source of confusion for students so we tried to offer helpful guides to students about policy procedures
8595877 our expectation is that well see fewer appeals because a student will have another venue to go to
8595878 we have certainly worked with the police before and will continue to do so were very concerned about the safety of our residents
8595879 weve gotten involved in community meetings such as partners against crime and other organizations that focus on safety

8595881 a desire to isolate subject matter from the visual clutter around us
8595882 its very difficult to try and find an encompassing theme unless theyre given some assignment which we didnt do and thats why we called it private investigations to suggest that it was left up to the individual
8595883 i think sometimes black and white images reveal shapes and textures that are completely lost with color
8595884 when you think about orson welles and some of the film noir bogart films a lot of times you see textural representations that generally dont come out very well in color representations that maybe more naturally lend themselves to black and white
8595885 el greco to vel zquez art during the reign of philip iii
8595886 this is the first major exhibit of art produced in spain between 1598 and 1621 because there just hasnt been much interest in this era before
8595887 some of these pieces and artists have never been showcased outside of their churches much less in america
8595888 what i was expecting out of my placement was working with the community itself
8595889 i ended up in a sort of umbrella organization that worked as a support for ethnic communities the most interaction i got was with people who came in and were filling out applications or using computers
8595890 we are responding to a need that the community has expressed its no 1 and instrumental
8595891 for me personally it helped me focus my career goals because i used to be pre med and now i feel like i want to go into the teaching career
8595892 sometimes the internships are different from what we think because of changes in personnel organizations realizing what they need and students having different skills
8595893 my hope is that students arent only doing office work but its hard to see that happen
8595894 we knew it was doing something for the organization we were working with but not directly for the community
8595895 hes real laid back from the standpoint that he wants to let his players play
8595896 he had chris paul and jason kidd as point guards who are very intelligent since im a point guard watching them they were running the show out there and coach k was just kind of pointing at them they looked like they had fun playing with him and i cant wait for him get back
8595897 they definitely ran a lot of our transition sets and its fun what the pro guys do with it because you get a different look on how they read stuff and what they do in certain situations
8595898 a lot of the plays that they did run we do run so it definitely helps us as a team
8595899 theyre used to winning these guys are going to come in here and play and theyre going to play their rear ends off anybody we play right now gets our hands full but especially a team like james madison that knows how to win
8595900 theyre going to run the option they are a very multiple offensive football team that can power you or finesse you either one
8595901 the purpose and goal of the newsletter is to provide a snapshot of important information for members of the duke community
8595902 it is based on research weve done over the past year about what people are interested in receiving and how when and in what form they want to receive it
8595903 a large committee studied international communications here about three years ago and one of the main conclusions was that many people who work at duke felt simultaneously overwhelmed with information and yet uninformed about what was going on in the campus
8595904 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful and won a lot people expect you to be perfect
8595905 its like what we havent gone to the final four what we havent won a national championship its very spoiled and it ruins it a little bit really a lot and so part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8595906 at the end of the spain game where most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career at duke
8595907 so whatever you want to do whether it be the student newspaper local national media you can throw all that stuff out it aint going to work
8595908 but our team is going to have fun its going to be represented and were going to have an opportunity to grow just like our olympic team did
8595909 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow

8595914 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8595915 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8595916 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8595917 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8595918 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8595919 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8595920 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8595921 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8595922 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8595923 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated

8595927 do not venture into production without being assured of a potential market as women i want to urge you to use the opportunities which the government is creating
8595928 in this industry you need to work hard in order to have a prospering business start your own projects and use government as a supportive system
8595929 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
8595930 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket

8595934 although terrorism is not practiced in the country the activities of militants can degenerate to that level if not checked and discouraged
8595935 this is because if tolerated the militants can be infiltrated by terrorists from neighbouring countries
8595936 at times my ministry receives complaints from some conservancies of individuals and even conservancy committee members misusing and misappropriating conservancy property and finances at the expense of the conservancy members
8595937 my first observation is that the country must recognise that we now have in the niger delta region a major crisis with potentially perilous implication that will go beyond our national economy if not properly resolved the cisis is the culmination of long years of neglect of the interests of the people of the region and indifference of the ecological consequences of the exploitation of the regions oil and gas resources
8595938 the primary responsibility for this neglect and indiiference lies with our national adninsitrations which have over the years not only controlled proceeds from the main resources of the region but also have allowed multinational oil compaies to operate in the area in a manner that would not be tolerated in more environmental conscious countries
8595939 the response to this national crisis must begin from a clear understanding that the situation which now exist in the niger delta region cannot be resolved through force of arms
8595940 the niger delta region crisis should be treated as a national emergency by the federal government it is to be welcomed that yaradua acknowledged the seriousness of the situation right from the beginning of his administration and accordingly decided to convene a major dialogue of stakeholders on the niger delta
8595941 we hope the agreement will end the differences between the somali leaders
8595942 ten days ago the very existence of tfg was at a critical point the differences were a deciding factor that makes or breaks the transitional period including the peace agreement in djibouti
8595943 the agreement will usher in a new era of optimism and hope for the somalia people
8595944 ever since the broad agreement was reached at the end of the igad led somali national reconciliation conference in 2004 we knew it would not be an easy journey and that is why the au and the international community decided to accompany you morally and materially

8595950 this is an issue national regulators have recommended the european commission to address if you tackle this issue you have to tackle it in eu legislation this is something the european commission will consider in the weeks to come
8595951 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8595952 long haul capacity for winter 2008 09 will decline by 11 percent year on year compared to previous plans to grow by 1 percent and short haul capacity in the same period will decline by 1 percent compared to a previous expectation of 2 percent growth
8595953 it is therefore well placed to deal with what is likely to be a very stormy winter for the airline industry
8595954 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue
8595955 anticipation of a quick rate cut by the ecb now seems to be fading on the back of comments by bank members and this has helped lift the euro away from recent dollar lows
8595956 suggests a more stable dollar in the long run which should help keep overall foreign exchange market volatility low
8595957 the sharp decline in house prices persisted into august as weak buyer confidence and tight lending criteria continued to weigh on the market
8595958 we contend daily with the challenge of figuring out who and what to trust online
8595959 the internet has yet to achieve its full potential because we cannot tell the fraudsters from our friends in 2008 comodo has worked hard to combat this problem
8595960 in an environment of increasing threats we must empower all stakeholders within the internet with tools to deliver the right authentication information quickly at the point of need to protect users and critical assets
8595961 the trusted internet initiative addresses the industrys and publics most pressing needs for trusted online interactions it introduces new security and authentication technologies to increase the power of the internet to improve the lives of millions of people
8595962 oil and gas reservoirs around the world are displaying higher decline rates and with increasing emphasis on maximising resource recovery rates the industry is facing a new world in terms of service intensity and
8595963 in the longer term high energy prices continue to support technically challenging projects
8595964 wherever on this planet ideals of personal freedom and dignity apply there you will find the cultural inheritance of england
8595965 there are many things in life more worthwhile than money one is to be brought up in this our england which is still the envy of less happy lands
8595966 cold heart and bloody hand now rule the english land
8595967 england has already lost the war it is only a matter of having the intelligence to admit it
8595968 bind her grind her burn her with fire cast her ashes into the sea she shall escape she shall aspire she shall arise to make men free she shall arise in a sacred scorn lighting the lives that are yet unborn spirit supernal splendor eternal england
8595969 england with all thy faults i love thee still my country and while yet a nook is left where english minds and manners may be found shall be constrained to love thee
8595970 they that have the power to hurt and will do none they rightly do inherit heavens graces
8595971 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
8595972 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before
8595973 i do not accept the proposition that india can skip the manufacturing stage of development and go from being an
8595974 i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8595975 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8595976 speculation is increasingly centered on former massachusetts gov mitt romney and minnesota gov tim pawlenty although connecticut sen joe lieberman remains an option and is in the final mix
8595977 although officials are preparing for the worst levee board chief david bindewald cautioned that as of wednesday morning gustav remained more than 100 hours from landfall a long time in the life of a hurricane
8595978 he asked the corps and contractors to take an accounting of any sand 3 000 pound rock bags and other supplies they might need so the levee board could order the equipment in time to plug weak spots by the weekend

8595985 op veel plaatsen kan er vrijwel niets worden gedaan om dammen en waterkeringen weerstand te laten bieden tegen een wervelstorm
8595986 over the next five years the european union has said we cannot continue to put that waste 220 000 tonnes into landfill so we have to find another way of dealing with it
8595987 we want to build an energy from waste facility which will produce energy heat and steam that will power turbines and generators and then be sold on to the national grid
8595988 the sale of the assets was an important factor underpinning the aaa rating because it provided flexibility to manage infrastructure priorities to maintain state competitiveness
8595989 there is no budget for it this has been a very drawn out process that has collapsed an hour before it was supposed to be put to the vote
8595990 it has not helped the external view of nsw being a good place for stable long term investment
8595991 governments there go to great lengths to give political and economic certainty to attract investors
8595992 it will be an alternative package that has at its heart securing nsws electricity supplies
8595993 the value of those businesses would be eroded if they remain in the governments hands because if they dont compete and grow they will waste
8595994 it doesnt make a difference whether you are a man or a woman when flying
8595995 the circumstances dont change the weather is the same and the aircraft doesnt know the difference
8595996 even in neighbouring countries such as india women have been airline captains for many years now
8595997 today it was predominantly retail driven except for a few foreign trades like jkh and lioc
8595998 e chiaro adesso che i nostri ottimistici piani per ladozione del protocollo ipv6 sono falliti tuttavia lesaurimento degli indirizzi ipv4 una cosa reale per cui saremo costretti a passare a ipv6
8595999 basandomi sulle nostre analisi con lattuale tasso di adozione siamo lontani 10 o pi anni da una pervasiva diffusione di un doppio stack in grado di supportare contemporaneamente ipv4 e ipv6 detto questo saranno i governi a dover spingere sulladozione del nuovo protocollo
8596000 its like a squad the coxswain is like the point man in the squad
8596001 together all the boats work like a formation we have wedges and formations just like on land
8596002 since this is their first navigation mission they have to come within a half mile of the points
8596003 navigation is a lot harder in the water because you dont have any landmarks to tell you if youre there you just have to trust your equipment
8596004 during boat handling the marines have to be very precise while going very slow it is easy to control the boat while going fast but when you are going very slow every single mistake could be costly to the mission
8596005 everybody can come together and share their views their concerns and come to some sort of means to communicate
8596006 some of the best things i think we do is break time and breakouts you meet people you get cards you make contacts and then you put a name with a face
8596007 we are trying to get ideas of whats going on up north so we can better our training for soldiers coming in
8596008 we really hadnt planned anything big but we figured we could do 100 kilometers around arifjan
8596009 there are only about four of us that ride and we figured well why not make it an event
8596010 the first hour will be as normal the second hour will be a gut check

8596012 as part of governments ten year innovation plan for south africa we intend to improve innovation and invention so that we further enhance entrepreneurs job creation and regional development
8596013 you can play your role by advising youngsters to secure their inventions through copyright and patents advise them on how to write a business plan where to access financial support and point them to institutions such as the national system of innovation
8596014 el problema comienza cuando las empresas de m viles y aquellos que realizan los juegos comienzan a cobrar a los consumidores por los juegos
8596015 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
8596016 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
8596017 this raises particular concerns regarding rnai therapy for wet amd
8596018 but by establishing this link between the treatment for the wet form of amd and the potential harmful effect on the dry form of the disease we can perhaps better understand the mechanisms of both diseases
8596019 i think these results have to be taken with caution because the association effect of tlr3 with amd is very small when compared to the diseases association with some other genes
8596020 and there has been already one study saying there is absolutely no association of the tlr3 genetic variant with amd so this raises a question and a need for further edification it could be that this is just a spurious finding and there is in fact no association with amd
8596021 its our belief that lincoln markets to a different class of people
8596022 the addition of bortezomib velcade resulted in significant prolongation in time to disease progression with a reduction of 52 percent in risk of progression
8596023 there was also a significant prolongation of survival with a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death
8596024 the benefit of velcade was not only observed in good risk patients but also in high risk patients
8596025 we now have a new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients
8596026 we are in a new era in the treatment of myeloma
8596027 we have a new paradigm of relatively easy drugs compared to the usual chemotherapy which is adding to quality of life and longevity in myeloma thats a big deal
8596028 the future with repetitive doses of lower doses of medicine to control the myeloma is clearly surfacing
8596029 its an exciting time in the treatment of myeloma and this treatment represents a significant additional option for patients with myeloma who are not candidates for transplant those who are over 65 or may have other significant illnesses that prevent them from being considered for transplant
8596030 now with all the new treatments we have be it the bone marrow transplant or whether it be the use of the newer drugs the outlook for myeloma patients has improved considerably
8596031 but we are clearly in a situation where we have made substantial progress
8596032 with a significantly greater disc capacity for blu ray discs in comparison to dvd its understandable that the time frame for duplication would be extended as well its for that reason that affordably priced robotic autoloader duplicators make perfect sense for the user with more production than time
8596033 we are excited to bring two world class companies together for this alliance
8596034 we share a passion for serving the small and medium sized business community with outstanding products and customer service its a perfect fit
8596035 icontact is revolutionary everyday we are all constantly encountering spam filters and deleted emails while trying to get our messages across to potential customers icontact provides an easy way to keep track of the performance of email messages with its charts and graphs that are populated in real time
8596036 theyve thought of everything 300 ready to go templates for your message rss feed capabilities open and click through handling bounce back handling and much more we know our customers will never want to be without icontact once theyve employed it
8596037 i disagree with the result reached here but i do so in the belief that my colleagues have helped in some small way to demonstrate the good and earnest values that animate this country values that require america prevail
8596038 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think of those ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8596039 cabinet decisions on banned newspapers and agencies shall have bearing on this tender
8596040 the successful tenderer should at least publish three editions within five working days
8596041 if deemed to be at high or immediate risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks women and their doctors should consider using magnesium sulfate to prevent their child from having cerebral palsy
8596042 we define high risk as threatening delivery prior to 32 weeks
8596043 its too early to know if magnesium sulfate has an overall effect on the incidence rate of cerebral palsy
8596044 overall there was no difference in the two groups people taking telmisartan and those taking placebo
8596045 however we did find a difference in that for those who were in the study longer the drug had an effect compared to those who were in the study for a short time
8596046 these effects have not been seen early after a stroke they may be more delayed
8596047 the follow up time in this study was only two a half years and it may have hurt us
8596048 but this study in itself doesnt say you have to use angiotensin ii receptor blocker early
8596049 other studies have suggested that these drugs may be better for stroke risk reduction but in this study we cant say that
8596050 the two drugs were essentially the same in terms of their ability to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke as well as reducing the risk of heart attack and death after a stroke
8596051 both drugs are equally effective neither drug is superior to the other in terms of reducing a recurrent stroke
8596052 in some patients we may use plavix particularly in those who have cardiac disease and in some patients we may still use this combination of persantine and aspirin choices are helpful since different people respond differently to different medicines
8596053 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8596054 it looks as though the hurricane is on track to inflicting damage
8596055 before we conducted these analyses we knew based on evidence from previous studies that we might expect acceleration in decline on cognitive abilities before death
8596056 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die
8596057 typically when you ask the question how does mental function change with age the older you get its easy to mix up people who are merely old with people who are in fact dying
8596058 illustrates very clearly that there is a certain period before death from so called natural causes where mental function declines at an accelerating pace and while most investigators had thought that this kind of decline begins between three to five years before death this study shows that it in fact can be traced back to a starting point that is a lot earlier than previously thought
8596059 i already know what to expect there since one of our guys blessing hungwe has been there
8596060 i intend to learn as much on how other actors do it so that i can improve on my own act
8596061 how to localize your app with rails new i18n features
8596062 if you have any feedback please feel free to drop me a line also visit blog href where i regularly blog about rails and other stuff
8596063 this demo app and all its contents are licensed under the licence href if you want to use it in ways prohibited by this license please contact me and ask my permission
8596064 no examples here since im too lazy to think of attributes to show all custom error messages
8596065 lately a lot of work has been done by sven blog and sven github to facilitate future internationalization and localization of rails
8596066 this demo app tries to show you how you can use the features that have been implemented so far to localize big parts of your rails application
8596067 note number to phone hasnt been localized yet and probably never will be at least not in core look out for new internationalization localization plugins like a new version of globalize as they will probably support stuff like that
8596068 another note number to currency number to percentage and number to human size all use number with precision internally and number with precision uses number with delimiter internally
8596069 you need to be on edge rails in order to use the rails i18n features
8596070 for date and time formats you also need to install the localized dates link
8596071 the best place to put your locale configuration in my opinion is config locales the localized dates plugin will copy two locales en us and de at in this directory you can extend or modify them and also create new locales
8596072 heres the demo locale that was used for this demo application
8596073 you also need to set up the default locale and or locale in your environment rb or an initializer
8596074 you may have noticed that inside the number part of the locale we defined format and currency in general locales are structured hierarchically i e a currencies are numbers percentages are numbers etc currency can either override the basic format settings in our case we set precision to 2 instead of 3 or extend them we add two new options unit and format
8596075 the same holds true for dates and times if needed datetime and time with zone can be used to specifically address formatting of their respective types instead of just relying on the settings for time note however that usually you want to use the same formats as time
8596076 having regard to the overriding need to maintain law and order and to guarantee security of law abiding residents of the state the government hereby urges every citizen to disregard the order and go about their lawful duties
8596077 the state government will not hesitate to permanently close down and seal up any firm market or business organisation that obeys or complies with the massob order or any other order by massob henceforth
8596078 for example the police officer who shoots the muslim man isnt portrayed as a cut and dried racist i thought it was quite a clever twist that the police commissioner who is put in charge with investigating the shooting is a muslim himself
8596079 imagine how much more fun you couldve had last night with girls and that new bronzerider even told us all to eat what a broody dragon that one is especially with his redheaded little boytoy
8596080 still most of the greenriders in the bunch were good
8596081 kunst is in de eerste plaats een vorm van communicatie die beroep doet op de bereidheid van de toeschouwer om tot een geestelijke dialoog te komen met de betrokken kunstenaar
8596082 we gaven onze zaak de naam carroesel omdat in de woning van de kunstenaar een paardje in papier mach stond dat vroeger op een echte kindermolen was gemonteerd we mochten dat van zoon kenneth smith behouden
8596083 i consider this as a very defining moment in our history
8596084 and this is in pursuance of the clamor and demand for change that you have seen during the elections
8596085 we can still form a very strong government and it is our intention to do that
8596086 we are very aware of the mandate that has been given to us we must honor the mandate
8596087 there were no signs of trauma or foul play well be doing toxicology and other tests which will take up to six weeks
8596088 mainly to determine whether alcohol or drugs played a part in a persons death
8596089 seven variables can be combined into a convenient risk scoring system before coronary angiography is performed to predict in hospital mortality following pci
8596090 this model may be useful in providing patients with individualized evidence based estimates of procedural risk as part of the informed consent process before pci
8596091 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8596092 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8596093 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking
8596094 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
8596095 this survey reveals that there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts

8596098 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8596099 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8596100 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8596101 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8596102 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8596103 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8596104 hillary clinton has asked me to im sad that were not talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8596105 asif zardari is the enemy of judiciary enemy of justice
8596106 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8596107 i hope the member for permatang pauh will contribute to the proceedings of this house i am satisfied he has been unanimously appointed leader of the opposition
8596108 i would like to welcome the member for permatang pauh who is back in the house after a second political tsunami the government is like the titanic which is going to sink
8596109 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8596110 from the march 8 elections till now we have done nothing but politicking but the defections havent happened they are waiting for it to happen but it hasnt happened good luck to them
8596111 they the fda were concentrating on the more severe forms of the condition but we felt it was important to get this information out there
8596112 while a definite causal relationship between byetta and pancreatitis has not been proved to better understand the suspected relationship amylin and lilly continue to pursue a comprehensive drug safety program that includes extensive internal and external review of individual cases and clinical and epidemiologic studies
8596113 attention if obama becomes president i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
8596114 it will be such a slap in the face of white america that millions of americans will join their movement and bring on the race war they have been waiting for
8596115 are white people ready to accept a black man as president of the us what we would hope is that we would look at him not as a black man but as a citizen of this country
8596116 but i know this country they killed my brother they killed robert kennedy
8596117 i know what this country can do if they want to get rid of you they can do it
8596118 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8596119 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8596120 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
8596121 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
8596122 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
8596123 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces pancreatitis
8596124 you could be causing more trouble than what you started with
8596125 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
8596126 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues

8596138 how do we get students to care more about networking
8596139 you know the complaint about most professors is they dont seem to care about career stuff they teach their discipline but dont even talk about job search career management networking or any of that stuff how many professors actually network on their own
8596140 let them know that theyll probably be changing jobs every two years for their entire career
8596141 it is very good let me have a think how you could best use it and i will get back in few days

8596293 even as thousands of fans plan to bid farewell to memorial stadium they are reminded there will be an encore to tonights final act the fort wayne wizards play what is expected to be their final game in memorial stadium this evening the only home venue the team has known in its existence starting with opening day 2009 the team which will announce a new name within the next month will play its games downtown in the 30 million stadium portion of the 130 million harrison square development randy brown memorial coliseum general manager said memorial stadium will still be used next year after its main tenant leaves he said it is being kept open just in case a problem arises with the downtown ballpark so the team will have a place to play next season

8596334 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8596335 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8596336 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8596337 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8596338 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8596339 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

8596365 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8596366 foi uma grande coincid ncia recebi um cat logo da grife animale em casa e adorei a blusa resolvi ent o usar no workshop da novela ter a feira
8596367 repeti a mesma roupa de cleo pires em uma festa mas isso n o me aborrece demos boas gargalhadas
8596368 ela estava posando como l via e a pe a estava compondo a personagem
8596369 a blusa campe e ainda acompanha um cinto que d todo um charme para a mulher de personalidade forte assim como juliana e grazi
8596370 sinal de bom senso equil brio e estilo no dia a dia se voc escolher uma roupa que combina com voc use sempre mas quem est em cena tem que tomar cuidado para n o parecer um v deo velho

8596374 weve identified the folks that are very concerned about the bristol bay watershed and the clean water and the fish
8596375 we believe they are savvy people and tired of the rhetoric and the fibs on both sides and the emotion
8596376 to convince people that something evil was going to happen that jobs would be lost and that wasnt the case
8596377 it is for sure the monies being spent on that side did not get reported properly
8596378 however the disappointing results we have seen over the past few weeks at the beginning of our most critical quarter indicate we will fall substantially short of our expectations for 2008
8596379 our focus for the remainder of 2008 is to implement our plans to refocus cott on its private label business we believe this remains the best path to improved profitability
8596380 firstly they may look to maintain their preferred branded choices but are not afraid to shop around to get the best deals
8596381 at the next stage private label has become a serious contender as consumers no longer see own brand premium ranges as inferior
8596382 so many non american players trained at bollettieris as kids the maria sharapovas and people like that it would be bizarre not to expect them to be speaking english
8596383 maybe because i speak so many languages and im so international i have an advantage
8596384 im not sure but i always thought the fans were really good to me everywhere excited to see me
8596385 i know i need to speak with everyone familiar english but maybe we also need a translator sometimes i dont understand some questions
8596386 you feel more comfortable when you travel outside of your own country which is pretty much all the time on tour
8596387 i dont have a problem putting my pads on and standing and cheering
8596388 the most important thing to me is getting us ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8596389 i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8596390 ive been that guy where i needed that fourth preseason game now im fortunate enough to start its necessary for some guys if not to make this team to make someone elses team you want to give everybody the best chance to make the team
8596391 i think every team this week is really preparing mostly for next week the season opener
8596392 you know who your opponent is you know who youre playing against its all football so youre still working on your football skills but everybodys going to throw in a little bit of their opponent for week 1 and mix some of that into practice
8596393 this week right here its kind of been leading more toward miami
8596394 we all have that competitive spirit like brett of wanting to play but coaches will make that decision and put us in as best a position as possible
8596395 before i won a grand slam the people thought of me ok as a big joker of the sport and a big potential and pretty good player but still i wasnt able to make that step forward and win a grand slam and just prove
8596396 i did this year i did prove i have enough quality to be potential grand slam winner on any surface i play so this is the most important thing to me
8596397 there is a lot of pressure involved and a lot of expectations but its all part of the sport and you just have to deal with it in the best possible way
8596398 i always want people to remember me of course as a tennis player as a great tennis player a champion whatever i dont want them to remember me as a clown
8596399 to come back to the place where i did well and had a lot of success and a lot of memories
8596400 i think the fact that i didnt play every week when i was six definitely helped out
8596401 i dont know if its such a good idea for kids to be traveling the world you get jaded and you miss out on things or you dont look forward to things that you should look forward to
8596402 im not saying itll work for everyone but it worked for me i enjoy the sport and i enjoy playing im just having a whole new love for it
8596403 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8596404 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8596405 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8596406 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8596407 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8596408 there were no signs of trauma or foul play well be doing toxicology and other tests which will take up to six weeks

8596413 flat out the discovery of this years un certain regard section
8596414 well go out there try to play well put some points on the board and were just trying to fine tune for the opener
8596415 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8596416 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8596417 some of them are playing for a spot on the team some of them are playing to expand their roles
8596418 permit me to remind everyone here who is in charge of miracles for the new york giants

8596421 if they are targeting people based on language when language is not essential to the job at hand which is playing golf then it is discrimination
8596422 we agree we should speak some english we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8596423 this has been the tours policy i just never heard anything about a penalty until today ive been reading about it on the internet its gotten a real bad spin

8596456 i must be one of the most unfortunate people in football in that respect
8596457 it is very frustrating sat on the bench week in week out watching games i am 21 now and i need to be doing something i want to play
8596458 its no secret the manager knows that and weve had a few chats in pre season about my position and a lot of things have been mentioned like transfers and loans
8596459 i want to be a boro player theres no doubt about that i think we are on the verge of big things here
8596460 it is nice to be involved in such attacking play hopefully against yeovil i showed the manager what i can do
8596461 the ban has been reduced to four days and starts on september 15
8596462 its a weight off my shoulders and i cant thank sir mark and the owners for their loyalty
8596463 if he needs a tendon or a groin operation then 10 15 days off is a little optimistic and one would look for three to six weeks off
8596464 on the other hand he is a very fit young man and he will recover quickly
8596465 his surgeon will have had many investigations and will have ascertained what needs to be done and it will be done there and then
8596466 the chc has confirmed that no penalty will be imposed on the player in accordance with rule 147 cc of the 2008 official guide
8596467 i am due to speak to peter walker and i am hopeful we can have one more player
8596468 there could be some movement but that is out of my hands it is up to other managers to make the call to myself i have got one or two messages to speak to managers and we will see how that pans out
8596469 it was a good days work and nice to complete so many laps
8596470 its the fastest circuit of the year and so we were trying out our low downforce package which went well although it always feels strange to drive with such little downforce on the car
8596471 the track was also quite green which didnt help but i was happy with the set up work we completed even though we still have a lot to learn

8596477 the pay for ellison 64 doesnt include the 544 million he made last year exercising stock option grants
8596478 its fun its in focus we know what bits are fun and which are not and its just a matter of time now
8596479 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
8596480 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
8596481 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
8596482 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
8596483 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
8596484 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
8596485 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
8596486 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
8596487 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
8596488 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
8596489 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
8596490 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
8596491 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
8596492 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
8596493 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
8596494 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
8596495 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
8596496 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered
8596497 actually this possible negative effect of opioids such as morphine to cause increased sensitivity to pain was observed in the 19th century
8596498 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
8596499 we looked at it through our nmr machine and were amazed by what we saw fluid simulating patients bodies rushed calcium out of the bioglass and then into the new bones it seems perhaps a glass of milk a day really is what the doctor ordered
8596500 frankly i have the feeling that the customers will hardly notice

8596502 it was extremely aggressive behaviour from the two eagles it was something we had not seen before
8596503 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

8596507 this pattern of associations with earlier age of nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis being linked more strongly to the risk of developing subsequent malignancies is consistent with the pattern that one would expect for a marker of inherited predisposition to cancer
8596508 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
8596509 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8596510 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8596511 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8596512 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8596513 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems

8596523 we were surprised to find such a pronounced reduction in basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma incidence in users of ace inhibitors or arbs in such a high risk group over a short amount of time

8596525 the prevalence of adhd is concerning to the medical community adhd may affect adults in their professional life social life and relationships

8596544 i had crossed this field when i thought i heard this singing it started out low and got louder the more i walked like a beacon of sorts well i went ahead and followed this singing wherever it was coming from
8596545 and there it was this small church in the middle of the desert it was sunday morning the singing that i heard was the choir it was the most beautiful singing ive ever heard
8596546 i walked inside stretched out on one of the pews in the back and fell asleep
8596547 after the service i met the preacher and his wife and told them that i had gone out to west to look for work said my father
8596548 they invited me into their home gave me something to eat and a bed to sleep in that night i was so tired i slept until the next day
8596549 and dad wired me the bus fare i was on the next bus home
8596550 they hit me a couple of times and then someone hit me on the back of my leg with a metal bar that put me straight down they then started kicking me i managed to hobble home with the help of my friend but then i had to go to the hospital i wont walk through the park again

8596557 the concern is that if it is headed for the gulf it could impact oil producers in that area
8596558 we have sort of seen oil prices steady until the last couple of days that could mean we are pretty close to the end of the decline
8596559 its a strategy to create a better life for all of us
8596560 together we can accomplish more than any single group on its own
8596561 it looks like a category 3 keep in mind when we talk about the uncertainty of exactly where its headed where its going to make landfall they did a study over the last 10 years on the intensity forecast of these storms for a category 3 for example they found that sometimes it can be as strong they can have the intensity off and it can be a category 5 it can be two categories stronger or two categories weaker so were looking at either a category 3 possibly a 5 or even a category 1 when it makes landfall
8596562 sunday it looks like its going to move into the gulf of mexico as a category 2 or a category 3 storm
8596563 this entire coastline is where we could see a direct hit obviously that includes southeast texas so we have to be mindful and we have to watch this carefully over the next several days
8596564 lets all be watching and praying for a tropical storm but preparing for a category 4 storm
8596565 you have thus willfully violated the free history projects intellectual property rights
8596566 essentially the database means we will have a list of all cctv camera locations available at our fingertips
8596567 this means if a crime occurs in the immediate vicinity of a business that we know has cctv cameras installed we can contact the business owners and access the footage immediately
8596568 previously we have not had this information and had to spend crucial amounts of time contacting businesses so the database may play a vital role in our investigations

8596681 every year madagascar imports about 200 000 tonnes of rice for consumption this year the gap is estimated at 270 000 tonnes and that will present a challenge
8596682 importing rice at international prices means paying 70 percent more than current local prices and that isnt expected to change
8596683 madagascar stands to benefit as a major exporter to the indian ocean islands of comoros seychelles and mauritius for example countries in eastern and southern africa could be another major export market
8596684 malnourishment in madagascar is aggravated by peoples dependence on just one food rice which provides calories but not many nutrients or protein
8596685 this is the first significant sorghum harvest the south has had in nearly 20 years

8596687 actually ive fallen several times like four times already but this one time i fell it was the only one that made perez hilton and youtube i didnt think anything of it when it happened i just laughed it off onstage but the next day i see that it hit the internet and i was like nooooooo it totally stung because i wasnt expecting it but i didnt get hurt and joe jonas helped me out a lot with that he made a ton of jokes about it
8596688 i did a duet with the jonas brothers on my album and we wrote the song together
8596689 its like a breakup song and its called on the line it was important to have them on my album because i mean just look at how successful they are i would love to have their input anytime because theyre obviously doing something right
8596690 i tend to write songs that are i guess a little bit more intense and less catchy and i needed help writing catchy songs
8596691 so thats where they came in i put a lot of my musical input and lyrics into these songs and they just helped me with hooks and stuff like that
8596692 theres a song i wrote myself that i hope fans will react to and connect with
8596693 the song is about feeling insecure and just not feeling pretty and i hope girls my age can relate to it because i just felt like there needed to be a song about how not everyone has confidence i know it sounds cheesy but its true
8596694 i used to write really dark songs every night in my room like five or six a night and id be up until 5 in the morning and my mom would come up and say so what are you writing
8596695 id play her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it really is therapy for me so i put everything in my lyrics you wont necessarily find a lot of that on the album but hopefully you will on the next album its my first one so i wanted it to be fun stuff you can drive around in your car to and jam out to
8596696 shes done collaborations with reba mcintire who was her idol growing up and kelly clarkson has been my idol growing up hopefully one day i could collaborate with her that would be the biggest dream come true
8596697 youll be hanging swanging drinking two types of patr n

8596700 the record it got leaked then me and kirk franklin had to talk he was doing most of the talking he was saying it wasnt no disrespect he was saying he knows how songs get leaked he had it happen to him before he said he wasnt a saint and it wasnt like he never did nothing wrong its not like kirk said i did something wrong he said if i was gonna go with it just change the melody you can still say silver and gold hes got a lot of people saying stuff to him how could you let t pain destroy a gospel song like that how could let him talk about alcohol i wasnt even doing it for a mixtape or nothing i was literally drinking and made a song i was bored in the studio there was nothing else to do i made it into an alcoholic anthem which wasnt good
8596701 everybody thought it was the first single somebody was putting it out as the first single off of new album pain or pleasure somebody was just making up an album name just so they can put it out thats why my album isnt coming out on my birthday no more because i had to push it back we had to stop that song
8596702 that pushed the single back then we had to push the album back
8596703 cant believe it was getting overtaken by silver and gold it was just a lot
8596704 i just came up with it man i kinda stole some stuff from the last itunes commercial i got the same people to direct it i was like if we can find those people to direct my next video it will be the best video i already knew just the way i see things
8596705 nothing has to be organized we was like we gonna do it and then see what we got outta that it just all came together it took eight hours a bunch of takes six outfits and the song aint even four minutes the song is basically a perspective of not settling for what you doing you can be doing better even if you think youre at the peak of your career youre at the top its something else you can be doing dont settle into what you been pretty much forced into doing
8596706 well to the average adult all their music may just seem like bubblegum but when you really look at it theyve clearly grown

8596708 they also seem to have an instinctive ability to market themselves each of them has their own look that is pretty well defined
8596709 theyre going to have long term success because all three of them are vital to the bands popularity
8596710 its a first year for a lot of things for us so we just want to thank the fans
8596711 were excited its a song that weve been performing all summer long so itll be a little different because were doing it at an awards show in front of all the celebrities that you grew up watching but at the same time its just kind of like us doing our thing
8596712 i definitely think the jonas brothers are capable of breaking out of their teen pop bubble
8596713 theyre a very marketable group and their reach extends not only to teenybopper girls but they still have fans who are guys and theyve managed to keep their relevance because of all these other projects they are emerging as a franchise
8596714 the vmas are going to increase their visibility with the music community and those who perceive them as the male equivalent of a
8596715 i want to do it but can i write about avery i hope it will be okay

8596834 mcneese is a very explosive fast football team typically their program is marked by having very very fast skilled players guys can actually run really well in that program theyre going to run a spread offense and weve talked about it before that when youre playing a spread offensive team you really need to be disciplined its going to be discipline execution and not giving up big plays
8596835 if you watch spread offenses very seldom do they go 16 plays for 80 yards there are always big plays in there big plays with the reverse big plays with the quarterback running the ball big plays in the play action they try to get you sucked in trying to stop the dive and the read option part of it and then all of a sudden youll see whether its west virginia or any of the other teams that have probably been very good at it there are big plays you have to match them speed wise you dont want to go out there with guys trying to cover theyve got 4 4 4 5 wide receivers and youve got 4 6 4 7 secondary guys thats not a real good matchup
8596836 we talk to the defense all the time about youve got to run chase and swarm the football we want to try to get 11 guys around the ball as often as possible the only way that you can play with reckless abandon is youve got to be really confident in knowing your assignments
8596837 i think back to last year how many times that we and out of necessity because of injuries but the number of times that mark paschal had to play in some situations it really hurt their growth and development to just get focused and locked in and zeroed in on one particular position so hopefully we start out with a little bit better basis at the beginning of this season hopefully if theyll all stay healthy then i think that will allow them to continue to grow and play better
8596838 until a lot of these guys get battle tested in covering kicks which was a big sore spot with us last year we didnt at times do as well as certainly you need to to win ball games covering punts and covering kickoffs its an area that we need to get better we hope that were starting off with a better pool of players that are more experienced they understand the schemes that theyre going to see hopefully well have a little bit faster of a unit of guys that are out there covering the kicks
8596839 the accuracy for both of them is definitely good i think jay wooten has got a little more strength just because hes been here for a year lifting and stuff like that hes gotten to develop a little more than casey barth has straight out of high school
8596840 so i definitely think jay has got a little more leg strength and thats shown on his kickoffs putting it on the goal line and a couple of yards deep so definitely jay with the leg strength but they both can be deadly accurate
8596841 i just feel comfortable now knowing that i can tell when blitzes are coming instead of just waiting for them to come i actually can see things happening before they actually happen and thats another plus you can play a lot faster that way it feels like high school again i feel like that i can dominate this game now that i know what to do and where to be
8596842 ive been out here so long im worried about getting fired for taking so much time

8596888 shame on yourself microsoft for paying jerry seinfeld 10 million when people in north america are hit by recession and foreclosures and barely surviving we urge everybody not to buy microsofts products

8596912 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought

8596914 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
8596915 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
8596916 the democrats are trying very hard to show that theyre not going to re open these issues and that the bush crimes will remain buried for all time
8596917 it would start a new administration on the same level that george bush left it and thats a very sad thing
8596918 weve had eight years of moral relativism and the avoidance of legal process
8596919 and to start a major campaign with the suggestion that were going to distinguish between egregious and non egregious crimes promises more of the same
8596920 did we just see accountability go out the window for good
8596921 there are very few obligations that a president has to do under the constitution but one of them is not to violate the laws that he is supposed to enforce
8596922 and what really concerns me about cass sunsteins statement is that i dont know what a non egregious crime by a president or by an administration might be i think that all crimes committed by the government particularly the president are egregious
8596923 i dont understand why some democrats cant just simply accept a very straightforward proposition that well prosecute any crimes committed by this administration an obama administration a mccain administration because theyre crimes theyre all egregious
8596924 several members of the conservative legal community in washington said in interviews that they hoped mr bush would issue such pre emptive pardons they said people who carried out the presidents orders should not be exposed even to the risk of an investigation and expensive legal bills
8596925 i think this would be the ultimate and final show of contempt by this president for the rule of law
8596926 i think this president would find it very consistent to say i can tell prople to commit crimes and then i can pardon them for it what is very troubling is that there appear to be democrats on the other side who would welcome that
8596927 the study tracks rents and home prices back to 1960 and found annual rents fluctuated at around 5 to 5 25 of home prices until 1995
8596928 it clearly shows that its warm and is made up of cells otherwise our cameras wouldnt indicate red so it can be a sea snake or some other kind of sea animal
8596929 yet the temple at ephesus and that in samos are surely remarkable the pyramids too were greater than words can tell and each of them is the equivalent of many of the great works of the greeks but the labyrinth surpasses the pyramids also
8596930 it has twelve covered courts six in a row facing north six south the gates of the one range exactly fronting the gates of the other inside the building is of two storeys and contains three thousand rooms of which half are underground and the other half directly above them i was taken through the rooms in the upper storey so what i shall say of them is from my own observation but the underground ones i can speak of only from report because the egyptians in charge refused to let me see them as they contain the tombs of the kings who built the labyrinth and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles the upper rooms on the contrary i did actually see and it is hard to believe that they are the work of men the baffling and intricate passages from room to room and from court to court were an endless wonder to me as we passed from a courtyard into rooms from rooms into galleries from galleries into more rooms and thence into yet more courtyards the roof of every chamber courtyard and gallery is like the walls of stone the walls are covered with carved figures and each court is exquisitely built of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade
8596931 the circuit of this lake is a distance of about 420 miles which is equal to the whole seaboard of egypt the length of the lake is north and south and its depth at the deepest is 50 fathoms 300 feet that it is handmade and dug it itself is the best evidence for in about the middle of the lake stand two pyramids that top the water each one by 50 fathoms 300 feet and each built as much again underwater and on top of each there is a huge stone figure of a man sitting on a throne so these pyramids are 100 fathoms 600 feet high and these 100 fathoms are the equivalent of a 600 foot furlong the fathom measuring 6 feet or four cubits the cubit being six spans the water in the lake is not fed with natural springs for the country here is terribly waterless but it enters the lake from the nile by a channel and for six months it flows into the lake and then another six it flows again into the nile during the six months that it flows out it brings into the royal treasury each day a silver talent for the fish from it and when the water flows in it brings 20 minas a day
8596932 at the corner where the labyrinth ends there is nearby a pyramid 240 feet high and engraved with great animals the road to this is made underground
8596933 near the first entrance to the canal and on proceeding thence about 30 or 40 stadia 3 5 4 5 miles one comes to a flat trapezium shaped place which has a village and also a great palace composed of many palaces as many in number as there were nomes in earlier times for this is the number of courts surrounded by colonnades continuous with one another all in a single row and along one wall the structure being as it were a long wall with the courts in front of it and the roads leading into them are exactly opposite the wall
8596934 in front of the entrances are crypts as it were which are long and numerous and have winding passages communicating with one another so that no stranger can find his way either into any court or out of it without a guide but the marvellous thing is that the roof of each of the chambers consists of a single stone and that the breadths of the crypts are likewise roofed with single slabs of surpassing size with no intermixture anywhere of timber or of any other material
8596935 and on ascending to the roof which is at no great height inasmuch as the labyrinth has only one story one can see a plain of stone consisting of stones of that great size and thence descending out into the courts again one can see that they lie in a row and are each supported by 27 monolithic pillars and their walls also are composed of stones that are no smaller in size at the end of this building which occupies more than a stadium is the tomb a quadrangular pyramid which has sides about 4 plethra 404 feet in width and a height equal thereto
8596936 sailing along shore for a distance of one hundred stadia 11
8596937 and the masses betaking themselves to tumults and the killing of one another the twelve most important leaders formed a solemn league among themselves and after they had met together for counsel in memphis and had drawn up agreements setting forth their mutual goodwill and loyalty they proclaimed themselves kings after they had reigned in accordance with their oaths and promises and had maintained their mutual concord for a period of fifteen years they set about to construct a common tomb for themselves
8596938 being full of zeal for this undertaking they eagerly strove to surpass all preceding rulers in the magnitude of their structure for selecting a site at the entrance to lake moeris in libya they constructed their tomb of the finest stone and they made it in form a square but in magnitude a stade in length 607 feet on each side and in the carvings and indeed in all the workmanship they left nothing wherein succeeding rulers could excel them
8596939 quite the most abnormal achievement on which man has spent his resources but by no means a fictitious one as might well be supposed
8596940 the first labyrinth ever to be constructed was built according to tradition 3 600 years ago by king petesuchis or king tithoes although herodotus attributes the whole work to the twelve kings the last of whom was psammetichus
8596941 various reasons are suggested for its construction demoteles supposes it to have been the palace of moteris and lyceas the tomb of moeris while many writers state that it was erected as a temple to the sun god and this is the general belief whatever the truth may be there is no doubt that daedalus adopted it as the model for the labyrinth built by him in crete but that he reproduced only a hundredth part of it containing passages that wind advance and retreat in a bewilderingly intricate manner
8596942 the few repairs that had been made were carried out by one man alone chaeremon the eunuch of king necthebis nectanebo ii 360 343 bc
8596943 on the south of the pyramid lay a wide mass of chips and fragments of building which had long generally been identified with the celebrated labyrinth doubts however existed mainly owing to lepsius having considered the brick buildings on the site to have been part of the labyrinth when i began to excavate the result was soon plain that the brick chambers were built on the top of the ruins of a great stone structure and hence they were only the houses of a village as they had at first appeared to me to be but beneath them and far away over a vast area the layers of stone chips were found and so great was the mass that it was difficult to persuade visitors that the stratum was artificial and not a natural formation
8596944 beneath all these fragments was a uniform smooth bed of cement or plaster on which the pavement of the building had been laid while on the south side where the canal had cut across the site it could be seen how the chip stratum about six feet thick suddenly ceased at what had been the limits of the building no trace of architectural arrangement could be found to help in identifying this great structure with the labyrinth but the mere extent of it proved that it was far larger than any temple known in egypt all the temples of karnak of luxor and a few on the western side of thebes might be placed together within the vast space of these buildings at hawara
8596945 we know from pliny and others how for centuries the labyrinth had been a great quarry for the whole district and its destruction occupied such a body of masons that a small town existed there all this information and the recorded position of it agrees so closely with what we can trace that no doubt can now remain regarding the position of one of the wonders of egypt
8596946 no one has received any trauma related counseling or orientation on hygiene and sanitation issues
8596947 many said the prime minister should have given priority to the epic struggle for survival instead of visiting china for the closing ceremony of the olympics
8596948 the government should find their missing loved ones and provide food proper shelter clothes medication and a long term solution as their houses and land have been destroyed by the flood
8596949 the indian technical team mobilized required resources and has remained in readiness to carry out the required work to strengthen the embankment
8596950 but it was prevented from reaching the site as a consequence thousands of people in nepal and india have been forced to suffer a calamity that could have been avoided
8596951 the successful april elections signal that the people of nepal are entering a hopeful phase for peace and prosperity
8596952 however the promise of peace has not come to fruition for these children whose lives have been adversely affected by the conflict today they are still in the maoist cantonments they must be released immediately unmin un mission in nepal child protection advisers unicef and its partners should have access to these children to make sure that they receive their rights to recovery and reintegration
8596953 as the largest party the maoists were to hold the first position in the coalition cabinet with nine ministers including prime minister
8596954 as the second largest party in the alliance the uml was to have six ministries including deputy pm
8596955 however the maoists insisted on the first slot as well as the second relegating the uml to the third spot that is unacceptable to us
8596956 since the maoists did not get simple majority in the election they have to forge a consensus with the uml and the mjf if they can do that there will be stability in nepal and the main task the drafting of a new constitution in two years will be accomplished
8596957 however if they fail to do so the focus will be diffused and the main agenda of the parties will be reduced to a game of forming and dissolving governments
8596958 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8596959 in other words imagine that in addition to this year another four years will be under your management work with this in mind act and plan accordingly
8596960 even if ayatollah khamenei would want deep down in his heart ahmadinejad to be the winner of irans future presidential elections he wouldnt express his wish so clearly and publicly
8596961 government officials officials in charge of irans official news agency were probably so happy about khameneis comments that they didnt realize the way they published his comments was not in the interests of the islamic republic
8596962 the remarks by irans supreme leader are a sign of his unconditional support for ahmadinejads government a government that came to power with his special backing
8596963 the problem ahmadinejads government is facing and to a certain degree khamenei is that gradually significant numbers of hard liners have turned into ahamdinejads critics because of his economic policies and his performance on the international scene which has put iran under the shadow of sanctions isolation and even military attack
8596964 the problems that exist in iran cannot be ignored by those living there
8596965 if we interpret ayatollah khameneis comments as a done deal meaning that ahmadinejad will be irans next president whether we like it or not then this is tantamount to the end of the republic system of the establishment
8596966 but i dont think this is the case even if the leader supports such view in the end i think its up to the citizens to decide whether they want ahmadinejad to be president for a second time or not
8596967 its nothing unusual not just one term or two terms ahamdinejad can remain in power for as many terms as khamenei would want him anyhow i hope the people of iran will have a say
8596968 i think michelle obama kicked it off pretty well dont you think
8596969 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8596970 what its like when youve got a president who actually puts people first thank you president clinton
8596971 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8596972 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8596973 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8596974 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8596975 the concern is that if it is headed for the gulf it could impact oil producers in that area
8596976 we have sort of seen oil prices steady until the last couple of days that could mean we are pretty close to the end of the decline
8596977 its a strategy to create a better life for all of us
8596978 together we can accomplish more than any single group on its own
8596979 this is an effort to reclaim for our communities the power that the arts have for transformation
8596980 you have a place to go home to i dont michael cooper didnt either
8596981 in my understanding of faith every human being has the right to food shelter clothing and medical care and we have to find a way in our community and nation to remedy that
8596982 you have to be conscious of the fact that the folks we deal with arent peoples most favorite folks
8596983 you know its the panhandlers and stuff and during economic crunch time people will say why spend money on those things
8596984 what our new residents are looking for is not just pretty buildings and condominiums but also social responsibility
8596985 because at the end of the day what we do for the least among us reflects on how we all will be treated
8596986 and that is a powerful exercise for a growing city
8596987 he had problems but he died in the street and he could have been someones father son uncle you name it who is he leaving behind

8597001 the record it got leaked then me and kirk franklin had to talk he was doing most of the talking he was saying it wasnt no disrespect he was saying he knows how songs get leaked he had it happen to him before he said he wasnt a saint and it wasnt like he never did nothing wrong its not like kirk said i did something wrong he said if i was gonna go with it just change the melody you can still say silver and gold hes got a lot of people saying stuff to him how could you let t pain destroy a gospel song like that how could let him talk about alcohol i wasnt even doing it for a mixtape or nothing i was literally drinking and made a song i was bored in the studio there was nothing else to do i made it into an alcoholic anthem which wasnt good
8597002 everybody thought it was the first single somebody was putting it out as the first single off of new album pain or pleasure somebody was just making up an album name just so they can put it out thats why my album isnt coming out on my birthday no more because i had to push it back we had to stop that song
8597003 that pushed the single back then we had to push the album back
8597004 cant believe it was getting overtaken by silver and gold it was just a lot
8597005 i just came up with it man i kinda stole some stuff from the last itunes commercial i got the same people to direct it i was like if we can find those people to direct my next video it will be the best video i already knew just the way i see things
8597006 nothing has to be organized we was like we gonna do it and then see what we got outta that it just all came together it took eight hours a bunch of takes six outfits and the song aint even four minutes the song is basically a perspective of not settling for what you doing you can be doing better even if you think youre at the peak of your career youre at the top its something else you can be doing dont settle into what you been pretty much forced into doing
8597007 moving from our prior homegrown paper based succession process to successfactors has given us a better method to identify and assess our talent
8597008 using successfactors we are now able to look at talent management through an entirely new lens that gives us the insight to create new ways to retain our top talent and incorporate this into our larger business strategy
8597009 caribou coffee is a great example of a company driving the strategy of its business by aligning employee development with business goals
8597010 successfactors helps to ensure that their population of employees is the best they can be which in turn will help drive more sales better service and more engaged employees

8597129 the eyes of the world are on the chevy volt
8597130 there doesnt seem to be any obvious breakthrough in battery technology
8597131 they may be holding these results close to the vest
8597132 of course its realistic is it what gm is going to do not so sure
8597133 why did the ev 1 not use any gas but an electric car years later needs gas and gets less than half the range
8597134 the volt is not only a pr move but a fine balancing act of maintaining the political status quo with oil industries and pleasing the demand for green energy
8597135 the ev 1 could only go as far as the charge would take it 100 miles
8597136 the beauty of a hybrid is that for the 80 percent of americans that only drive 40 miles a day the volt would be fine
8597137 you have to be able to develop something that works then you have to be able to mass produce it

8597139 theres so much money put into r and d in the first place they want to get it out there to get some good press
8597140 the thing that gms not pointing out is how much power
8597141 these are the same arguments we heard with the ev 1
8597142 the same cannibalistic smears but this time to a smaller degree
8597143 history has a tendency to repeat itself thats why im cautious about the volt
8597144 when you introduce a radically different product you have to do it at the ideal time
8597145 now that gas prices are high people are going to look for alternatives
8597146 im disappointed by the way we played we had our opportunities but our day cricket has not been consistent especially with the bat we have not been consistent
8597147 if you are not capable of getting the runs it is quite difficult to win matches
8597148 we just need to make sure that our batting is consistent in one day cricket it is important that you be very consistent with the bat that is where i think we lost the series

8597311 the key is that you put your arm around the person in the picture to be sure you get in it
8597312 the reason this is important is because research showed older people who tend to have longer stays in hospital were getting malnourished in hospital
8597313 the reason for protected mealtimes was to focus on helping people eat and the red tray system was a way of indicating without making a fuss that that person needed help with their meals
8597314 were really pleased ipswich hospital introduced protected mealtimes it would be good if they could use the red tray system too
8597315 we have protected mealtimes and food in the hospital is very important to both patients and people who work within it because is it a big part of peoples road to recovery
8597316 we havent got a red tray system but we have similar systems
8597317 we are also very grateful to people who say they or their relatives have problems eating and speak up for help
8597318 we had rehearsals in the morning and then on the show they showed some pictures of me and they asked about my drama at university

8597334 no not at all its keloid change of plan i wont remove the smaller mole from your breast in case that does the same the scar may be larger than the mole
8597335 yes of course when a wound heals it leaves a scar a keloid is a special type of scar one that grows too much and can become larger than the wound itself spreading outside the original area of skin damage
8597336 well its always tender and sometimes throbs a bit but i thought that was because i had major surgery and that it would improve over time what should it be like
8597337 well it shouldnt give you any discomfort and should just be a pale flat pencil line yours is more like a knotted rope does it itch
8597338 what makes it happen is it something ive done or havent done or something to do with the procedure i had
8597339 no not at all the reasons keloids occur arent fully understood most people never suffer from them others get them after the most minor of injuries even an acne spot or chickenpox scar keloids affect dark skinned people much more easily than those with a paler skin theyre especially common in people with black skin they can crop up anywhere but are most likely to do so on the upper chest and shoulders and also on the earlobes
8597340 well theyre most common between the ages of 10 and 30 years but if youve had one before or if members of your family have had them then youre at extra risk of getting one hence my decision not to remove the smaller mole
8597341 are they dangerous in any way i mean can they change and become cancerous for example
8597342 ill write you a prescription for some silicone gel apply a small amount daily im confident it will help the scar flatten soften and become paler it should also relieve any discomfort or itching
8597343 if not are there any other ways of treating it
8597344 you could have a further operation but that would be likely to lead to an even bigger keloid forming its possible to have steroid injections into the scar but theyre not always successful early ones can be treated with pressure dressings or freezing with liquid nitrogen but im optimistic that youll find the silicone gel successful
8597345 i went online after i got back and booked us a fortnight in crete
8597346 you could have a further operation but that would be likely to lead to an even bigger keloid forming
8597347 putting a silicone sheet over them at night for several months helps some keloids to flatten long term compression with pressure bandages sometimes helps too
8597348 it is like buses you wait 20 years for a left winger and then two turn up at once
8597349 i must be one of the most unfortunate people in football in that respect
8597350 it is very frustrating sat on the bench week in week out watching games i am 21 now and i need to be doing something i want to play

8597554 those of us who supported this fiscal package reasoned that the program would boost consumer confidence as well as available cash the evidence is now in and that optimism was unwarranted recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity

8597562 with every night rhyder builds on his reputation as a songwriter on the rise expectations run high in the wake of such texas hits as conviction and freeze frame time and this album promises more starting with the first single this aint it a dramatic and passionate song about a guy trying to patch up a relationship
8597563 blessed with a soaring vocal that has an operatic timbre to it austin texas brandon rhyder has come a long way in just a short amount of time have i waited too long starts off the record and immediately showcases that vocal along with the other thing that sets rhyder apart the lyric writing the song is a self written slow building piece of ear candy that only sounds better with each successive listen in fact thats a general feeling i get about the whole album
8597564 this album is pure country infused with what listeners have come to expect from brandon rhyder this collection of songs conveys a fresh sound and perhaps a new direction for the songwriter this album weaves its way through regret friends family infidelity longing leaving staying and happiness and what a journey it is i wouldnt be surprised if one day we turn on the radio to more than one of these tracks and maybe even sung by one of todays top country artists

8597711 despite its many shortcomings mario super sluggers is good enough to offer some solid entertainment to the right gamers collect em all mariophiles will dig the new challenge mode and wii party hosts will enjoy playing frantic multiplayer games more serious baseballers will find satisfaction in facing off against one another but will find the rest of the package wanting
8597712 we wouldnt go as far as to say this is nintendo made shovelware but theres very little that has changed in the three years between mario superstar baseball on gcn and mario super sluggers on wii youve got a few new characters in the mix a few new mini games mii support for on field play and an interesting ir based item shooting system
8597713 away from the madness of the team selection its as solid a game as youd expect from any sports title with marios name attached theres a challenge mode where youre forced to pick from certain characters which is also how you unlock some of the hidden horrors on the roster and a decent variety of playing fields that come with their own unique hazards and occasionally bizarre obstructions
8597714 between the creative fields chemistry boosts and supermoves any given contest has a lot going on delivering a hectic but entertaining experience as a result balance isnt the games strongest suit and besides some significant stat differences some characters have supermoves that essentially guarantee hits like daisys field of sleep inducing flowers while others can be handled easily enough like bowsers fireball line drives but the a i proves far more criminal when it comes to baserunning

8597733 when i was four my mum went out for the night and left me with a gay male friend who sexually abused me now im older i feel that could be one of the reasons she felt she was not capable of looking after me
8597734 im hopefully going to win the x factor to prove to my real family that im not a waste of space and to prove myself to my foster parent and make her proud of me
8597735 i know it sounds a bit corny but i just want a real family just to know my real mum and my real dad and for them just to say we love you no matter what

8597740 if he needs a tendon or a groin operation then 10 15 days off is a little optimistic and one would look for three to six weeks off

8597747 i must be one of the most unfortunate people in football in that respect

8597749 its no secret the manager knows that and weve had a few chats in pre season about my position and a lot of things have been mentioned like transfers and loans
8597750 i want to be a boro player theres no doubt about that i think we are on the verge of big things here
8597751 it is nice to be involved in such attacking play hopefully against yeovil i showed the manager what i can do
8597752 i am due to speak to peter walker and i am hopeful we can have one more player

8597771 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8597772 now sen obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the old fashioned american dream his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8597773 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8597774 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8597775 and heres what i have to say about that everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8597783 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart

8597802 we knew there was a plane crash because it was on the news
8597803 he touched down on the runway and immediately knew he had a problem that the gear hadnt come out
8597804 there was minimal damage to the plane and when i say minimal it was still intact
8597805 this was a big airplane and a pretty heavy airplane
8597806 that helped the situation quite frankly i dont think the pilot was in any immediate danger

8597816 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal bulan syawal jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
8597817 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya dan janganlah kalian berpuasa sampai melihatnya hilal syawal jika ia hilal terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan tiga puluh hari kemudian berbukalah iedul fithri dan satu bulan itu 29 hari
8597818 apabila datang bulan ramadhan amka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
8597819 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyah hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
8597820 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
8597821 kuraib mengabarkan bahwa ummu fadll bintul harits mengutusnya kepada muawiyyah di syam
8597822 aku sampai di syam kemudian aku memenuhi keperluannya dan diumumkan tentang hilal ramadhan sedangkan aku masih berada di syam
8597823 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang hal ini atas beberapa pendapat
8597824 keharusan ruyah bagi setiap negeri yang tidak samar atas mereka hilal
8597825 tidak harus sama jika berbeda dua arah yakni tinggi dan rendah yang menyebabkan salah satunya mudah melihat hilal dan yang lain sulit atau bagi setiap negeri mempunyai iklim hal ini diceritakan oleh al mahdi dalam al bahr dari imam yahya dan hadawiyah
8597826 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyah tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan syam iraq dengan khurasan kedua duanya lemah dhaif karena jarak qashar shalat tidak berkaitan dengan hilal apabila seseorang menyaksikan pada malam ke 30 bulan syaban di suatu tempat dekat maupun jauh maka wajib puasa demikian juga kalau menyaksikan hilal pada waktu siang menjelang maghrib maka harus imsak berpuasa untuk waktu yang tersisa sama saja baik satu iklim atau banyak iklim
8597827 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
8597828 saya demi allah tidak mengetahui apa yang menghalangi sayyid sabiq sehingga dia memilih pendapat yang syadz ganjil ini dan enggan mengambil keumuman hadits yang shahih dan merupakan pendapat jumhur ulama sebagaimana yang dia sebutkan sendiri
8597829 puasa kalian adalah hari kalian berpuasa dan berbuka kalian iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka tidak berpuasa dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian berkurban
8597830 sanadnya jayyid dan rawi rawinya semuanya tsiqah lihat silsilah al hadits as shahihah 1 440
8597831 sebagian ahlu ilmi ulama mentafsirkan hadits ini bahwa puasa dan iedul fithri bersama mayoritas manusia
8597832 dalam hadits itu terdapat dalil bahwa hari ied ditetapkan bersama manusia orang yang mengetahui hari ied dengan ruyah sendirian wajib baginya untuk mencocoki lainnya dan mengharuskan dia untuk mengikuti mereka didalam shalat iedul fithri dan iedul adha
8597833 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu terdapat bantahan terhadap orang yang mengatakan bahwa barangsiapa mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan perkiraan hisab boleh baginya untuk berpuasa dan berbuka berbeda dengan orang yang tidak tahu juga dikatakan makna yang terkandung dalam hadits itu bahwa saksi satu orang apabila melihat hilal sedangkan hakim tidak menerima persaksiannya maka dia tidak boleh berpuasa sebagaimana manusia tidak berpuasa
8597834 yang jelas maknanya adalah bahwa perkara perkara ini bukan untuk perorangan tidak boleh bersendirian dalam hal itu perkaranya tetap diserahkan kepada imam dan jamaah atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal sedangkan imam menolak persaksiannya maka seharusnya tidak diakui dan wajib atasnya untuk mengikuti jamaah pada yang demikian itu
8597835 nahr adalah hari manusia menyembelih kurban dan iedul fithri adalah hari manusia berbuka
8597836 apa yang sudah menjadi ketetapan sebuah hukum tidak berbeda keadaannya pada orang yang diikuti dalam ruyah hilal sama saja dia seorang mujtahid yang benar atau salah atau melampaui batas tentang masalah apabila hilal tidak tampak dan tidak diumumkan padahal manusia sangat bersemangat mencarinya telah tersebut dalam as shahihah bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tentang para imam mereka para imam shalat bersama kalian jika mereka benar maka pahala bagi kalian dan mereka dan jika salah maka pahala bagi kalian dan dosa atas mereka
8597837 pendapat yang masyhur dalam madzhab imam ahmad adalah wajib puasa pada waktu itu
8597838 apabila kalian melihat hilal ramadhan maka puasalah dan apabila melihatnya hilal syawal maka berbukalah jika mendung atas kalian maka kira kirakanlah
8597839 barang siapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia sungguh telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
8597840 tidak berpuasa pada saat itu adalah madzhab imam ahmad imam ahmad juga mengatakan bahwa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan adalah mendahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu hari sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang hal itu yang masih diragukan adalah tentang wajibnya berpuasa pada hari itu padahal tidak wajib dilakukan bahkan yang disunnahkan adalah meninggalkannya kalau dikatakan boleh dua perkara maka sunnah untuk berbuka itu lebih utama
8597841 aku tidak mendapatkan dari ahmad bahwa beliau menegaskan wajibnya dan memerintahkannya maka janganlah pendapat diatas dinisbatkan kepadanya
8597842 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para peneliti dari kalangan madzhab hambali dan selainnya berpendapat tentang tidak wajibnya berpuasa bahkan dimakruhkan atau diharamkan
8597843 ketahuilah bahwa hari yang diragukan adalah hari ke 30 dari bulan syaban apabila tidak terlihat hilal pada malam itu karena ada awan yang menghalangi atau selainnya bisa jadi saat itu bulan ramadhan atau syaban dan makna hadits ammar dan selainnya menunjukkan atas haramnya puasa pada saat itu
8597844 janganlah kalian dahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali orang yang biasa berpuasa bertepatan pada hari itu maka puasalah
8597845 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
8597846 hadits diatas sebagai dalil bahwa shalat ied dilaksanakan hari kedua tatkala waktu ied diketahui dengan jelas sesuadah keluar habis waktu shalat

8597851 wenn ich mich recht erinnere hat die vp die gesundheitsreform platzen lassen und am n chsten tag die neuwahlen ausgerufen seit diesem zeitpunkt hat es keine gespr che ber eine reform gegeben daher werden derzeit keine schritte einer gesundheitsreform umgesetzt sie kann daher auch nicht im zeitplan liegen wenn aber kdolsky meint dass wir m glichst rasch wieder gespr che aufnehmen sollen dann ist die sp jederzeit bereit
8597852 ein wesentlicher teil der gesundheitsreform ist die finanzierungsfrage der kassen und ihre nachhaltige sicherung gerade in dieser frage hat sich die vp besonders geziert wir stimmen daher der gesundheitsministerin vollinhaltlich zu wenn sie eine entschuldung der kassen fordert die nicht zuletzt durch die politik von schwarz blau orange zwischen 2000 und 2006 finanziell stark belastet wurden um eine nachhaltige finanzierung zu erreichen ist eine erweiterung der finanzierungsbasis unumg nglich von sp seite liegen hier sehr gute vorschl ge vor wie die verm genszuwachssteuer oder eine zweckbindung der tabaksteuer ich freue mich dass bei teilen der vp langsam eine haltungs nderung vor sich zu gehen scheint

8597866 ich bin werner faymann sehr dankbar dass er als infrastrukturminister die eu richtlinie zur vorratsdatenspeicherung nicht umgesetzt hat
8597867 die eu richtlinie zur vorratsdatenspeicherung sofort au er kraft zu setzen
8597868 nicht der staat und die polizei sondern die privatwirtschaft sind die gr te datensammler
8597869 unternehmen die daten verarbeiten ohne entsprechender datensicherheit brauchen eine strengere zivilrechtlichen haftungsregelung
8597870 doch seit 2002 k nnen auch ausl ndische unternehmen derzeit 21 deutsche 1 schwedisches unkontrolliert im zmr daten abfragen und das kann das innenministerium schon gar nicht kontrollieren
8597871 derzeit k nnen keine ad quaten ausk nfte gegeben werden wo daten gelandet sind bzw woher diese kommen

8597901 the public will be angered that the home office is seeking to take serious powers that should be applied by the police and encouraging them to be given not just to local councils but also to private firms
8597902 the public want to see real police on the streets discharging these responsibilities not private firms who may use them inappropriately including unnecessarily snooping on ordinary citizens
8597903 this is a consequence of the governments obsession with policing on the cheap as well as their staggering complacency towards the extension of surveillance
8597904 it is beneficial to use accredited persons to target those community problems that are deemed unsuitable for the police because police enforcement might be seen to be excessive
8597905 this is a sinister move towards a stasi snooper state in which jobsworths are devolved the powers of the police
8597906 the potential benefits are significant they can help contribute to the delivery of neighbourhood policing that is both sustainable and really addresses the problems that local people face

8597908 halbierung der mehrwertsteuer ist sozial gerecht da menschen mit kleineren einkommen davon am meisten profitieren
8597909 niedrige einkommensschichten haben gemessen an ihrem einkommen den gr ten vorteil aus einer halbierung der mehrwertsteuer jeder euro weniger beim lebensmitteleinkauf hilft dem haushalt umso mehr je niedriger dessen einkommen ist gesamtwirtschaftlich ist die mehrwertsteuersenkung gerade bei den haushalten mit kleinen einkommen gut f r die konjunktur ihre konsumquote ist nahezu eins sie geben also fast jeden euro den sie mehr zur verf gung haben wieder aus damit wird die kaufkraft mehr gest rkt als bei steuergeschenken f r die reichen diese kaufkraftst rkung wiederum stabilisiert jetzt die konjunktur und verringert die arbeitslosigkeit
8597910 eine partei die den eingangssteuersatz bei der einkommenssteuer auf 38 angehoben hat die verm genssteuern einfach auslaufen lie und die nach auslaufen der schenkungssteuer sogar noch weitere vorteile f r stiftungen durchsetzen wollte sollte sich davor h ten die worte soziale treffsicherheit oder soziale gerechtigkeit berhaupt in den mund zu nehmen das grenzt an frivole demagogie und n tzt den belasteten b rgerinnen gar nichts
8597911 die mehrwertsteuer ist ohnehin eine regressive steuer sie belastet jene haushalte die besonders viel von ihrem einkommen f r lebensmittel ausgeben m ssen und noch dazu jeden euro mehr ungleich h her sch tzen als reichere haushalte eine entlastung die f r eine person pro monat 15 bis 20 euro mehr bringt macht auch bei familien mit mittleren einkommen einen sp rbaren unterschied zus tzlich und auch das wird in der debatte leider bersehen wirkt diese halbierung langfristig auch in zeiten in denen die lebensmittelpreise nicht mehr so stark steigen wie jetzt gelten dann 5 mehrwertsteuer damit verpufft die wirkung nicht in einem einmaleffekt sondern bleibt langfristig erhalten
8597912 molterer und co wollen den b rgerinnen scheinbar weismachen dass sie sich von kaviar und tr ffeln ern hren w rden was dann ja auch billiger w re und nur deshalb kann man die senkung nicht durchf hren ich halte das f r ausgemachten bl dsinn denn auch reichere b rgerinnen ern hren sich von brot butter und k se beim fr hst ck also jenen lebensmitteln die ganz sterreich konsumiert und die in den letzten monaten unerfreulich teuer wurden das zeigt einmal mehr die blindheit der volkspartei f r die anliegen der breiten bev lkerung
8597913 leichterer zugang zu allen vorteilen der b rgerinnen karte m glich

8597915 mit dem neuen notebook wird die nutzung von e government f r die bev lkerung erleichtert die kooperation mit fujitsu siemens computers und deren managing director wolfgang horak ist ein positives beispiel wie die wirtschaft die verbreitung von e government unterst tzen kann
8597916 sterreich ist bereits europameister im e government bereich jetzt geht es darum dass wir das angebot in der bev lkerung verbreitern das b rgerinnen notebook soll durch seine benutzerfreundlichkeit dazu beitragen dass noch mehr sterreicherinnen und sterreicher e government anwendungen nutzen

8597941 the thing im most disappointed in right now is that im going home for presenting something that wasnt me it wasnt my aesthetic

8597943 veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8597944 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8597945 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8597946 this acquisition is another sign that cisco and microsoft are on a path to fighting head to head
8597947 this marks another market in which cisco and microsoft will compete voip including unified communications and desktop video collaboration meeting webex tools set top box software and now email servers
8597948 our experience tells us that when two technology giants collide the winner is the end buyer pricing generally goes down while innovation accelerates both bad for margins
8597949 we dont believe microsoft is scared of a tough fight neither is cisco
8597950 microsoft and cisco battling will most likely not be a winning situation for shareholders as it could be bloody
8597951 we have always held that email is a critical part of a unified communications solution and we have a 15 year head start in delivering email
8597952 we think this acquisition represents a validation of the way we have defined and viewed this market
8597953 complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future

8597959 the routine blood pressure and blood tests they test your sugar and cholesterol levels
8597960 dont get me wrong it is important to get these tests done but screening for disease is hardly a wellness program
8597961 we also are providing free flu shots and subsidizing gym memberships we are also looking to create some company sporting teams to play in some social competitions
8597962 what we really want to know is how can we have a healthier lifestyle and work these long hours and still be able to enjoy times with our friends and family

8597972 we want students to give us feedback we want people to tell us what their favorite site is so that we can continue in our evaluation
8597973 weve been curious to see what copyright holders would choose would the vast majority of partners block user uploaded videos or would they embrace video id as an opportunity to generate revenue and exposure for their content online
8597974 as it turns out our partners are choosing the latter monetising 90 per cent of all claims created through video id

8598026 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8598027 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8598028 the only reason she did it is because she had a psychotic breakdown this is something that could have happened to anyone
8598029 i think its because they can see that she was sick and this wasnt somebody thinking in her right mind you know doing these things

8598039 se asocian con lo que la gente conoce como guerrilla
8598040 equipos policiales especializados como existen en zonas de colombia espa a y centroam rica
8598041 nos hemos apoyado en el mapeo del instituto geogr fico militar y en la fuerza a rea con la obtenci n de im genes aerofotogram tricas
8598042 apoyos en los trazados y determinar d nde se pueden localizar de manera m s o menos permanente porque no pueden mantener residencia con alguna fijeza dado que las diligencias podr an llegar a identificarlos
8598043 tenemos informaci n y una investigaci n adicional para asociar si este tipo de grupos corresponden a los que han actuado en la zona puede ser un grupo mayor que se divide y parcializa la realizaci n de estos hechos el adversario compartimentaliza muy bien la informaci n
8598044 no tenemos los antecedentes tenemos que enfrentar el trabajo con una intensa inteligencia policial para infiltrar a estos grupos
8598045 lo visto hace presumir que tienen una planificaci n a la usanza de lo que podr amos conocer como una suerte guerrilla
8598046 la primera manifestaci n concreta de un trabajo planificado ocurri con el atentado a luchsinger en junio de 2005 luego otros tienen caracter sticas similares con mando vestuario ad hoc tareas segmentadas armamento y actos de poca duraci n existir an atisbos de formaci n
8598047 el nico dato es que en el campamento de lumaco quemado la persona que hac a de l der ten a un timbre de voz similar al de peruanos o bolivianos e incluso uno de los testigos dice que podr a ser centroamericano se ha monitoreado el ingreso de personas desde el extranjero que podr an estar llegando al pa s con motivo de participar en tareas de preparaci n lo que no est confirmado
8598048 asumimos este tipo de casos cuando se produce el hecho estamos un poco a la zaga en esa materia la dificultad como ministerio p blico es la dependencia muy directa de la efectividad de los resultados policiales la propia polic a debe desarrollar los mecanismos para llevar adelante el cumplimiento de las instrucciones
8598049 desconozco el grado interno de relaci n y direcci n de estos temas la informaci n que manejamos es a trav s de los equipos policiales que trabajan con los fiscales y dependiendo las pocas han sido m s o menos significativos en cuanto al n mero y al aporte lo que hemos demandado es que se requiere a nivel pa s una polic a profesional que tenga asignados funcionarios determinados tal como en drogas o delitos sexuales
8598050 no s si tendr n ese car cter por ahora pero nuestro pa s debe madurar en ese sentido y tomar experiencias del extranjero es una realidad que hay que enfrentar

8598059 its not like the biggest travel or anything its only 3in but the back end stays nice and tight nice and short and its no surprise the tyre will never hit the back of the seat or the seat tube this bike is an all around bike and im stoked to get it out
8598060 this has been my concept and just thinking back to slopestyles and filming grabbing one bike and grabbing the other bike and both of those bikes feeling totally different i wanted both of them to feel the same so thats how i came up with this design as i wanted the back end to never change and we put the shock as the top tube and its a real fun bike its nice and rigid its a concept of mine and cannondale made it a reality

8598066 so far the labor market has been unmoved by the weakening in economic momentum
8598067 after tet there was a massive shift from combat avoidance to mutiny
8598068 mutiny became so common that the army was forced to disguise its frequency by talking instead of combat refusal
8598069 resembled a strike and occurred when gis refused disobeyed or negotiated an order into combat
8598070 unlike mutinous outbreaks of the past which were usually sporadic short lived events the progressive unwillingness of american soldiers to fight to the point of open disobedience took place over a four year period between 1968 71
8598071 it was an organized strike a shaken brass relieved the company commander but they did not charge the guys with anything the brass surrendered to the strength of the organized men

8598076 the r8 is the first production audi bearing the name and genes of a successful racing sportscar and is therefore an excellent base from which to build up our first big customer sport programme
8598077 ever since the r8 was unveiled weve been inundated with enquiries about a race version with the latest reviews
8598078 i cant see how science can explain where goodness comes from
8598079 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8598080 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8598081 i dont want to talk about sanctions myself ahead of time when the meeting itself has not taken place but we are working with our 26 partners at this moment
8598082 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8598083 its hard to get rhythm there because they are switching quarterbacks all the time
8598084 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8598085 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood
8598086 we will be ready to make decisions including in the united nations on additional increases in the number of international monitors clarifying their mandate and possibly other steps with international participation
8598087 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8598088 we are sorry about this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8598089 we will see how this will develop we are sticking strictly to the conditions on the timetable for the russian fleets presence there
8598090 now we have people flexing their muscles demonstrating force we can only regret that
8598091 what can i do about it apart from win games and keep going ive had this now for a little while ill get on with it im a big boy as ive said before
8598092 the fans are brilliant when they are behind us and they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us it can all change at the weekend
8598093 football is a bit like this you go through periods like this it has happened to other managers and happened a bit last year
8598094 the disappointing thing is the players are the ones that have to go out and perform
8598095 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8598096 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8598097 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
8598098 concerned about the latest changes in south ossetia and abkhazia
8598099 of course they cars cannot be compared to bmw or volkswagen but for a small price you will be able to buy one heck of a car
8598100 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8598101 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war but we of course dont want it
8598102 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west
8598103 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision and the situation will be calm
8598104 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8598105 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
8598106 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8598107 this simply will be dead on arrival in the u n security council
8598108 contrary to the principles of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8598109 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
8598110 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8598111 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
8598112 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8598113 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8598114 we fled fr m our homes only th se of us who could hide yesterday are safe now others were beaten up
8598115 a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 they are past that now
8598116 if they feel that a western orientation is not an option they will be looking for friends where they can find them starting with tehran and caracas
8598117 i think you will now see a more unified position that russia is clearly overstepping its bounds and must be contained
8598118 im not saying we should support them secessionist movements in russia im saying thats a potential option
8598119 if the russians are playing a dirty game we shouldnt be a nice guy this is not a vicars tea party
8598120 critically but also very very sadly russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region
8598121 the president of russia has said he was not afraid of a new cold war we do not want a new cold war and he has a big responsibility not to start one we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8598122 i do not apologise for rejecting knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g8 or for eu russia relations to be broken but we do need to examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8598123 doj seeks reduced sentence for abramoff in d c corruption case

8598126 the unfortunate thing is that the high price of fuel and the recession are accomplishing things that the traffic safety community couldnt accomplish
8598127 that is a silver lining to something thats very bad news to american families and to the economy

8598218 you cant be too careful in todays society what with mexican kidnappers tsa gropers and democrats for obama running around doing whatever they want its every woman for themselves anymore
8598219 i may just be one dentist out of the four of five who recommend chewing gum but that doesnt mean im not worried about societies trends ive got investments in silicone valley and in silicon implants so i might set off metal detectors and get accosted at an airport i may have to divest to avoid the risk if i can find a plan that allows me to swap silicon breast implants for an electronic transmitter so i can be tracked if im kidnapped by democrats i might just do that
8598220 kidnappings and gropings have been going on since time began and its not like its anything new or something to be afraid of
8598221 what woman hasnt been groped or kidnapped at least once or twice in the last six months well i suppose there are some but none who havent at least thought about it
8598222 in april of this year bear stearns estimated that there are 20 million illegal immigrants in the u s and while thats bad enough in itself some of these people are known to be hezbollah operatives who paid mexican smugglers to get them into the country
8598223 legal mexicans are establishing systems so that they can be tracked and tsa is busting big busted women out of fear that their boobs are about to blow meanwhile american borders are porous and for a couple thousand dollars you can buy a fake passport and id and get smuggled into the u s so you can build your base of operations and prepare to spring out and attack all at once this shit is what people ought to be paying attention to once you understand that iran created and finances hezbollah and they want to bring the us and israel down you get a better understanding of what were up against what i need is a big busted tsa woman to take my mind off all this i wonder how i can track one down

8598229 you cant discuss curing cancer and an adam sandler movie in the same context its more than absurd
8598230 there is no platform for a comparative discussion about the two i dont exist as a being in any true format and this conversation is completely superfluous if i actually existed id own a dog and be in pursuit of a playboy bunny like everybody else but thats not the case im not usually this crabby but babes bunnies and dogs are important and shouldnt be taken so lightly that writers invent shallow characters like me to discuss them im very disappointed
8598231 ive gotten sick watching movies a lot of times not cancer i dont think because i dont live with a dog that can tell me that but the two do share the same contextual space on occasion
8598232 i like movies and dogs and am against all illnesses i guess im simple that way thats why i like adam sandler you dont have to be too bright to watch his flicks of course you cant expect much from them no matter what your iq is
8598233 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
8598234 a guy with a good dog and a porn star relationship has all his needs met except for food and shelter

8598236 ich bin nicht nur sehr erleichtert ich bin froh dass das gericht sich nicht auf die argumentation der anderen seite eingelassen hat dass der tendenzschutz des unternehmens h her zu bewerten ist als der sonderk ndigungsschutz eines betriebsratsmitgliedes
8598237 die eindeutige entscheidung best tigt unsere vermutung dass es sich um eine reine provokation der arbeitgeberseite und um einen psychokrieg handelt elke soll durch diese taktik resignieren aber wer sie so einsch tzt kennt sie nicht und untersch tzt zudem unsere belegschaft den betriebsrat und die berbetriebliche solidarit t durch viele betriebsr te und ver di mitglieder anderer verlage in hamburg
8598238 es ist nicht nur ein mehrheitliches gef hl der bev lkerung dass sie vom aufschwung nicht profitiert es ist realit t trotz eines gut dreij hrigen konjunkturaufschwungs ist die reale einkommenssituation vieler haushalte heute schlechter als zuvor
8598239 der erzwungene verzicht auf angemessene an inflationsziel und produktivit tssteigerung orientierte lohnsteigerungen hat sich nicht gelohnt
8598240 letztlich waren die unternehmen bei guter internationaler und nationaler konjunktur nicht gezwungen die geringen arbeitskostensteigerungen vollst ndig in den preisen weiterzugeben und diese bei einrechnung der produktivit tsfortschritte entsprechend zu senken stattdessen konnten sie ihre gewinnmargen erh hen
8598241 konnte der aufschwung von den unternehmen dieses mal f r eine massive umverteilung zu ihren gunsten genutzt werden

8598272 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
8598273 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8598274 grant was expelled from beaconsfield secondary school in the fourth year probably age about 15 for persistent disruptive behaviour

8598280 contactpoint will improve services to young people including safeguarding vulnerable children it will not exist to detect crimes nor be open for users to trawl for prosecution evidence
8598281 to access contactpoint to prevent or detect crime or for the prosecution of offenders police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a clear exceptional case for disclosure this will be decided on a case by case basis
8598282 it makes a mockery of any idea of parent child confidentiality its one thing to say police need access to fight crime its another to create a database for the protection of children and then use it across government this was never about the protection of children
8598283 whitehalls system infrastructure needs to undergo radical surgery before the government can be seen as a respectful user of both new technology and personal information this government has a legacy of using technology to acquire information without vision on what it is used for how it will be used who will use it how it will be stored and how it will be secured
8598284 liberty is concerned that putting every child on the database might make it more difficult to identify the truly vulnerable because of the vast amount of data which must be sifted through unfortunately it seems that increasingly the rationale behind contactpoint is not child protection but the creation of another mass surveillance database
8598285 contactpoint records will only ever hold very basic identifying information and will not contain case notes and young peoples details will only remain on the database after their 18th birthday with their informed explicit consent

8598296 mind the mummy gap i have slipped into that gap before not so deeply nor so suddenly that i could not clutch the edge on my way down and haul myself back up scrabbling undignified and tearful but when my mum fell into it when the precious little bits of her life began to slide through her fingers so that she lost her grip she plummeted into the dark so low we could not reach her so low it took her months and months to clamber back to the light she skirts an abyss and we watch ever fearful that she might fall again she does from time to time i wonder had she seen the gap coming had somebody warned her preferably some time before my youngest sister left home for boarding school hey look out theres a sodding great hole there mind you dont fall into it would she have navigated her way around left herself a wide enough berth that even if she stood back unaware in an unguarded moment itd still be far enough away not to pose a threat i know how chilly its unfathomable depths are because mum has described them to me its cold she has said and dark i only know that i need to watch my step because of her it doesnt mean i wont fall too but if you have been cautioned mind the gap you might just might have time to plot a course around it im working on a story about gaps and direction madness and motherhood if you any of you kind readers could bear to link to this id love to hear from anybody who is familiar with sidestepping gaps or not
8598297 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8598298 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8598299 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8598300 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8598301 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8598302 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8598303 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8598304 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8598305 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8598315 we have come up with a scheme that will allow people a much longer period to plan and pay for their tickets while still continuing the battle against ticket touting

8598317 so far the labor market has been unmoved by the weakening in economic momentum
8598318 by the winter at the latest the labor market is set to react to the weaker economic situation
8598319 its actually inspired by a swedish film about two lesbians
8598320 theyre teenagers and its a story about them discovering love and how they feel about other girls in school they get teased by the other kids and then they decide f k everyone were going to do this we dont care what you think
8598321 thats what the songs about not caring what other people think about your boyfriend or girlfriend

8598326 a lot of kids told me later they used that video in discussions in other classes

8598333 were more open about approaching and bringing services in to ps3 and psp
8598334 we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
8598335 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources not necessarily getting people to pay but with advertising and so on

8598345 i love to watch people who can do something really well you love to see a homerun hitter hit a homerun you like to see michael phelps swim bill clinton knows how to make a political speech and this was really a classic he touched all the bases he was funny he socked it to the republicans he explained his support and the work hillary clinton did in her historic race for this i cant believe the obama people could want any more than what they got from bill clinton tonight
8598346 barack obama is ready to lead and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8598347 my fellow democrats 16 years ago you gave me the profound honor to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8598348 will nominate a good man but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8598349 power of our example than the example of our power
8598350 the speech he offered could have been a joint release from the economic policy institute and the center for american policy foreign affairs department but somehow when clinton reads it policy slips free of the weighty terms and looping sentences that press it down and drifts upward to read easily as part of the human condition engaged with our everyday experience its a remarkable skill and one that no other current politician possesses

8598402 i am satisfied that we are managing to maintain our top line growth and increase in margins in the first half of this year despite a challenging economic environment a spanish presidential election process and the weakness of the u s dollar currency our customers continue to rely on our technology solutions for a sustainable and secure world as demonstrated by our bookings these solid bookings and backlog along with the strong pipeline also give us confidence for the rest of 2008

8598461 lo principal es evitar que avancen ciertas enfermedades que causan disfunciones en los m sculos del coraz n entre ellas la ic que padece entre el 1 y 2 por ciento de la poblaci n general para poder cumplir ese objetivo hay varias cosas a tener en cuenta por un lado el control riguroso y la adhesi n a un tratamiento farmacol gico por parte de aquellas personas que presentan miocardiopat as o cardiopat as determinadas gen ticamente es decir ligadas a la herencia
8598462 por otra parte pensando en todo el resto de la poblaci n que no presenta condiciones preexistentes es necesario trabajar en la prevenci n destacando que poner en marcha determinados cambios en el estilo de vida como por ejemplo seguir una dieta equilibrada y saludable o controlar peri dicamente la presi n arterial contribuye a evitar condiciones m s severas a futuro
8598463 hay una gran cantidad de enfermedades que libradas a su evoluci n y sin que se ejerzan los controles debidos evolucionan en ic una de las m s frecuentes es la hipertensi n arterial por eso es tan importante trabajar con los especialistas y sobre todo mantener un buen peso para evitar complicaciones en el caso de las cuestiones heredadas que no pueden prevenirse lo m s recomendable es llevar adelante un tratamiento minucioso para evitar las descompensaciones que suelen culminan en internaciones por lo general las descompensaciones se producen cuando el paciente abandona el tratamiento farmacol gico o bien cuando no sigue su dieta

8598473 we do not have all of the data right now but we know that nm100060 was safe with no adverse events novartis is in the early stages of reviewing the data and may take two to three months to generate the final report for competitive reasons novartis has asked us not to release any information regarding the specific results they will publish those results at a later time according to industry standards in the meantime novartis is continuing with a comparator study in europe which will be completed in early 2009 with results in mid 2009
8598474 this news is disappointing to us however it is important to note that the agreement with novartis is still in place so long as this agreement is in place and we believe that it will remain so we are entitled to receive the anticipated 3 5 million when our pending u s patent claim is allowed we expect this to take place soon in addition we have been told by novartis that should the results from the study in europe be deemed sufficient to file in europe they may pursue european approval first we would then be entitled to those milestones the european patent office has allowed the claim on our application this does not trigger a milestone but it does insure us full royalty payments for sales in those countries with patent coverage

8598503 we are judged on results wins and losses its not good right now we know that but there are only a few ways to improve a team aside from your own home grown talent and thats trades and free agency
8598504 i dont think much more could have been done through free agency we have made trades and we will explore that possibility in the off season again and of course the light has to come on for our younger players here they have to become impact players theyre not there yet

8598510 what i try to put into everything i do is to have something thats driving the story forward and to see that the individual chapters are self sustaining and are as powerful as we can make them i wanted the story to have some dramatic power something to hold you i wanted the little side missions which are a staple of casual games to be a little more organic in some casual games they can get a little sloppy at least in wmc the little things such as the parts where you have to mix the chemicals in the lab have some relevance to the main story

8598812 we reported an overall increase in revenue of 3 4 percent from the comparable quarter of the prior year however excluding the top line benefits provided by favorable foreign currency exchange rates our revenue declined 3 9 percent revenue from key new products most notably our sign making and specialty graphics segments wide format uv inkjet printer the solara ion tm and continued strong sales performance from our spandex distribution operations helped to mitigate the negative effects of significant market softness in our other primary businesses in comparison to the same quarter of the prior year our gross margin was impacted by lower production volumes and an unfavorable product mix the product mix in the first quarter reflected a significant drop in high margin software sales and a higher percentage of lower margin distribution sales due to the strong revenue growth of our spandex business which continues to outpace the growth of our higher margin manufacturing businesses combined these factors accounted for the 3 1 percentage point reduction in gross profit margin and lower net income compared with the first quarter of the prior year
8598813 this was a challenging quarter for the company we decided to act quickly and aggressively in response to the current market softness and as a result have already taken actions including the previously announced workforce reductions in early august 2008 in order to position us to continuously improve our operating margins although the current global economic outlook continues to be uncertain we anticipate that the success of new products and the cost reduction initiatives taken will allow us to deliver sustainable earnings growth in fiscal year 2009

8598959 we have continued to cut costs and improve the responsiveness of our operations
8598960 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants while the travel trailer division also had a loss quarter its performance was improved over the prior year the housing group remained profitable despite the challenging environment in that industry
8598961 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8598962 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates considering the current business climate we are pleased with the turnout indicated for our rv national dealer meeting next week we will be showcasing our newest products with innovative floor plans and exciting decor packages although we expect dealers to remain cautious for the foreseeable future we are eager to demonstrate to them why fleetwood remains an excellent choice as their business partner going forward
8598963 we believe that once the excess inventory of site built housing begins to clear the prospects for manufactured housing should improve
8598964 also the housing bill recently passed by congress contains several positives for our industry which should continue to narrow the gap between site built and manufactured housing lending practices we expect the difficult environment to continue for at least a couple more quarters however as shipments continue to lag throughout the country particularly in the retirement states of california arizona and florida in the meantime our trendsetter modular division has substantially completed two military contracts at fort bliss and fort sill and is in advanced stages of negotiations for additional similar contracts we have received positive feedback on our involvement to date and we expect to continue to participate in the armys military housing renovation plans
8598965 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows for fleetwood through that same period
8598966 we continue to aggressively pursue cost reductions and carefully manage production and inventories while still investing in new and improved products based on customer feedback
8598967 despite a modest but unavoidable build up of motor home chassis and finished goods inventories in the first quarter cash and marketable investments totaled 85 7 million at july 27 2008 with virtually no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
8598968 since then we have raised an additional 26 5 million from real estate financing a successful refinancing of the 5 debentures is the next step in our strategy to put fleetwood in a position of strength relative to current economic conditions and posture the company for an advantageous future we believe in the long term strength and viability of both our industries and look forward to continuing our participation as a leader in each as the markets recover
8598969 our solid second quarter operating results reflect the ongoing success of our merchandising strategies and excellent execution across the board from our team given our positive momentum strong positioning in the marketplace and easier comparisons which continue through the second half of the year we are optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year although we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment accordingly we have modestly raised our expectations for the balance of the year

8599055 the initial risk was that open source would hold hichert back but he leveraged it to make it work for his needs
8599056 joining astaros partner program allows resellers to take advantage of a newly built field channel marketing team resources training as well as aggressive margins of up to 40 percent
8599057 more mid size businesses are relying on the internet mission critical security is more urgent for them a small business can fail because of that

8599078 a pst file is a file access driven method of message storage file access driven means that the computer uses special file access commands that the operating system provides to read and write data to the file this is not efficient on wan or lan links because wan lan links use network access driven methods commands the operating system provides to send data to or receive from another networked computer if there is a remote pst over a network link microsoft outlook tries to use the file commands to read from the file or write to the file but the operating system then has to send those commands over the network because the file is not on the local computer this creates a great deal of overhead and increases the time it takes to read and write to the file additionally the use of a pst file over a network connection may result in a corrupted pst file if the connection degrades or fails
8599079 storesonline is thrilled to support and enable such a wonderful cause the oas program empowers children with asthma with the right tools and training to not only survive their asthma but really thrive
8599080 starting out many of these kids dont want anyone to know they have asthma because it labels them or makes them feel embarrassed however after attending oas they see they are not alone and they gain the skills and confidence to fully participate in activities they previously had avoided
8599081 this program helps empower the children to take ownership of their asthma and learn key skills and techniques to help them in everyday situations they learn about their medications and the importance of taking them when and how they should
8599082 my daughter never complains about taking her puffer inhaler in public anymore she knows more about her symptoms and knows what she needs to do in any possible situation before the oas program my daughter used to call home every day from school complaining about her asthma after the oas program she stopped calling home was no longer scared to take her medications and she learned strategies to help her relax when she was having a difficult time breathing
8599083 it is our goal to expand this program in the coming years so more schools and children outside the wasatch front have the opportunity to benefit from oas we look forward to our continued relationship with storesonline and encourage other businesses to get involved in this life changing program
8599084 as a business storesonline is committed to making a difference by providing entrepreneurs and small business owners the tools and training they need to survive and thrive on the internet getting behind and supporting an entrepreneurially driven program like oas is a natural extension of our company values as oas is also focused on providing the right tools and training so children with asthma can also survive and thrive in school and in life

8599113 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8599114 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8599115 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8599116 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8599117 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8599118 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8599119 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8599120 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8599121 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8599122 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8599123 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8599124 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8599125 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8599126 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8599127 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8599128 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8599129 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8599130 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8599131 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8599132 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8599135 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8599136 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8599137 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8599138 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8599140 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8599141 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent

8599146 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8599147 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8599148 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8599151 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8599152 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8599153 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8599154 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8599155 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8599156 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business

8599288 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8599289 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8599293 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8599294 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8599295 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8599296 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8599305 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8599308 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8599309 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8599310 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8599311 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8599312 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8599313 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8599314 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8599315 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8599316 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8599317 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8599318 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8599319 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8599320 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8599321 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8599322 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8599323 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8599324 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8599325 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8599326 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8599327 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8599328 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8599329 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8599330 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8599331 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8599332 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8599333 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8599338 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8599339 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8599340 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8599341 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8599342 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8599343 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8599344 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8599345 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8599346 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8599347 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8599348 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8599349 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8599350 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8599351 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8599352 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8599353 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8599354 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8599355 who are open to doing something on the production side
8599356 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8599357 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8599358 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8599363 wir haben ihn seit sechs tagen im auge wir glauben dass es ein spieler ist der uns weiterhelfen kann
8599364 der spieler ist fit da in italien die saison auch jetzt losgeht
8599365 es ist im moment nicht so dass es sich in ruhe arbeiten l sst wir m ssen jetzt schnell erfolg haben damit sich alles beruhigt

8599370 i think the same about his wife were very fortunate to have them following eight years of the worst president in american history
8599371 ich glaube an miro klose doch ich erwarte von ihm eine leistungssteigerung er muss jetzt mal explodieren auch miro wird an seinen leistungen gemessen aber wenn er fit ist hat er eine unglaubliche ausgeglichenheit
8599372 so fr h m chte ich mich nicht festlegen das h ngt schon davon ab in welcher form er anreist und wie er trainiert
8599373 das macht man eigentlich nur bei spielern die k rperlich richtig angeschlagen sind aber miro ist ja k rperlich belastbar
8599374 das mag sein aber er hat gesagt dass er k rperlich wieder auf ein hohes niveau muss dann wird er mit sicherheit wieder der alte klose
8599375 wenn er wieder die weiten wege gehen kann wird er treffen und als vorbereiter gl nzen das muss er bald schaffen und nicht erst in weiter ferne
8599376 wir alle glauben an ihn wir sch tzen unseren spieler miro wei dass er sich auf uns verlassen kann
8599377 dass miro nat rlich besser spielen muss da sind wir uns alle einig
8599378 gek mpft und gearbeitet das w rde ich miro auch empfehlen
8599379 matt and andy have had their eye on setting up a pub for ages when the property came on the market they had to have it

8599383 kalau melihat sepintas dia sosok yang sederhana tidak banyak lagak tak seorang pun mengira dia adalah pimpinan program senjata kuman irak
8599384 di irak kemungkinan besar terjadi aktivitas uji coba menjijikkan termasuk eksperimen tidak bermoral terhadap bintang dan manusia
8599385 ia malah tidak ragu ragu menampilkan diri sebagai otak dibalik senjata biologi irak ia seolah tidak merasakan kecemasan dunia atas perilaku buruknya

8599389 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8599390 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8599391 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world

8599397 meskipun dalam tubuh yang seperti ini aku masih sekuat yang biasa lho
8599398 ini adalah mantera yang pernah menyegelmu dan itu akan kulakukan lagi
8599399 kau pikir jurus yang sama akan mempan untuk yang kedua kalinya hah percuma
8599400 apalagi dengan tubuh yang lemah seperti itu kau pasti akan mati ling yao
8599401 aku tidak lagi sendirian sekarang jadi sekarang kalian tak usah khawatir akan apa yang akan terjadi padaku aku akan baik baik saja ling orang yang baik ia akan menjagaku seperti kalian menyayangiku

8599408 dan sekarang seperti bisa anda saksikan peristiwa luar biasa yang tidak bisa dijelaskan dengan nalar manusia dua orang pria bertarung dengan hebatnya seperti di film film perlu anda ketahui ini bukanlah trik kamera maupun spesial efek kami menyajikan berita langsung dari lokasi dan diketahui bahwa yang bertarung adalah ling yao seorang buronan intenasional dan seorang wni yang menurut penyelidikan bernama ryan pratama tampaknya ia adalah pemain baru dalam jaringan teroris internasional kami juga menduga adanya konfrontasi antara
8599409 kaulah yang membunuh kedua orangtuaku tapi kenapa kau datang mencariku

8599411 nona tolonglah berkenaan dengan peringatan tentang bencana itu dari siapa nona mengetahuinya
8599412 in less than a decade weve gone from being perceived as being the beacon of democracy and justice all over the globe to a country whose government has little respect even for the most basic tenants of human rights
8599413 serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
8599414 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8599415 moscow alleges that there atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
8599416 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8599417 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8599418 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8599419 it is my understanding that in this case it was a 20 cent cable connection that disabled the entire site
8599420 while there are kinks in any new system i am becoming more and more concerned as to the level of redundancy built into the irp system and whether there are sufficient resources to troubleshoot problems that will occur
8599421 as new agencies come on the irp system were going to find glitches
8599422 we just need to figure out how to make sure it doesnt happen again
8599423 it is our responsibility to make sure it works right
8599424 due to the lack of confidence in the system marion county will be working toward a non digital high band system that we feel is more reliable
8599425 we feel the digital system may have good potential one cay but not yet
8599426 we are not willing to put live on the line for a good idea
8599427 the system we have is like two cans and a string
8599428 analog voice intelligibility quality or better in digital radios particularly in those areas tested where firefighter communication is paramount to their survival
8599429 as good as if not better than the current analog system
8599430 the benefits of the new radios far outweighed the risk
8599431 it was designed for inter agency communication during federal emergency levels three four or five
8599432 i have a problem switching over to a system not made for day to day operations
8599433 i dont want to find out it doesnt work while on an emergency
8599434 do we want the sixth to be in kanawha county
8599435 i am greatly concerned for the safety of firefighters and emergency personnel in kanawha county
8599436 it certainly benefits everyone to be able to talk to each other especially during emergency situations
8599437 i think it is important to stress our commitment and goal of ensuring emergency situations have effective and seamless communications and an interoperable system while not flawless certainly assists first responders and emergency officials statewide and across state borders with the ability to communicate in crises situations
8599438 communications is critical to the success of any and all operations and we certainly have no desire to implement a system that puts anybodys life in danger continued dialogue among all parties remains necessary as we move forward with the states interoperable efforts
8599439 wistful or excessively sentimental yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition
8599440 we received the information from the italian authorities yesterday in the form of a draft text for the privatisation plans for alitalia
8599441 at this stage it would be quite unwise to make any substantive comments on the text itself
8599442 is still scheduled but we cannot prejudge any discussions that take place next week
8599443 you have strep b which isnt a big deal 50 of women have it youll just need to get to the hospital early enough to get antibiotics
8599444 you have strep b your baby may die only 15 of women have it youll need to get to the hospital early so that you can be tied down to the bed for hours which will stop your labor and inevitably end in a c section and hopefully your baby wont die
8599445 she seems very active but i bet lots of babies do
8599446 um this is by far one of the most active babies i have ever seen
8599447 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8599448 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8599449 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept
8599450 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations
8599451 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8599452 the presidents confirmed their commitment to the principle of respecting the historical and cultural traditions of each country and efforts aimed at maintaining the unity of states and their territorial integrity
8599453 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8599454 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8599455 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8599456 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8599457 eating school lunch costs an extra twenty five cents this year school officials say thats the largest increase they have seen in awhile and parents are hoping it doesnt continue to rise so rapidly
8599458 frankfurts book should be required reading for anyone whose speech or writing are intended for public consumption
8599459 posteriormente visitaremos la planta de sidor en puerto ordaz ya que tenemos firmado un convenio de suministro de acero
8599460 leave the system alone if i can do it anyone can
8599461 police officers tell me to stop driving like a clown
8599462 and i like to create different things i went to art school and acting school in new york
8599463 soy estudiante de la universidad aut noma de m xico
8599464 que condicionaron su atenci n m dica si no respond a lo que ellos quer an
8599465 nicas testigos que el ecuador tiene para demostrar c mo el ej rcito colombiano atac el territorio nacional
8599466 en primer lugar yo no conozco detalles de la denuncia dada por el abogado le n rold s aguilera espero leerla para poder comentar puntualmente pero en t rminos generales estimo que lo que est haciendo le n rold s es un esc ndalo may sculo sin mayores argumentos es hacer una suerte de tormenta en un vaso de agua no creo que se deba aclarar absolutamente todo o que haya que transparentar todo es algo relativamente f cil en la asamblea constituyente de montecristi a diferencia del texto de 1998 realizada en sangolqu est absolutamente todo documentado y todo es absolutamente transparente
8599467 s he encontrado algunos cambios y los he hecho p blicos en su momento dado siempre ech de menos un art culo en el que se constitu a un consejo ciudadano de visi n estrat gica que se lo resumi en un consejo ciudadano de plural
8599468 ah se cometieron algunos errores de buena fe e incluir a que la velocidad con la que se aprobaron los textos y se cometieron esos errores es por eso que yo me separ de la presidencia de la asamblea porque yo prefer a hacer las cosas m s calmadas y con m s tiempo sin embargo los errores que se presentan son corregibles no son sustanciales
8599469 adicionalmente se les dio otra tarea que se le introdujo en el reglamento oficial el 10 de julio la que consist a en hacer una serie de propuestas concretas y que posteriormente estuvieron consideradas en el pleno de la asamblea y si la memoria no me falla de las 15 propuestas presentadas por la comisi n redactora 6 de ellas fueron aceptadas entonces yo no creo que haya nada raro ac y lamento que mi amigo el abogado rold s se haya dedicado simplemente a ver las ramas
8599470 la primera fase que arranc el d a de hoy aunque estamos todav a en la etapa de algunos ajustes t cnicos se complementar luego con red de repetidoras en otras ciudades del ecuador primero vamos a transmitir quito guayaquil cuenca y manta tendr su se al aut noma es decir propia independiente y asistido los servicios informativos y programas que puedan ser de inter s nacional se cubrir n desde su origen
8599471 la siguiente fase tenemos el inter s de desarrollar repetidoras en las principales capitales de provincia incluyendo la provincia insular de gal pagos y por supuesto transmitirlo por v a internet no simult neamente como la gran mayor a de las emisoras lo hacen si no que sea un producto de inter s propio y aut nomo con el mismo sentido de servicio comunitario hacia los ecuatorianos residentes en el extranjero
8599472 radio p blica del ecuador es un producto nuevo es un medio p blico desarrollado con el objetivo de servir a todos los sectores y sustentando con los recursos y presupuestos propios asignados inicialmente por un aporte del bede y luego con asignaciones que vendr de la superintendencia de telecomunicaci n y por la publicidad
8599473 que no tenga la interferencia publicitaria proveniente por ejemplo de un banco con un fin de lucro y que por alguna u otra raz n a futuro esta tenga injerencia sobre la decisi n o el manejo que pueda tener un medio de alguna manera cuando hay crisis bancarias como la ocurrida hace 10 a os atr s
8599474 la radio es la magia de que la imaginaci n de cada ser y m s aun los talentos y las capacidades de las personas que hemos reunido para formar parte de este equipo inicial fundador de este proceso que apunta a ofrecer programas que tal vez en una radio privada tendr a que tener un auspicio para sostener la producci n de texto investigaci n y locuci n todo lo que significa poner un producto radiof nico al aire
8599475 there is no question crp is in jeopardy of heading down the soil bank path if we dont address the programs economic viability given the landscape of todays agricultural market
8599476 rules regulations appropriations and promotion of conservation programs are all critical to the magic of turning law into habitat on the land
8599477 south dakota agriculture and our states economy depend on crp and other conservation easement programs for protection of marginal land and to provide habitat for pheasants and other game species
8599478 farm bill conservation practices have become an integral part of nearly every farming operation in south dakota and we shouldnt be diminishing their effectiveness by allowing their useful life to end prematurely
8599479 por lo menos suena una alarma sobre la seguridad gen tica de la tecnolog a de reproducci n asistida
8599480 este verano el deporte m s peligroso es la bicicleta
8599481 en este caso en particular hemos recibido a la corte suprema a su presidente y a unos pocos magistrados m s para conocer de cerca para que el consejo de c mara les d un espacio de consulta y opini n y adem s tener los argumentos de juicio para saber qu es lo que est pasando respecto a un tema que nos preocupa much simo el referente a la seguridad jur dica
8599482 los emprendedores del pa s hemos sido v ctimas de la inseguridad jur dica porque cuando aquella esta persistente en el escenario pol tico o p blico las inversiones decrecen y esto implica decrecimiento de nuevos emprendimientos y sobre todo un decrecimiento en la generaci n de nuevas plazas de trabajo
8599483 el conocer de la gente experta en la administraci n de justicia de c mo ven ellos las cosas la preocupaci n que tiene con respecto al r gimen de transici n y al hecho de que puedan ser cesados miembros de la corte inclusive aquello que se denomina la t mbola el sorteo es decir hemos auscultado su preocupaci n en referencia a la justicia en el pa s a nosotros nos preocupa supremamente el tema porque si no hay seguridad jur dica si la cosas no van claras las inversiones decrecen la econom a se ve afectada
8599484 que es importante clarificar si va o no el r gimen de transici n dentro del texto constitucional que va a ser consultado al pueblo el pr ximo 28 de septiembre por eso hacemos ese tipo de acciones en democracia
8599485 el tema est politizado ya entonces es complicado establecer exactamente d nde est la verdad pero yo pienso y lo he manifestado as que el aula magna de la cat lica contrario a lo que se diga a veces en m poca al menos diez a os de rector a donde fueron pol ticos etc no fueron ni barras ni se la prest para fines de temas pol ticos
8599486 es una cadena que est reiterada todos los s bados se sabe c mo es la cadena por lo tanto esa cadena no es acad mica es pol tica y pienso que no se debi prestar el aula magna para ese tipo de actos
8599487 pero comenzando por all pienso que no se debi haber hecho este acto ah eso primero
8599488 si la inteligencia policial o militar detect previamente que podr an haber incidentes entonces ten an que haberle mandado una comunicaci n al rector dici ndole en prevenci n de incidentes pedimos a usted que un cuerpo policial vaya a la universidad y entonces podr an haber mandado porque la polic a sabe hacer muy bien las cosas cuando quiere hacerlo
8599489 la inteligencia deb a haberle dicho al presidente de la rep blica va a haber tal cosa o va a haber tal otra cosa vaya en estas condiciones hay que preservar la situaci n del presidente de la rep blica
8599490 la polic a en mi opini n no ha estado organizada para un acto acad mico la polic a ha ido ah ya a ver o la mandaron ya porque sab an que iba a pasar algo o fue ya cuando estaba armada media gresca all y estaba a dos cuadras de distancia pero el presidente de la rep blica sale del aula magna y baja sale de la universidad por la v a de subida que solo es de subida es decir la polic a no saca al presidente por la v a normal de salida sino que lo saca en medio de todo el bullicio y de todo lo que pasaba entonces el presidente sale como corriendo de la universidad cat lica y est n en las fotos y los videos diciendo que hay una manta blindada esa manta que cubre a veces que yo dec a el d a que me la tiren encima me mata la manta porque me rompe la columna
8599491 aqu de lo que se trata es de lo siguiente yo soy universitario de toda la vida la izquierda ecuatoriana ha hecho las manifestaciones en contra de los presidentes a donde estos presidentes se encuentren lo que pasa es que ahora como que la tortilla se ha virado debido a que en este caso quienes protestan son del sector de la derecha pol tica ecuatoriana y entonces hay que ponerle nombre y apellido a cada delincuente porque ah hab an montones de personas decenas de decenas de personas seg n los videos entonces escogen nombres bonitos como para carg rselos encima
8599492 yo creo que todo esto desprestigia a nuestro pa s porque no se busca la verdad tenemos que buscar la verdad en cada caso y en cada momento de nuestra vida
8599493 como se ha polarizado tanto la situaci n yo creo que esto va a quedar el fiscal puede levantar juicios etc etc todos hemos sido universitarios todos hemos sido en una u otra forma m s rebeldes y sabemos muy bien que cuando un muchacho de veinte a os le dicen tal cosa contesta con otra igual entonces aqu la universidad cat lica hoy d a leo preocupado que dice que ha habido gente con manopla que ha perseguido etc etc entonces el tema se va agrandando en lugar de buscar la verdad se va buscado culpables en cada grupo
8599494 lo nico que rescato es que los universitarios por fin ahora han dicho aqu estamos porque hace tiempo que estaban dormidos y no hab a una presencia universitaria en el pa s como que estaban yo digo como que si les hubieran puesto una inyecci n de trancalmato
8599495 claro que hay que sancionar cuando hay que sancionar pero en este momento yo he sido presidente de la rep blica y a los dem s presidentes a todos nos han insultado cuando han querido el grupo tal o el grupo tal los que somos m s dem cratas que otros hemos pasado por alto esas situaciones pero aqu querer expulsar alumnos de la universidad a b o c yo creo que esa es la medida m s dr stica porque incluso los pone en peligro de perder sus vidas universitarias en cualquier universidad
8599496 nosotros como mpd estamos en una intensa campa a por el s creemos que el proceso constitucional es la culminaci n de d cadas de lucha del movimiento se est n recogiendo en la nueva constituci n pr cticamente las banderas del movimiento estudiantil de los trabajadores y hoy estamos a punto de tener una constituci n que recupera derechos soberan a y desde ese punto de vista somos parte y protagonistas de ese cambio
8599497 somos optimistas estamos recorriendo el pa s y entendemos que el pueblo ecuatoriano en el ltimo proceso ha ido encontrando un anhelo de cambio que se va clarificando este pueblo es bien especial en esos a os de democracia representativa ning n presidente ha podido repetirse ning n partido ha sido la mayor fuerza pol tica en una elecci n el pueblo siempre ha estado buscando el cambio
8599498 cuando a la gente le decimos que el neoliberalismo durante 30 a os hizo que la educaci n sea excluyente la universidad sea pagada m s de 8 mil escuelas cerradas la gente ve el ayer y ahora le decimos que se va a duplicar el presupuesto de educaci n si le decimos que la universidad va a ser gratuita y que tendr n acceso los hijos del pueblo son razones que la gente entiende directamente
8599499 j venes maestros campesinos trabajadores informales que han sido en el pasado perseguidos son sectores que quieren el cambio tradicionalmente el pueblo ecuatoriano no quiere que regrese el pasado y quiz s esa es la mayor fortaleza del s plantearnos que en la nueva constituci n haya un futuro
8599500 este pa s est polarizado hace rato es uno de los pa ses mas injustos de am rica latina cuando hay una mayor a que est fuera de la riqueza que no tiene acceso a educaci n salud a trabajo y una minor a que vive del trabajo ajeno que se hace millonaria a costa de la riqueza nacional evidentemente hay una polarizaci n ahora lo que ocurre es que esa mayor a est tomando conciencia de cambiar las cosas
8599501 estar a preocupado si las c maras estuvieran aplaudiendo la constituci n
8599502 estar a preocupado si el partido de jamil maguad la udc estuviera apoyando la constituci n pero me alegra mucho que estos sectores que han estado acostumbrados a no pagar impuestos a tercerizar a los trabajadores tienen que buscar defender sus privilegios
8599503 ahora se habla no solamente de fortalecer el estado y gobierno muchas de las pol ticas sino que se establece un estamento hay todo un titulo que se llama participaci n social y ciudadana en donde se establece la obligatoriedad a los sectores populares que adem s se garantiza su capacidad de autorganizarse de participar en la planificaci n en el control popular de la constituci n entonces el pueblo va a ser protagonista
8599504 supongo que en los otros pa ses no encontraron el para so de la corrupci n que hay en el ecuador
8599505 no se sabe de qu fecha pero poco a poco seguramente con la complicidad de recibir y exigir chantajes de muchos funcionarios del ecuador resulta que esta empresa tiene ramificaciones muy amplias en el pa s
8599506 por eso es que cuando el presidente les advirti que iban a perder todo es que se dieron cuenta lo que les dijo personalmente tienen que entender que se acab
8599507 el problema estuvo en que el gobierno de sixto dur n ball n cambian las normas de la contrataci n p blica y quieren privatizarlo todo y privatizan al sector energ tico y se cambia la ley del sector el ctrico y se permite hacer concesiones y este es uno de esos contratos en el que se da una concesi n a esta empresa
8599508 firm un contrato el stico que lo fueron estirando sin que se llegara a romper
8599509 ese el stico fue creciendo y en la poca de lucio guti rrez estaba m s flexo que nunca y entonces ese contrato tiene 10 adedums agregados para cambiar varias cosas y recibir hasta llegado el caso a 100 millones de d lares m s
8599510 estas cosas no se ponen con escritura p blica sino que no aparecen los documentos
8599511 no tiene que preocuparse si la obra la hacen bien o mal
8599512 ahora cuando se suspendi el servicio se evacuaron las aguas se pudo hacer una inspecci n en los t neles y se descubri que no estaba todo cubierto de hormig n ahora lo est n recubriendo
8599513 tienen que pagar un lucro cesantes que est fijado en 200 mil d lares diarios desde el d a que se da 6 de junio hasta el d a que entreguen la planta reparada que ellos de acuerdo a un cronograma han establecido que ser hasta el 4 de octubre
8599514 pero adem s del precio que ellos dieron dijeron que tienen que hacer un reajuste de precios por los dos a os y cobraron 17 millones de d lares por reajuste de precio
8599515 odebrecht se queda con el 20 de las acciones adem s financi el estado ecuatoriano ellos solo construyeron y por iniciativa de todo este proceso se quedan con el 20 de las acciones despu s se las venden al estado ecuatoriano y lo m s sarc stico es que la obra se contrata en d lares ellos que su financiamiento es en reales brasileros entonces tienen que cobrar un diferencial bancario por cambio monetario de reales a d lares nosotros tenemos que pagar las variaciones de ese diferencial cambiario y son casi unos 20 millones
8599516 estamos esperando discutir y negociar pero ya cuando se dieron cuenta de que la cosa estaba e serio sobre todo a ra z de una reuni n que hubo en la presidencia de la rep blica la cual dio cuanta el presidente
8599517 det er helt i orden og vi kan ogs godt bruge den i vores stue men kan du s ikke lige sy et betr k til den for en pink sofa i vores tue nej tak
8599518 although we are technically the newest university in britain at the current time we have a heritage spanning almost 150 years through our founder institutions
8599519 teknologi itu lompatan besar awal abad ini ibaratnya dengan nanoteknologi yakni menghaluskan partikel hingga berukuran nano kita bisa berbuat apa saja bahkan dunia baru bisa kita buat
8599520 negara yang menguasai nanoteknologi diyakini dapat memenangi persaingan global pada masa mendatang karena itu semua negara berlomba menanamkan investasi di bidang ini belum terlambat kita terjun dalam teknologi ini karena perkembangannya baru dimulai pada tahun 1998 masih banyak peluang yang bisa ditemukan
8599521 padahal saya tak ingin bekerja sambilan saya ingin fokus pada penelitian tetapi juga tak mau konyol
8599522 saya hitung sebagai peneliti nanoteknologi di indonesia kemungkinan baru bisa eksis pada tahun kelima jika dalam satu tahun butuh rp 24 juta uang tambahan untuk keluarga dalam lima tahun perlu rp 120 juta saya harus bekerja di jepang minimal tiga tahun
8599523 saya tak dapat royalti dari paten karena waktu itu tak mampu membayar biaya pengurusannya paten ini dimiliki pemerintah jepang dan industri yang mensponsori namun nama saya dicantumkan sebagai penemu
8599524 saya masih orang jawa orang indonesia jadi harus pulang ketika masih di jepang kalau mengingat kondisi indonesia saya menangis di mana mana diremehkan saya ingin melakukan yang terbaik di kampung halaman
8599525 pertama saya kembali dari jepang hanya punya meja dan kursi tak ada satu alat pun untuk mendukung penelitian nanoteknologi juga belum ada laboratorium dan peneliti lain yang mendalami nano
8599526 kita belum punya alat untuk mengarakterisasi partikel nano selain belajar agus juga mendapat tugas mengarakterisasi material yang telah kami hancurkan hingga skala nano di laboratorium di kagoshima
8599527 kita harus mengenalkan nanoteknologi kepada anak anak sejak dini alat peraga nano edu sudah dibeli jepang untuk menunjang pendidikan di sana tetapi di indonesia belum dipakai
8599528 tror du at det er fordi at mine klummer er for provokerende
8599529 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations
8599530 if ireland proceeds down the road of seeking opt outs from the lisbon treaty on issues like defence and the charter of fundamental rights which provoked such controversy during the referendum campaign the approval of all 26 eu partners would be required
8599531 people say we want to play a peter de villiers style of rugby what the devil is that let me explain it to you
8599532 there was a time when we were isolated due to apartheid but when we came back what we didnt do was look at where we were strong instead we copied the model of the australians and became more structured we thought that was the only model available
8599533 we just need to add a component to our game we need players making decisions and playing the situation
8599534 its been very difficult to implement this way of thinking
8599535 but whatever decision they make i will support the players even though i wont always agree with that decision
8599536 giordano bellincampi f r dansk musiker forbunds h derspris for sin flotte musikkarriere og siden hen som succesrig dirigent og operachef

8599539 i wonder if one s love for radio will juice up this player
8599540 we had to do it for the fans because i think everyone is agreed that the fulham game was not the way we usually play
8599541 sometimes you cant play your game but its the way you behave on the pitch and the fans have always been there for us since the first day i came to arsenal
8599542 the defeat at fulham was a really big blow and we felt sorry about it but now it has passed and we have to do the right things for the fans
8599543 the main objective now is to win something this year
8599544 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal we have to win things i hope this year will be a good one but once again i am sure we can do it
8599545 saturday was a big disappointment and we have to remember what happened but we have to keep that behind and look forward
8599546 for a club like arsenal we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit so thats what we tried to do and we showed with the players we have got if everyone is playing the same way we can have a great result
8599547 i think last night he showed against twente that he is a great player
8599548 everyone has a bad time last year against birmingham i had a big mistake that was my thing of course william is a big player a more experienced player and he is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8599549 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes i made a mistake like i told you and i think william is a great player and he scored again against twente everyone is behind him and it will remain like this
8599550 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted from your club your manager your team mates and the fans ade is a big big player and last year he showed he has the quality to be one of the best in europe so we just have to be behind him
8599551 i was delighted to get my first goal for coventry
8599552 it has been a long time coming because i have had a lot of chances since i have been at the club but hopefully that will be the first of many
8599553 i havent played against many premier league sides you always want to prove that you can play against the best teams and best players and i would have liked michael owen to have started
8599554 but we gave a good account of ourselves and showed a lot of character to come back from two goals down
8599555 weve had a bid for alan lee accepted and hopefully we can tie up a deal and get him on board
8599556 we are a bit apart with regards to personal terms he is having a medical and we are still hoping to agree a deal
8599557 im fine now in terms of the knee ive done all my rehab on it though i keep doing exercises on the knee in the morning before training
8599558 i missed the majority of pre season which was difficult
8599559 ive played a couple of first team games and a reserve team match so im slowly getting there but obviously the more matches i play the fitter im going to get
8599560 it bayern versus liverpool in 2001 didnt feel like a big game to me at the time the stadium was half empty and i remember there was a strange atmosphere
8599561 akos is back training and thats a massive boost for everyone
8599562 were mindful that hes not had a full pre season and as a result hes doing some extra fitness sessions
8599563 all things being equal though he should be in contention to make the squad for our home fixture against southampton in mid september
8599564 rowans doing really well hes really stepped up his fitness levels in recent weeks hes already joining in with the first team warm up sessions and it shouldnt be too long before hes involved in the technical sessions too
8599565 its a different injury to the one that kept him sidelined last season but once again well have to treat it carefully
8599566 stoke are interested yes they want to sign him before next monday thats the plan
8599567 it would be a loan with an option for a transfer next summer i think there are good chances this deal will happen

8599914 jeder spieler darf fehler machen wichtig ist aber dass es uns gelingt diese im spielverlauf wieder zu korrigieren
8599915 bei mir muss sich niemand gedanken machen dass ich abhebe ich bin auch keiner der keine kritik mehr annimmt im gegenteil ich will und muss mich st ndig verbessern
8599916 when we took delivery of the seven seas we were confident of the exceptional capabilities she would deliver to our clients and we are delighted to see her complete her first installation project we now look forward to the seven seas demonstrating her deepwater capability in the campos basin brazil
8599917 we are changing the way ocean science is done launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans
8599918 robot mappers are helping design the new and transformational infrastructure to accomplish that change that new infrastructure will empower the next generation of robots to go far beyond the current autonomous mappers
8599919 this investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state of the art science support
8599920 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
8599921 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter our engineering team and our vehicle all performed very well under the stresses of putting a complex system into the ocean for the first time
8599922 sentry has given us a survey with great precision and resolution
8599923 these maps will help with the installation of the primary nodes of the networked observatory on the juan de fuca tectonic plate
8599924 we chose the body shape the tilting foils and the location of the thrusters to give sentry a favorable combination of maneuverability over a wide range of speed as well as hydrodynamic efficiency
8599925 sentry is a true robot functioning on its own in the deep water
8599926 the vehicle is completely on its own from the time it is unplugged on the deck and cut loose in the water we can send a few simple commands but there is no room to micromanage
8599927 were grateful to the scientists of the university of washington for believing in sentry enough to schedule it for this early mapping phase of their project
8599928 technological progress relies on scientific users willing to accept some risk in return for the benefits of our new systems our colleagues at uw played this role in the past with our first jason remotely operated vehicle and with abe so it was fitting that we made the first science cruise for sentry with them
8599929 sentrys niche will be the ability to run many types of dives from long missions high in the water column to detect hydrothermal vent plumes to bathymetric mapping dives closer to the seafloor to close up bottom photography in rugged terrain
8599930 sentry can be outfitted with a variety of instruments and without those instruments being tightly integrated into the vehicle
8599931 these defects grow in the dark and die in the light of exposure
8599932 the server market has experienced acceleration in revenue growth over the past four quarters diversity in market demand demonstrates customers do not believe a single standardised infrastructure is capable of meeting all their computing needs
8599933 at the same time the pricing challenges many oems experienced particularly in the x86 server market is a concern as it may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand as enterprise budgets face further scrutiny in the second half of 2008
8599934 ibm regained the top spot in unix market share on the strength of its power based system p and merged power systems families growing revenue nearly 25 7 per cent in the quarter and gaining 5 1 per cent points in year over year comparisons
8599935 sun took second position with 31 1 per cent share posting a drop of 5 6 per cent points from a year ago and hp rounds out the top three with 25 8 per cent share and a gain of 1 per cent point overall the unix market remains a significant source of revenue and competition among the top three suppliers
8599936 while all the major vendors exhibited strong unit growth there was significant price competition throughout the quarter
8599937 low end volume servers such as 1 and 2 socket systems are somewhat viewed as commodities and experienced the most pricing pressure additionally the quarter was made noteworthy by the fact that several of the tier one vendors began shipping their new systems targeting large scale datacenters typically these are stripped down servers that are designed to operate at maximum power efficiency all components and features that are not essential including server redundancy are eliminated to reduce the capital expenditure of these datacenter customers

8599940 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged
8599941 two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8599942 two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8599943 as soon as the house is deemed to be safe a search will be carried out to establish if anybody was inside
8599944 forensic investigators have been at the scene and house to house inquiries carried out
8599945 even though abortion is considered a crime the fact of the matter is about 2 million indonesian women abort their babies every year and most of them do so unsafely or have had them done by unqualified medics or in dire circumstances
8599946 take article 15 1 for instance the law states that in the event of emergency certain medical measures may be performed to save the mother and baby
8599947 the provision that is meant here is one that regulates abortion and seeks to prevent widespread unsafe methods instead of prohibiting it altogether
8599948 to fulfil womens reproductive rights the government is obliged to provide safe abortion facilities and services that women who need it can afford
8599949 the downgrade reflects teekays weakened financial risk profile from the companys aggressive use of debt to finance its acquisitions and expand its fleet as well as its exposure to the volatile spot tanker industry
8599950 partially mitigating these risks are teekays market leading and defendable position in the shuttle tanker business increasing revenue contribution from more stable liquefied gas and offshore segments a strong customer base and a young fleet
8599951 teekay has delayed its debt reduction and because of debt financed acquisitions and new vessel purchases its financial measures deteriorated the company intends to resume reducing debt with its cash flow generation in addition to issuing equity at its subsidiaries and disposing of some of its vessels however its ability to do so depends on investor appetite and conditions in the equity and vessel markets both of which are largely beyond the companys control the current financial measures are weak for the revised rating level reflecting our expectation of continued debt reduction within the companys internal gearing targets for each of its businesses in the coming year
8599952 should be defendable given its capital intensity protection from long term contracts strong track record and customer relationships the companys market position is supported by an extensive and young 163 vessel fleet teekays exposure to the volatile spot market should decrease over time as a large proportion of the recently acquired vessels and newbuildings operate under fixed rate long term contracts
8599953 the stable outlook reflects teekays strengthened product offering and market positions
8599954 however its current financial risk profile is weak for the rating and its crucial the company improve it in the near term the outlook also reflects our expectation that teekays adjusted debt to ebitda will fall below 6x and adjusted funds from operations ffo to debt will reach 20 in the next 12 months through the companys deleveraging efforts we could revise the rating or outlook on the company downward if its debt reduction plan falls materially short of our expectations conversely we could revise the rating or outlook upward when the company improves its adjusted debt to ebitda to below 5 0x and adjusted ffo to debt to above 20 while maintaining its strong market positions and reducing its exposure to the spot tanker business
8599955 its hard to say grace and to sit in the place of someone missing from the table

8599970 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
8599971 despite the widespread enthusiasm about the 2008 presidential elections connecticut residents are not optimistic about what it portends for an economic recovery
8599972 i think there are some major innovations that need to occur before we see that happen
8599973 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
8599974 larger babies do better it could have an important implication for babys health

8599978 if someone has made it to the age of 75 and they dont have an elevated psa the likelihood of them developing clinically significant prostate cancer in the last 10 to 15 years of their life is pretty low
8599979 more than in any election i can remember the vice presidential choices made by these candidates stand to make a significant difference especially among undecided voters
8599980 lay things out in a film style a comic book style

8599988 she was out sailing before i do know she knew how to swim she was wearing a life preserver it was just a tragic accident
8599989 we had a great off season this spring and summer
8599990 we had a core group of kids that really dedicated themselves to getting better we still have a long way to go but were headed in the right direction weve been working for 10 years to get our kids training year round and i think were getting to that point in our program
8599991 well be young but have some talent and some motivated kids
8599992 we struggled a bit last year before finishing pretty strong the goals on the horizon are much bigger now
8599993 maybe jim morrison can similarly return to run for president
8599994 we always have more calls and e mails from kids and parents interested in swimming after an olympics
8599995 but theres been a lot more than usual in the past couple of weeks probably because of phelps its the same with the other coaches ive talked to
8599996 its great to see more kids and families getting into the sport how many of them will stay with it is the big question
8599997 the question we always ask beginning swimmers and families is are they ready to make the time commitment
8599998 it doesnt matter if youre with a united states swimming affiliated club like us the dolphins or at one of the area y teams
8599999 you have to be ready to put in the time
