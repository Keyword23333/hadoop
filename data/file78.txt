780145 market economies typically are characterized by extended periods of stability occasionally punctuated by short unstable periods that forever alter the economic landscape in the past disruptive technologies such as the printing press and the steam engine were catalysts in redefining the economies of their respective eras in the information age economy the internet has emerged as the primary disruptive force of our time driving unpredictable changes in our economy while simultaneously challenging the viability of the 20th century enterprise
780146 today we live in an innovation focused knowledge enabled economy where work is increasing rapidly in complexity and velocity computers have migrated from being information crunchers focused on optimizing productivity to people connectors focused on creating economic value through human interaction in this increasingly flat transparent and globally interconnected world organizations or individuals that cannot change as fast as the environment within which they operate are destined to regress to a mean of mediocrity

780168 in the end when the post was on the blog cilantro was unable to cope with the crowd over that weekend
780169 like the foie gras this is a challenge to the hawker generally speaking hawkers are willing to try new things if the response is good after the dish appears on the blog then the new dish will become a regular item likewise if the response is lack lustre then the hawkers can treat it as a new attempt and publicity

780305 gt class of 2008 sits inside the hell at cmac on thursday june 26
780306 the lead classroom will be a place where differentiated instruction will thrive it is designed to specialize in individualized instruction since it will contain students from two grade levels those who demonstrate aptitude and ability in particular areas will have the unique opportunity to gain exposure to content otherwise not possible
780307 it is neither a remedial class nor an accelerated class it is a heterogeneous blend of our student population in a unique and supportive setting
780308 i was the only seventh eighth grade social studies teacher i absolutely loved it it was an opportunity to stretch student minds and social development than is possible in a typical classroom setting
780309 these were really the hardest hit areas leaving a lot of damage behind
780310 with this kind of intense sporadic rain its hard to pinpoint beforehand the places most prone to heavy storms
780311 for most of the towns hit hardest i would estimate that there was about one to one and a half inches of rain within the hour
780312 we have a unique opportunity to enable community renewal to revitalize our downtown area and to extend the now existing commercial growth on the west end of macedon farther east on state route 31 into the village
780313 this application will place us in a position should the village be selected to receive education and guidance using the main street four point approach model of the national trust main street center for commercial revitalization
780314 i have met in person with nearly every village business owner so far
780315 im stretching out into the township i hope to have potentially identified the appropriate candidate to drive the progress if we get the technical assistance we need
780316 the application simply states there needs to be a level of support
780317 that doesnt mean the financial situation cant change it doesnt mean our commitment cant change
780318 that to me is not a surprise answer but that is the common answer i just want to work to ensure that when the time to apply comes in we have that commitment to go forward
780319 i think whats concerning me is the burden will fall completely on taxpayers
780320 in order for this thing to have a chance to survive it needs a commitment of a three year period
780321 we cant just do it for a year it will fall flat on its face
780322 i think that for the benefits derived from this i dont see any problem with the village committing to a portion of it for three years
780323 but there are certain benefits to the businesses in the area and they should step up to the plate
780324 the purpose of the award is to break away for it not to be completely and solely controlled by the board but to be controlled by business owners the citizens

780330 with this being his last season in any sport he really buckled down and trained hard
780331 i knew he wanted to come back strong in the outdoor season and he dropped his time a lot
780332 not many athletes have the chance to go to back to back state championships and i wanted to be one of them
780333 when i started running track i saw it as a way to stay in shape
780334 after my sophomore year i knew that i wanted to focus on track
780335 he was at the peak of his game as a senior
780336 pat really gave us his heart and soul he stepped into a leadership position and knew exactly what we had to do on defense
780337 his size is excellent and he is a very strong goalie he has excellent characteristics of a goalie he is in great shape and he loves to have fun and compete

780348 i didnt want to leave that four footer there i was kind of sweating there but i was glad to see it go in
780349 i have to be comfortable over it and i was not comfortable yesterday and all day today i started out okay but towards the end it got kind of shaky

780431 these findings clearly identify the kinds of hiv prevention that are most needed by african people living in england
780432 having detailed information about which africans need the most support will help the organisations which fund and deliver services to better target their scarce resources
780433 the report re affirms the importance of making hiv testing services treatment and information easily available and accessible
780434 less than one third of people living in low and middle income countries who need life saving hiv treatment have access to it and it makes sense that people will be influenced by their experiences in their countries of origin
780435 the international hiv aids alliances partners in africa have been addressing these challenges for years and have developed innovative programmes to respond to the urgent need for prevention and treatment

780443 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
780444 i came onto the court thinking ok its not going to be an easy match
780445 i would say i was more experienced in finals and it paid off
780446 i hit some good shots and in the crucial moments she gave me some good mistakes that i could say thank you and that helped me win in two sets
780447 normally if i win a tournament the next week id always lose in the first round
780448 when i won my first match i thought ok its better than the previous times then i just took it one match at a time
780449 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished i played better
780450 i wanted to have a good match against dinara in the rallies i didnt play the way i wanted i was scared to make a mistake thats why i was standing behind the baseline it was not all good today but that happens
780451 now i have enough confidence to believe in myself so we will see
780452 this was my best week ever and i really enjoyed it
780453 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
780454 i put in a lot of work off the court to be able to win these sorts of tournaments and it makes it all worthwhile
780455 he was making me have a lot of unforced errors
780456 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm
780457 we had like a 30 shot rally and i was dictating most the point but in those conditions when you played so many long points and youre really going for the shot your legs get really fatigued
780458 ive started to play more consistently in the bigger tournaments
780459 obviously winning your first one makes a big difference in your confidence ive never been past the quarters of a slam before so theres still a long way to go
780460 when they left i felt as if i had lost my arms i was so sad that i lost my appetite
780461 she used to kiss me whenever i learned a new thing at the age of 11 i could do a lot i began doing things like measuring my grandfathers blood pressure and giving my mother her insulin injections

780489 then why do i have this conversation so frequently what do you suggest i say upfront to avoid wasting everyones time
780490 were actually trying to help our customers by giving them bigger savings were doing them a favour
780491 but i dont believe in department store cards i dont want you to have my information and i dont like the massive interest rates
780492 you have to understand that our employees have to ask you even when you tell them not to theres a customer form which queries whether the customer was asked to sign up for a zippy card if they werent the employees hear about it
780493 i feel bad for the employees but why are you asking your customers to do employees a favour shouldnt it be the other way around ive been coming here less frequently just to avoid this conversation i dont want to feel guilty with every shopping experience
780494 we could choose to do another audit at a later date but of course we would give them time to implement the core actions

780496 intentionally split change orders processed in the same day for the same contractor
780497 and im hard pressed to say that what they have done wont be sufficient because i believe what did transpire was they were dependant on the players that were there at the time and how do you protect against a very similar situation recurring i dont know
780498 these people that were on the board were elected and the minute you change the players then i would say all of the effectiveness of the rules changes too

780517 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
780518 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
780519 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends

780536 it doesnt matter anyway because users wont change their behavior
780537 it has a lot of things the school board needs to do differently different than what was done under previous boards
780538 i think its important that we have the list and that we bring it up periodically so we dont lose sight of whats contained in this report
780539 i think we learned in the past we need to have a little more eyes
780540 can we say 100 percent mistakes wont happen we cant
780541 our goal is to take action and this board is going to walk the walk
780542 the offering of letters can have a powerful and positive impact
780543 we want every church home group theological college and school in australia to be involved

780545 so as you see my hands look bald like jeza and baby georgies head
780546 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
780547 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
780548 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
780549 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well

780553 sometimes when a person is gone and you dont see him for awhile you kind of wonder if you remember him right then we come in see his face and say yes thats how we remember him his friends come over all of the time just to hang out were amazed at how often his friends come over
780554 he ran for 950 yards in his junior season and he wasnt even the featured back on our team he wouldve had a monster senior season as the main back in our offense i really thought he couldve played at byu or utah he wouldve been a glue guy someone that wouldve found a home in the program
780555 seth was willing to do whatever it took to win games
780556 they wanted to go out there swim around and tease their friends
780557 halfway out they realized they wouldnt make it there and turned around
780558 i thought it was something that i should do alone
780559 i told sennett that if he didnt want to be there he didnt have to be he told me that if i was going to do it he wanted to be by my side it was unbelievable for a 15 year old to say that he and my son kyle were unbelievable sources of strength to me in the entire ordeal
780560 his skin color was good he looked like he was sleeping
780561 if youre tired of living with this eyesore get involved

780564 if it comes up before the board of supervisors hell have to make his position known
780565 the brennans like to personalize every fight especially when they have a questionable project
780566 we dont support the content found in the mailer and were disappointed that others chose to send it
780567 im currently out of the office i will respond to your query on my return on 5th august
780568 so when is autodesk going to have a 3d piping application
780569 this is something where everybody says yeah i dont want to look at that place anymore
780570 its like having a self appointed warlord in your neighborhood
780571 its essential that we have a full service grocery store in this area land use wise i strongly believe in building housing over retail ive stated that publicly for some time
780572 when i bought my building here 22 years ago there were no kids
780573 now there are 10 kids around me and i love that
780574 its young people with their first kids they both work and they can barely afford the place they bought they see this project as a chance on some level to make it better

780593 us presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
780594 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
780595 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
780596 barring any major and unexpected developments like an israeli air strike on iran and the retaliations that would follow a fair minded person could say with reasonable certainty that the war has ended a new and better nation is growing legs whats left is messy politics that likely will be punctuated by low level violence and the occasional spectacular attack yet the will of the iraqi people has changed and the iraqi military has dramatically improved so those spectacular attacks are diminishing along with the regular violence now its time to rebuild the country and create a pluralistic stable and peaceful iraq that will be long hard work but by my estimation the iraq war is over we won which means the iraqi people won

780604 michael savage is spectacularly uninformed about this major national health crisis

780606 hopefully this tragedy will cause a lot of listeners to realize how dangerous these guys are
780607 condor after tax increases in the clinton years this country enjoyed tremendous prosperity
780608 thats a fact also check out how european stocks have done over the past five years or so much better than american stocks yet europe has a much higher tax rate than the united states it sure doesnt hurt europes economic growth
780609 with bushs deficits were getting deeper and deeper into debt with foreigners like china were also passing on that debt to our children and grandchildren like irresponsible parents who run up their visa card and never pay it down
780610 your economic analysis is deeply flawed tax cuts dont bring in more revenue to government they decrease revenue this is why we have a record breaking deficit this year
780611 heres some advice pay more attention to facts and less to right wing talk radio which is largely fact free

780630 i currently do not have access to the internet and so cannot read or respond to your message
780631 if we do not have all the details we probably should not discuss this issue it is very senstive to the school and community
780632 id be surprised if the school provided the details the only info we get may be from this site
780633 the letter was drafted by lawyers they have the washington post sitting on their board and they have a powerful pr firm calling the shots now you know why this has not been picked up by the press yet it is a sick situation and the information is being held too tightly when did the school suspect who found the pictures why the delay in calling the parents
780634 i heard that all parents in name redacted s class were contacted before the general letter went out
780635 im happy to answer any questions you might have privately
780636 as a group we tend to really emphasize deep multi layered complex storylines and lots of roleplaying but we also enjoy grand melees and sophisticated tactical thinking our players tend to make well built characters but we frown on egregious examples of min maxing using material from a variety of sources that was never intended to interact with one another
780637 i think its unbelievable that this isnt on nbc4 or in the post i guess the fact that the publisher of the washington post and chief executive officer of washington post media is a beauvoir parent and on the beauvoir board makes it not surprising that its not in the post
780638 beauvoir is paying the price for hubris and arrogance of its administrators our cathedral brothers and sisters are getting layed off due to financial mismanagement while the beauvoir head of school makes an annual salary of 330 000
780639 sorry beauvoir you arent getting much sympathy from a family thats had two generations of alums
780640 if you escort someone off school grounds tell him why let him go his own way and dont arrange with the police to give them an opportunity to confront him well then there may be significantly less evidence left to examine
780641 beauvoir sounds as if its ruled by a queen bee whos surrounded by a nest of vipers its truly a dysfunctional place with a damaged brand
780642 the brand may be damaged but beauvoirs damn good at raising and spending money
780643 thank you to everyone involved to make this camp happen for all of these kids we are truly thankful to and for you all my daughter and 2 of her friends came home from high school lift camp today and amen to our glorious father they were brimming with love laughter and a level of emotion that i never saw stir in her before the stories of camp unfolded she couldnt tell me quick enough she wanted it all to come out at once and her need to relay to me the level of worship that you all experienced the pride that you had in them and the support they had for one another i was so thrilled and excited that he touched them as he did i cant say i was surprised because i knew it would be like that we have such an amazing loving god who puts just the right people in just the right places to do his work i pray that i too will be used like that some day

780658 i asked him bhaichung bhutia the other day whether he was really 32 or 28
780659 im really amazed by his involvement here is a player into his thirties still scoring goals in important matches and more importantly chasing the ball and doing right things even in the 92nd minute
780660 i wanted these players fresh for this match thats why i made so many changes against tajikistan the boys showed excellent spirit

780673 they tend to be more larkish as children becoming much more owlish throughout adolescence and at their most owlish in their early twenties in old age they become more of a lark again so its down to age and habit and to a lesser extent genes
780674 we found that people with a long version of period 3 were much more likely to be morning types and those with the short version were likely to be evening types
780675 its simply that there tended to be more morning people who had the long version

780679 they showed signs of being much more tired and also showed a dramatic fall in cognitive performance
780680 the owl is more adaptable and more able to be a lark larks are more rigid in behaviour
780681 if flowers on your nightstand make you want to sing a song then great but this is more a behavioural phenomenon than a physiological one you might be an owl at 20 but when you have children youll be forced into being a lark basically youve just got to do it

780692 we believe its important to expose our residents to life after the grove living here is pretty sweet with no worries about roommates not paying rent or bills and the luxury of having a full amenity package at their fingertips we dont want them having total culture shock when its time to enter the real world
780693 we know college is stressful so we help balance that stress with a lot of fun we put together themed parties like peace love grove event where students wear tie dyed grove shirts love beads and participate in green days
780694 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights
780695 our events are successful because they are led and organized by our community assistants peers attending the same university when residents feel a part of something they are more likely to stay where they are making our residents better makes the grove a better place
780696 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective

780716 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot

780777 for us it is difficult to understand the objectives of new sanctions
780778 however events since the run off have once again shown that there are no certainties in politics how is this so
780779 what is the purpose of expanding the listing of people and companies sanctioned if the very people that are supposed to enforce the sanctions are supporting those on the list why bother with sanctions mugabe seems to travel all over the world and the only change we have seen lately is that his wife grace will no longer be permitted to travel with him now we discover that the un is in business with solomon mujuru of all people and although they have been made aware of the error of their ways nothing has changed the sanctions are administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the from engaging in any transaction with any person entity or organisation undermining democratic institutions and processes in this also precludes anyone on the designated nationals list or immediate family members of these designated individuals from engaging in these activities prohibited transactions include exports imports trade brokering financing and facilitation as well as most financial transactions including foreign branches or any person in the
780780 and we all know how this is going to end the war veterans demand the cattle and the money eat the meat and spend the money and when theyre ready they will move in and run the farmer off his land end of story all the cattle and money has done has bought the farmer a little more time nothing else we want erasmus to pay us because all along he has been utilising our resources
780781 we seized 14 of his 15 farms and left him with one we feel that he has to pay us for sparing that one
780782 according to the land policy adopted by the mugabe government it is meant to be one man one farm why should they then not leave erasmus with the one farm i would dearly love to know who got the 14 farms they took away from erasmus the landless blacks i dont think so and how many of the recipients of farms from the mugabe regime are actually working the land and how many families have more that one farm in direct contravention of zanu pfs own policy mugabes family has at least three farms statrt at the top and work your way down we met as war veterans and agreed that the 15 head of cattle we had demanded initially were not enough

780788 coal also contains low levels of uranium thorium and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes whose release into the environment leads to radioactive contamination while these substances are present as very small trace impurities enough coal is burned that significant amounts of these substances are released a 1 000 mw coal burning power plant could release as much as 5 2 tons year of uranium containing 74 pounds of uranium 235 and 12 8 tons year of thorium the radioactive emission from this coal power plant is 100 times greater than a comparable nuclear power plant with the same electrical output including processing output the coal power plants radiation output is over 3 times greater
780789 americans cant just adjourn for five weeks from outrageous energy prices
780790 americans cant just adjourn for five weeks from outrageous energy prices so congress should not leave until we get the american people some relief they deserve the only way that the united states will see relief is to increase our energy supply that means drilling in anwr and the ocs while pursuing oil shale and investing in alternative energies that means bringing these solutions to the floor of the house for an honest open debate and a fair vote like americans and bi partisan members of congress have demanded this alone would bring down speculation costs however because of this majoritys leaderships eagerness to get out of dodge it is east texans and the rest of americans who will continue to pay the price we should not adjourn our work here is not done

780797 making federal student aid available to students with intellectual disabilities will provide them the opportunity to access post secondary education programs that improve students academic and personal skills independence and employability

780799 congress has now passed legislation that will help further protect american consumers especially children from dangerous products by increasing enforcement emphasizing research and development and imposing stiffer penalties on offenders
780800 every person and company along the supply chain has a responsibility to ensure the safety of consumer products parents however diligent do not have the facilities to test and analyze the content of the many products which are aimed specifically at children that duty falls to the consumer products safety commission
780801 i believe this measure will go a long way toward strengthening the consumer product safety commission in its mission to prevent dangerous products especially those targeted to children from being offered for sale in the united states

780903 we did the first jump at kirra just to see if he liked it because if he didnt i wouldnt pursue it
780904 i said to myself if he doesnt like it hes not doing it again but he loved it
780905 it was all fine though and when we landed he just got his ball and ran around in circles
780906 he was a normal happy dog and the jump didnt seem to scare him
780907 ive actually spoken to tv vet dr harry cooper many years ago when a team member was jumping with a dog
780908 someone had complained to the rspca about it so we contacted him to do a story on it and he said there was no issue as far as cruelty to animals
780909 we wanted to give them something more than just a tandem dive with two people
780910 that would have just been the same old thing but when you land with a dog well thats certainly something a bit special

780913 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome

780986 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
780987 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
780988 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
780989 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
780990 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this

781006 i probably will be in the olympics i just have so much confidence in her i see how hard she trains and how well she takes care of her body i just feel like she is ready for this situation
781007 i tried the 400 once and couldnt do it after that
781008 i will never do it again thats why i respect her so much for running the 4 i know what it feels like you feel like your heart is going to bust your hamstrings are going to bust out everything its the hardest full speed all the way around
781009 its a nice speed like 26 seconds so thats running
781010 the 100 i got her the 200 um i dont know the 400 she will kill me
781011 it was good to see her get first place and qualify for the olympics
781012 you can fall slip pull up anything sprinter tyson gay pulled up in the 200 and wont have a chance to run anything can happen you can take nothing for granted

781015 there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
781016 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
781017 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
781018 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
781019 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
781020 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
781021 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy

781043 you know when youre in a relationship and you keep focusing on the negative things maybe the past or the problems and you cant push forward you cant make anew
781044 so i was going through that with my lady where i kept focusing on the past and the negative things
781045 but writing that song im sure helped you straighten things out
781046 reading charles darwins the descent of man forces one to face an unpleasant truth that if everything he said in his more famous origin of species is true then it quite logically follows that human beings ought to ensure that the fit breed with abandon and that the unfit are weeded out

781050 i do not get in debates with the pope its not a good idea issues like that are between me and my confessor
781051 i never thought i would hear myself saying this while i am not endorsing senator john mccain the possibility is there that i might
781052 we hope that catholics around the state will recognize the moral and civic duty they have as catholics and citizens to vote and to do so with a properly formed conscience
781053 if we as catholics want to effect change in our society and culture we must vote and encourage our friends and family to do the same
781054 the catholic church certainly understands and also believes in the separation of church and state
781055 but that doesnt mean we believe in the separation of faith and politics
781056 faith is what drives the thinking of catholics of christians in terms of their relationship with god and also in terms of their relationship with their neighbor
781057 because of that our political relationships which are about our relationship with our neighbor are informed by our faith so serious catholics whether politicians or ordinary voters have an obligation actually to make sure that faith informs their political decisions and their actions
781058 we catholics are not one issue voters but neither do we catholics believe that every issue is of the same moral weight or value
781059 all of the many issues and rights about which we are so rightfully concerned are grounded in that fundamental right which our declaration of independence calls unalienable and that is the right to life
781060 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
781061 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
781062 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
781063 is now seen as the reigning dean of the womens movement its sort of moses gets all the way to the mountain and doesnt get to the promised land and i think there would be people really angry about that
781064 the question is going to be raised are you telling me that this person would be a better qualified vice president than hillary clinton
781065 if he picked claire mccaskill or janet napolitano or kathleen sebelius i think it would annoy women
781066 those are women who we spent our lifetime helping run for office
781067 a lot of us are not happy with these women for not supporting hillary because they came to us for help based in large part on their gender
781068 i would be very concerned about his judgment if he offered the position to another woman before offering it to hillary clinton
781069 the women who have been elected to office in this time in history are the beneficiaries of the womens movement
781070 and its disheartening to see those same women turn their backs on another woman who is better qualified and one can only wonder what they are getting out of their decision to turn their back
781071 there are a lot of women apoplectic at the discussion of bob barr and chuck hagel
781072 it seems like the smart choice will be to pick hillary clinton because she adds so much to the ticket but the second choice should be a nominee who supported hillary clinton to try and bring the sides together
781073 those adamant clinton supporters the older and i would say wealthier women and some of the better known feminists from the dark ages i think they will use his vice presidential choice whether a woman or a man as an excuse not to support him
781074 obama campaign is taking important steps to reach out to and welcome and incorporate hillary clinton supporters
781075 im sorry to say this but i do think the democratic divide is sort of significant
781076 it could have an impact its not that you need a lot of them
781077 ford lost because the neoconservatives sat on their hands and didnt turn out to vote the real worry is that clintons supporters are going to sit on their hands the older feminists
781078 there are a lot of women apoplectic at the discussion of bob barr and chuck hagel
781079 have uncovered evidence that british muslims are actively supporting the taliban and al qaida in attacks on coalition forces in southern afghanistan
781080 there are british passport holders who live in britain who are being found in places like kandahar
781081 pressure placed on the supervisor of elections by the herald tribune and others with a stated political agenda
781082 why do you think it is important for young people to register to vote
781083 the future of our country depends upon our young people being involved politically as well informed voters our youth must be prepared to evaluate candidates by the content of their policies not merely the label of their party this is the only way we can be assured that all of our future elected leaders will embody the values that have made this nation great lower taxes limited government strong national defense faith in god and equal opportunities for all

781116 we estimate there will be 1 600 fires requiring the presence of at least one fire engine each we dont have that many fire engines in southern california
781117 people call us fair weathered then tremble at the knees when the earth farts
781118 maybe the quake will shake out all the guys from boston that transplanted here
781119 no place on earth offers greater security to life and greater freedom from natural disasters than southern california
781120 i think internet conversations are just reproducing pulp images of southern california
781121 most people are not here for the thrills or an urban version of magic mountain
781122 there is concern a few minor changes to the building code and then the politicians run away from the issue and the people go to sleep
781123 we face seismic hazards we should be under no illusion that 20 000 dead is not an impossibility
781124 its one of the most frightening apocalyptic things ive ever read
781125 i couldnt get up because the ground had liquefied making the wood floor look like waves it was 4am and i thought i was having a flashback until the noise became deafening and the stench of snapping power lines filled the air then the walls began to crack i thought it was game over left the country some weeks later
781126 our conclusion is that the earthquake we looked at isnt too bad
781127 we can reduce a lot of the losses the question is will we have done enough that our economic system can get back together or will we have a katrina type situation where the economy cant get back because all the people have left

781129 we all lose our courage at times it is something we pray for in the morning that god will give us the strength and courage to do what is right
781130 you walk that hallowed ground alone with your memories but not really alone for if you listen you can hear the clear notes of a distant trumpet the same trumpet you hear walking across the parade ground at west point calling us all of us to a higher standard duty honor country yes but it is also an appeal to our central humanity an appeal for a greater decency an appeal for kindness the discipline of kindness a reminder that therein lies our only chance for a permanent victory
781131 these are random violent acts conducted by these violent terrorists and thats why we are not only continuing to go after those who do these things but the networks that support them
781132 we are beginning operations omens of prosperity in diyala province to begin in early august
781133 our message in conducting that operation is we have secured the key cities of the north and we have seen al qaeda continue to be pushed into the support zones the areas of the desert and we will continue to relentlessly pursue them into those areas
781134 they will be bringing together in early august the elements of four iraq army divisions some additional iraqi national police and they will be linked very closely with police forces in diyala itself
781135 this allows for greater political interaction between the government of iraq and the provinces as they ready for the up coming vote
781136 there are still attacks in mosul but they have been greatly reduced
781137 the combination of the iraqi security plan has significantly reduced the attacks and the flow of insurgents into the city
781138 what needs to happen now is the iraqi government and the provincial governments is continuing to improve the economic conditions of the city
781139 more than 2 100 former insurgents in our area that have turned themselves in and said i dont want to fight anymore im tired of running i want to be part of the political process
781140 more of that will happen as people see the increasing strength of the iraqi government
781141 the temperature the last time i was in baquba was 127 degrees
781142 there will be continued operations as long as the iraqi people are threatened
781143 yes in the garden growth has it seasons first comes spring and summer but then we have fall and winter and then we get spring and summer again and change dont forget change
781144 i mean why isnt the address bar just like other toolbars were in ie6 that we could move around as well

781151 we couldnt have asked for better weather actually we had one day it poured for a few minutes and that was it and the first day it just rained a little bit the clouds are nice a puffy in a blue sky its been a great fair
781152 all the profits for the 4h ers for their programs and projects
781153 i like it i come every year we see the horses first than we do the rides its a tradition
781154 all day shes been talking about coming to the fair she wants to ride the pony see the pigs and cows its a little smaller than the erie county fair and its nicer for the kids
781155 it took a couple months to get used to its really country up here
781156 its like a down scale of connecticut fairs its cool
781157 i have two horses of my own in pendleton lots of paints have blue eyes a lot of the time theyre called glass eyes usually a horse has brown eyes
781158 a lot of them that are good especially the first time shooters
781159 you can explain to them they understand and they do what you tell them they become pretty good shots
781160 its more for my son he likes the rides and games they need more rides for younger kids
781161 i wish they had more arts and crafts at it and the prices were a little lower in the games for my grandson he loves all that stuff
781162 we have ideas for more family activities for the fair if they can bear with us theyre going to see a growing fair in the next couple years
781163 the traffic was a little jammed up for an hour or so and we got that mess taken care of theyve been patient with our new traffic flow it seems to be working there are a few glitches we admit to that but we think we can fix that for next year

781172 spending beyond your limits is dangerous but if you do youve got plenty of company government figures show that many households with total income of 50 000 or less are spending more than they bring in this doesnt make you an automatic candidate for bankruptcy but its definitely a sign you need to make some serious spending cuts

781247 it can be very hard for some parents to part with their children especially a newborn said genevieve thiers founder of sittercity
781248 however it comes down to finding the right match if you find the right sitter or nanny its not as painful we consider ourselves safer than using the girl next door

781410 pfox misuses one of my studies on suicide attempts in gay youth to argue that people should not identify their sexual orientation at young ages our findings do not support the contention that young people choose their identity or the timing of events in identity formation nor is there any evidence that the availability of gsas influences those developmental processes

781413 scott you need help even beyond what exodus can do for you
781414 such were some of you one mans walk out of the gay lifestyle
781415 aids comes from the devil directly from satan he uses homosexuals as pawns and then he kills them
781416 tell me anthony what problem would you have with homosexuality if it were not a sin
781417 if you werent christian would you have left the gay lifetyle
781418 no i would not have left the gay lifestyle behind
781419 read dr judith reismans study linking porno and masturbation addiction to homosexuality it has now spread into the heterosexual male population
781420 but all you have to do is look at all the lonely gay people in gay bars and internet sites to see where most of them really are
781421 for all have come short of the grace of god
781422 times that the locusts have eaten out of our lives
781423 give us scientific data we want to see the facts
781424 im jewish and dont follow your christian scripture so all of the biblical quotes you just gave me dont apply one iota
781425 you now have to contend with ex gays who speak with authority about what they witnessed in the gay lifestyle
781426 it doesnt matter if you sleep with 400 guys once like me
781427 i realized when i began to see 35 of my friends die of aids that i probably made the wrong lifestyle choice
781428 i remember hanging up the phone and kneeling down on the floor and it hit me that i had slept with over 400 people in the 1970s i said god i must be infected so i prayed god if you can give me a negative test result i will kill this homosexual orientation off inside of me
781429 anthony ive been patient with you for long enough if you dont give up the homosexual lifestyle now you will die of aids
781430 god pulled me out of the gay lifestyle before aids hit
781431 i was happy being gay until the voice of god came i was really totally happy i was pretty well adjusted in the lifestyle i had no reason to change
781432 and their are tens of thousands of ex gay testimonies to prove it
781433 before you invest the time money emotional energy and possibly years of your life trying to go from gay to straight ask the ex gay leaders what guarantee they can give you that it will work if they are honest with you the best they will be able to offer you as a degree of heterosexual functionality but the gay never actually goes away then ask yourself what would be the best way to spend your time money and emotional energy rejecting yourself or accepting yourself after 22 years of trying to change including ex gay programs exorcisms and 16 years of marriage i came to the realisation that loving myself was far healthier than hating and rejecting my true self like 1 000s of others today i finally discovered that i can live a wonderfully fulfilling moral life as an openly gay man and still have my faith
781434 scott you need help even beyond what exodus can do for you
781435 im allowed to demonize all gay people and accuse them all of sleeping with 400 men because i did it which means every gay person did it and me im off limits
781436 may i ask if you are you a man or a woman emprroph and what does your screen name mean
781437 may i ask if you are you a man or a woman emprroph and what does your screen name mean

781501 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
781502 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
781503 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
781504 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
781505 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
781506 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
781507 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
781508 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
781509 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
781510 i said sure what can come of such a case
781511 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
781512 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
781513 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
781514 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in renal failure and that we are now seeing three times a week for dialysis
781515 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
781516 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
781517 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
781518 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
781519 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
781520 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
781521 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
781522 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
781523 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
781524 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
781525 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
781526 that facility could have taken care of me any day
781527 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
781528 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
781529 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
781530 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
781531 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
781532 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
781533 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
781534 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
781535 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
781536 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
781537 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
781538 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
781539 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
781540 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
781541 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
781542 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
781543 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
781544 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
781545 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
781546 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
781547 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
781548 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
781549 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
781550 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
781551 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
781552 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you

781558 be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
781559 people of good will disagree about whether america should have gone to war in iraq
781560 iraq was a diversion from the fight against the terrorists who struck us on 9 11
781561 people of good will could disagree with the facts but as clear as they are now the facts are manifest that it was a blunder

781563 if you think its presumptuous for bloggers to offer advice to the obama campaign if you think its counter productive or if you believe that blogger is wrong and the obama campaign has been playing this thing correctly heres a few things you can do skip the post read the post and disagree with the writer or write your own post on dailykos or elsewhere explaining your position

781567 oh qu malo ch vez qu gran demagogo qu obsesi n tiene con los pobres pobres
781568 es que no los deja en paz ni un minuto
781569 venga a hablar de ellos a todas horas venga a decidir por ellos a decir lo que les conviene y lo que no
781570 que no quieren alfabetizarse pues hala que se fastidien todos a la escuela
781571 que no quieren organizar sus comunidades barrios y vecindades hala pues a fastidiarse y a organizar asambleas una tras otra
781572 que no quieren estatalizar sus recursos materiales que prefieren repartirlos entre los expropiadores extranjeros pues nada a fastidiarse a organizarse mejor a no pasar hambre a tener salud a no vender el pa s a en definitiva proclamar buenas leyes
781573 pocos motivos inducen a pensar que exista en todo el mundo una proporci n significativa de las actividades de la prostituci n en las que no se empleen uno o varios de los m todos ilegales enumerados por el protocolo para prevenir y reprimir y sancionar la trata de personas
781574 el consumo de servicios sexuales es un acto especialmente marcado por el g nero es algo que hacen los hombres
781575 por definici n la prostituci n a na en una sola interacci n dos formas de poder social el sexo y el dinero en ambas esferas la sexualidad y la econom a el hombre ostenta sobre la mujer un gran poder de forma sistem tica
781576 la definici n de trata que figura en el protocolo rechaza de manera impl cita los t rminos
781577 el protocolo define la trata desde una perspectiva extremadamente amplia que engloba probablemente todas las manifestaciones actuales de la prostituci n
781578 la trata es ante todo una cuesti n de derechos humanos y no de econom a de mercado
781579 por lo tanto en el presente informe se utilizan con cuidado los conceptos de oferta y demanda referidos a la trata al emplear estos conceptos la relatora especial es consciente de las limitaciones del an lisis econ mico e intentar atribuir al t rmino demanda un significado coherente con la perspectiva de derechos humanos desde la que se aborda la trata
781580 la relatora especial hizo suyas las recomendaciones formuladas por amnist a internacional y la liga contra la esclavitud respecto del proyecto de convenci n de diciembre de 2004 as como las de la coalici n contra la trata de mujeres y el dictamen n 253 2005 de la asamblea parlamentaria del consejo de europa referidas a la necesidad de reforzar el proyecto de convenci n de modo que constituya un marco adecuado y eficaz para la protecci n de los derechos humanos de las v ctimas de la trata y de fortalecer los aspectos de la convenci n relativos a la demanda de la explotaci n sexual
781581 a por demanda debe entenderse la relativa a la explotaci n con independencia de que esa explotaci n adem s constituya trata b por demanda debe entenderse la que propicia la explotaci n no necesariamente la demanda directa de esa explotaci n c no es necesario que la demanda por s sola conduzca a la trata basta con que sea la explotaci n propiciada por la demanda la que conduzca a ella
781582 53 y el informe incide en la demanda de servicios sexuales de la siguiente manera
781583 la demanda de sexo comercial suele adem s basarse en diferencias de poder social relacionadas con la raza la nacionalidad la casta y el color de la piel
781584 algunos usuarios de la prostituci n buscan expresamente mujeres y ni as os de distintas nacionalidades razas o grupos tnicos con el fin de explotar estas diferencias de poder y contribuyen as a una forma de racismo enormemente sexualizada mediante la cual siguen el razonamiento de que la explotaci n sexual no es perjudicial para las mujeres y los ni os de distintas razas nacionalidades o grupos tnicos
781585 como cuesti n normativa es evidente que la responsabilidad de la existencia del mercado de la trata con fines sexuales recae sobre los usuarios los traficantes y las condiciones econ micas sociales jur dicas pol ticas institucionales y culturales que propician la opresi n de mujeres y ni as en todo el mundo atribuir a las propias v ctimas la responsabilidad de ser quienes impulsan el mercado ser a una injusticia muy grave tal afirmaci n equivale a culpar a las v ctimas y constituye una nueva violaci n de sus derechos humanos
781586 en algunos lugares se ha supuesto err neamente que en cierta manera dicha perspectiva la de los derechos humanos no encaja con el uso del derecho penal para castigar a los usuarios de servicios sexuales
781587 la ley de suecia que proh be la adquisici n de servicios sexuales es una manifestaci n especialmente adecuada contra la demanda que propicia la trata ya que no s lo condena oficialmente el uso de personas prostituidas sino que lo hace en un contexto que reconoce expresamente que la industria del sexo comercial tiene una naturaleza muy marcada por las diferencias de g nero como ocurre con todas las normas la ley sueca tienen una funci n normativa
781588 la alternativa a la penalizaci n del empleo de los servicios de personas prostituidas es permitir que esa actividad sea legal o lo siga siendo ese enfoque fomenta la demanda que propicia la trata y por tanto hay que desterrarlo la prostituci n legalizada concede a las nuevas generaciones de hombres y ni os la autorizaci n moral y social para participar con la conciencia limpia en la explotaci n de la prostituci n se dicen si es legal debe ser correcto
781589 se dice a veces que al legalizar la prostituci n se aportar a la industria del sexo una transparencia sana que a su vez propiciar la disminuci n de la corrupci n y los abusos sin embargo como se refleja en las repuestas al cuestionario relativas a los pa ses en los que se ha legalizado la prostituci n hasta la fecha el hecho de haber autorizado los burdeles no ha hecho que este sector se vuelva tan transparente como se esperaba y aunque la prostituci n est registrada y bajo control del gobierno las mujeres viven en condiciones similares a la esclavitud
781590 porque claro l montando la venezuela bolivariana mejorando las condiciones de vida de su pueblo estatalizando el petr leo negando las excursiones norteamericanas a sus barriles y frenando con leyes la invasi n de las corporaciones multinacionales y sus pobres pa ses vecinos qu las multinacionales rastrear n por alrededor buscando carne fresca no pero qu malo ch vez l organiz ndose en venezuela y sin importarle lo que pase en los pa ses vecinos
781591 claro suecia con esto lo que consigue es que la trata se derive a los pa ses vecinos como por ejemplo finlandia
781592 pero qu mala suecia que con una buena ley consigue buenos resultados y no se le ocurre que ahora en todos los pa ses en los que no se adopte esa buena ley seguir n funcionando las cosas mal
781593 por qu entonces solo una peque a parte de la izquierda defiende la causa del vegetarianismo
781594 por qu entonces todav a hay parte de la izquierda que se resiste a la causa
781595 existe una prostituci n voluntaria y una prostituci n forzada
781596 desde el rea federal de la mujer de izquierda unida en coherencia con nuestro programa electoral 2004 consideramos que el cierre de locales y clubes de alterne tiene que tener el objetivo claro de penalizar a todos aquellos empresarios que explotan la pobreza y esclavizan a las mujeres que en su mayor a proceden de situaciones de necesidad m xima la lucha contra la prostituci n debe enfocarse desde el apoyo a las mujeres prostituidas generando todos los cauces legales materiales y humanos para que sean protegidas y apoyadas por las autoridades espa olas y encuentren los cauces para poder salir de estas redes mafiosas sin solicitarles nada a cambio los poderes p blicos deben garantizar una sociedad donde se respeten los derechos humanos de todas las personas y por tanto donde la violencia que hoy se ejerce contra las mujeres desaparezca en todas sus vertientes el gobierno debe facilitar y propiciar el acceso de las mujeres prostituidas a la totalidad de los derechos sociales las instituciones locales auton micas o estatales deben dirigir sus esfuerzos para erradicar la industria que se lucra con la prostituci n ajena y que se basa en la explotaci n humana la pobreza y la marginaci n izquierda unida parte de un principio pol tico claro y es que la regulaci n de la prostituci n no beneficia a las mujeres que la ejercen sino a los proxenetas y prostituidores o clientes la regulaci n facilita y propicia el tr fico de mujeres y ni as con fines de explotaci n sexual s lo con la abolici n de todas las situaciones de desigualdad puede que alg n d a alcancemos una sociedad m s justa
781597 ugt no considera la prostituci n como un trabajo sino como una forma contempor nea de esclavitud de desigualdad y de violencia de g nero que hay que eliminar
781598 la definici n de trata que figura en el protocolo no exige pruebas de que la v ctima haya atravesado o no una frontera la trata es trata incluso cuando sucede en la aldea pueblo o ciudad natal de la v ctima pues por trata de personas se entender la captaci n el transporte el traslado la acogida o la recepci n de personas recurriendo a la amenaza o al uso de la fuerza u otras formas de coacci n al rapto al fraude al enga o al abuso de poder o de una situaci n de vulnerabilidad o a la concesi n o recepci n de pagos o beneficios para obtener el consentimiento de una persona que tenga autoridad sobre otra con fines de explotaci n esa explotaci n incluir como m nimo la explotaci n de la prostituci n ajena u otras formas de explotaci n sexual y el consentimiento dado por la v ctima de la trata de personas a toda forma de explotaci n intencional no se tendr en cuenta cuando se haya recurrido a cualquiera de los medios expuestos anteriormente
781599 sobre la ley sueca que prohibe la compra de servicios sexuales las mejores pr cticas para la prevenci n de la prostituci n y la trata con fines de explotaci n sexual
781600 la ley que proh be la compra de servicios sexuales sigue siendo un obst culo contra el establecimiento de traficantes en suecia est claro que esta ley es disuasoria los traficantes est n eligiendo otros pa ses de destino como dinamarca pa ses bajos alemania o espa a donde su negocio pueda reportar mayores beneficios y no sea estorbado por leyes similares

781651 weve seen a deterioration in human rights because of the olympics
781652 specifically weve seen crackdowns on domestic human rights activists media censorship and increased use of re education through labour as a means to clean up beijing and surrounding areas
781653 outsiders who think that a pollution emergency or a spiralling protest would focus domestic blame on the chinese government are dreaming
781654 i dont think such self censorship would be good and i dont think its possible there will be 22 000 journalists in beijing next week there is no way to shut up a journalistic mob of that size each clambering over the next to get the story china decided to invite the world in to host the olympics in the expectation that it would receive a big boost in global respect and affection it is about to find out what happens when you invite the world in if chinese dont want foreigners viewing their country with a critical eye they should kick the foreigners out but you cant throw an event to win the worlds respect and affection screw up the event and then complain that the world is biased against you

781694 dying and rising messiah appears in some jewish texts but until now everyone thought that was the impact of christianity on judaism
781695 but for the first time we have proof that it was the other way around the concept was there before jesus
781696 this should shake our basic view of christianity what happens in the new testament could have been adopted by jesus and his followers based on an earlier messiah story
781697 it is certainly not perfectly clear that the tablet is talking about a crucified and risen savior figure called simon
781698 witherington also points out that gospel texts are far less reliant on the observed fact of the resurrection there is no angelic command in them like the line in the gabriel stone than on the testimony of eyewitnesses to jesus post resurrection self
781699 but it is similar to to other texts found around the dead sea

781720 with fewer police stations limited gps hours libraries closing rarer bin collections and a host of other cuts we are getting less for our money than ever before
781721 people are facing higher fuel bills more expensive food and much bigger mortgage bills and on top of all that they are being stealth taxed and charged more than ever before this con has got to stop

781738 all this talk about a reform of the state has brought local politics to a place where people dont care anymore a dangerous place because then only the radical and extreme voices remain present

781741 the idea of reusing objects across domain boundaries is absurd not even something as simple as person can be defined the same way in different domains
781742 do you support the conservative governments investment in our police and border guards

781765 i am a 40 something white male living in the midwest i just watched your interview about the pakistani american father in georgia who allegedly killed his daughter out of honor i was impressed by your very clear and concise explanation of the reason this man feels he is not guilty perhaps more important was your explanation of how his thinking in this matter is culturally based and not religious in nature adding even more to your credibility is that you stated in this country this is murder even if it is not considered so in other countries in only a few minutes your information gave me a clearer understanding of islam than i have ever had and actually left me wanting to understand more as in so many instances fear of something is often a result of lacking knowledge i think in the united states that could not be more true as it relates to islam or for that matter some other religions too i thank you for presenting a clearer picture for me and all those watching
781766 i think youve hit the nail on the head with ijtihad every 10th grader should know the cradle of civilization is at the tigris and euphrates rivers the fertile crescent every 10th grader should know that if it wasnt for the libraries in moorish spain the knowledge of the greeks romans egyptians and the other ancients would have been lost forever at the hands of the roman church muslims seem to be in their own dark ages no thought no opinion just submission thats what it was like in medieval europe zillions of serfs were ordered to keep tilling the land pay your taxes and do what youre told the big pay off was in the next life where the first shall be last and the last shall be first today thats called the mushroom theory you know keep em in the dark and feed em bullshit ijtihad youll be saving zillions over the next thousand years from an impotent dreary lifeless existence thanks for your efforts from a member of the planet

781774 i havent seen people beating my door down to architect enterprise rss capability over the last 12 months
781775 is rss anywhere near the top of enterprise collaboration agendas
781776 how many pounds of rss would you like to buy today
781777 slates describes the combined use of effective enterprise search and discovery using links to connect information together into a meaningful information ecosystem using the model of the web providing low barrier social tools for public authorship of enterprise content tags to let users created emergent organizational structure extensions to spontaneously provide intelligent content suggestions similar to amazons recommendation system and signals to let users know when enterprise information they care about has been published or updated such as when a corporate rss feed of interest changes
781778 enterprise spending on web 2 0 technologies will grow strongly over the next five years reaching 4 6 billion globally by 2013 with social networking mashups and rss capturing the greatest share in all the market for enterprise web 2 0 tools will be defined by commoditization eroding prices and subsumption into other enterprise collaboration software over the next five years it will eventually disappear into the fabric of the enterprise despite the major impacts the technology will have on how businesses market their products and optimize their workforces
781779 the key hallmark of web 2 0 is efficiency for end users and the ultimate goal is to use technology like ajax rich internet applications blogs wikis and social networks to foster productive advantageous behavior among employees customers partners and other networks such as social computing the information workplace and collective intelligence
781780 in addition i t departments currently work with a host of legacy applications the new tools in order to compete with these will have to be able to integrate with existing technology at least for the time being in order to be fully effective
781781 across the board web 2 0 tools enter a crowded space full of legacy software and processes that are difficult to displace and with which web 2 0 software must integrate to be fully effective integration with lightweight applications like email and excel as well as heavier applications like web content management suites campaign management software portal software and customer relationship management crm systems must all be addressed over time
781782 presenting a live demo at a conference can either be the stupidest or the boldest thing you can do to show a technology solution
781783 it makes a lot of sense you presented a business process you presented a very clear use case and articulated it very well it is one the best actual use cases of integrating enterprise 2 0 into the business process
781784 all these talks about democratizing the workforce yours is the only example that reflects the real world
781785 this is not the typical rss application that was great i think its stunning how simple things can work so well
781786 this is not an elegant solution but guess what it adds value its simple everyone knows whats going on if my chief architect leaves i can hire someone else who will understand it business isnt at risk
781787 an affair of the flesh is easier to get over because its temporary superficial and fleeting its about a body but an affair of the heart stabs you in the heart because it represents a lingering commitment and an attachment to another human being

781791 the gap between blog hype and reality widened in 2007
781792 after counting 36 companies that started promoting corporate blogs on their web sites in 2006 the number of b2b firms starting up blogs dropped sharply to 19 in 2007
781793 the best way to grow your blog is to leave it
781794 okay so does everyone else do this weird thing too
781795 if tim is very positive about his employer he can easily become an influencer and recommender to those following him
781796 as for the ad it cost a lot of money to operate a server farm the size of lijits and deliver our service to publishers reliably unfortunately we cant provide the service for free the vast majority of our publishers would rather generate revenue through ad placements and pay for services like lijit through that channel rather then directly paying for a service like lijit
781797 when i found out it was there i was not only cool with it but i thought it was a good way to show visitors more useful content not only on my blog but on the sites of those on my blogroll and other areas on the web
781798 if thats the case cam why not just add google ads to your blog
781799 you are a big fan of lijit and love the widget so i think that makes you a bit more forgiving toward them doing something like this
781800 btw i think you misunderstand in my view there is nothing to forgive this potentially helps visitors from search either stay on my site longer or find what theyre looking for elsewhere its win win
781801 okay so does everyone else do this weird thing too
781802 which social media site tool is the best for conversations
781803 in a small local business setting how do you determine the number of influencers required for a campaign

781805 i expended a minuscule amount of effort and found contact information and actual names of people working for this company in a sales and marketing capacity
781806 unless of course you only wanted to create a situation where you could poke fun at a company who was seemingly unwilling to to engage with you
781807 i do not mean to be unkind but it seems like you are subtly dismissing willert for not leaping at a chance to talk with someone of your influence
781808 i googled the company and came up with names i also made a phone call to the main number on the web site and asked for names that type of activity is bare bones research for me as a recruiter selling my self services not sure about anyone else
781809 i think there is some inherent arrogance in your assertions
781810 correct me if im wrong but wouldnt the fact that they linked to your blog when putting out the willert newsletter at least indicate that someone from their marketing team had visited the blog especially as they listed bullet points
781811 the key to being successful on twitter is having a lot of followers
781812 companies and the people that manage the brands need to put some trust back in the hands of their customers and realize that they are smart enough to find see and communicate the benefits of their product service without having the messaging spoon fed to them
781813 when talking with a client about social media i have no problem using words such as followers promote and reach because it is their language and at the end of the day we should use words they understand however to succeed as you rightly point out we need to think words such as connected empowered and share and create stratgegies that achieve the latter first however we have to get hired to do good that often means using words clients relate to
781814 i just want to use xyz to gain new clients or promote my company
781815 like many others im also noticing that the discussions occurring on friendfeed are more more interesting and longer than the equivalent conversations at twitter its often 2 to 1 on the number of comments which means that those friendfeed users are far more engaged than those on twitter
781816 hey talk to me on friendfeed or plurk or whatever

781819 if iran launched its attack from a cargo ship plying the commercial sea lanes off the east coast a scenario that appears to have been tested during the caspian sea tests u s investigators might never determine who was behind the attack because of the limits of nuclear forensic technology it could take months and to disguise their traces the iranians could simply decide to sink the ship that had been used to launch it graham said
781820 democrats in charge of north carolinas senate for over 115 years have left a ticking time bomb for next years legislature they defer cleaning up the states fiscal house and disregard north carolina

781822 when asked about her husband being so far behind on paying his city taxes yvonne johnson who has been a city councilmember since 1993 said
781823 the larger the fraction of justices appointed by republican presidents
781824 the same thing doesnt appear to be true curiously for left leaning judges the authors find that the courts liberal justices are driven to vote more ideologically not when their numbers grow but when they begin to drop the fewer justices there are on the court appointed by democratic presidents in other words meaning the more outnumbered the liberal justices are the more liberal those justices get even when the majority shifts only a small amount from 5 4 liberal to 5 4 conservative liberal justices tend to vote more liberally about 3 percent of the time
781825 lets all be praying for wisdom as we prepare to vote

781829 i was using the incident to make a couple of points unfortunately the questions i posed further up this thread have not yet been answered
781830 i think that is an almost inevitable part of the trajectory

781854 yesterday we confirmed that unicef has concluded that it will not consider partnerships direct or indirect with mr lev leviev or any of his corporate entities and will not accept financial or other support that we know is from him or his corporate entities the concerned parts of the unicef family including our national committees have been advised of this
781855 each time as a sponsor of fundraising activities organized by the french magazine gala in support of unicef
781856 unicef officials visited us in may and saw the terrible impacts on our children of the theft of our farmland for the expansion of zufim settlement by levievs company leader we thank unicef for upholding international law and supporting childrens rights and we call on other organizations to do the same
781857 this is of course not the policy of the campaign
781858 it is offensive and counter to obamas commitment to bring americans together and simply not the kind of campaign we run we sincerely apologize for the behavior of these volunteers
781859 we said ok but that we had to bring my sister with us

781863 i think zak has a real good feel for getting through traffic and getting on linebackers and dbs as a blocker hes unusual that way its kind of a lost art if you will he sees things and reacts to things very very well very quickly hes got such good body control he can avoid and get into little tiny holes and get to a linebacker its hard to find guys who can do that he does that very well mo moran norris is more of a real powerful get on that line and blow them up kind of deal so theyre different kinds of fullbacks but theyre both effective

781886 this world cup was fun and that was precisely the trouble with it who wants fun at the biggest and most important sporting event we have
781887 i bought this program thats supposed to be great for keeping track of things i need you to learn how to use it
781888 even if sir osbert lancaster had not been blessed with a timeless sense of humour he would remain the finest pocket cartoonist this country has ever produced
781889 not only could sir osbert draw properly he had an unerring eye for fashion and architecture that made his small drawings a pleasure even in the inconceivable event that you did not find his caption funny i buy his little collections from second hand book shops on a regular basis they are for me worth any number of written social histories if i want a quick review of say the sixties a sir osbert annual is where i start his drawings alone tell the story and tell it with wit and flair
781890 the great thing about osbert is that although he appealed to the establishment he was in fact deeply subversive his best known character maudy littehampton was in fact far more subversive than she first appeared and the truly amazing thing is that osbert was able to show his work on the front page of beaverbrooks daily express undermining everything that the express stood for in a subtle and quite saucy way
781891 i was at charterhouse where osbert lancaster had been at school and because of him and max beerbohm another
781892 i met him once at an exhibition of his cartoons there which included other drawings by past students including myself he looked vividly like a character from his own cartoon universe with a dandyish suit big watery eyes and a flamboyant moustache he was quite nice to me told me i should draw bigger i followed his advice
781893 ability to accurately depict the minutia of historical details from any era all while injecting immense humour into his work no one could do that now
781894 im stuck on your heart hanging on every word you say
781895 the bbc could attract any of our commercial radio talent should they wish to
781896 for many young presenters its a logical step in the development of their career
781897 commercial stations needs to stop trying to be the bbc ditch the networked shows and become truly local again
781898 young presenters are attracted to the bbc because they know they have the freedom to be creative and take risks
781899 i wanted to work at bbc 6 music but they didnt seem interested simply because i wasnt a household name
781900 i even toyed with the idea of doing television just to enhance my radio career
781901 its easier to break into commercial radio and while there youre groomed into a local figure
781902 i cant imagine many presenters would trade the experience you get at a local commercial station for working at the bbc
781903 at commercial stations new talent is left to develop bad habits which arent picked up on
781904 most people still see commercial stations as more credible edgy and fresh than the bbc real music fans tune into stations like ours
781905 who is going to be the next chairman of ofcom
781906 what was the line cut off their heads and take out their brains something like that it was duly delivered with a great deal of conviction and meaning
781907 i was telling them to beware of zombies while actors simon pegg and nick frost actually had zombies out in the back garden its just before they go out in the garden and start throwing their vinyl collection from the garden shed at the two zombies
781908 i got much more street cred with youngsters out of being in shaun of the dead than anything that ive ever done on sky news
781909 i will be very interested to see how the chinese authorities cope theyve invited the world in and the big question is whether they realise the consequences of that its fine winning an olympic games but you cant then lay down conditions for the rest of the world we are all curious to see how open the invite is
781910 well meet politicians and athletes and hopefully meet road sweepers and stall holders and try to give people a flavour of what the people there think whether they are proud whether they think it will change things
781911 we like to get the mood of people and feel what its like down on the street
781912 i dont think we stand on ceremony and i dont think we are stuffy
781913 im a storyteller thats what news is about i actually dont think the news has changed very much since we had town criers in the main square basically i go out there metaphorically and ring a bell and say hey ive got some really interesting stuff to tell you folks gather round i just see it as delivering a cracking yarn with credibility in a compelling way that people want to listen to theres a lot of machinery and technology that has got in the way and has facilitated it shall we say but in essence thats what it is
781914 everyone who is there will be able to text in lines like hey ive just seen the olympic stadium for the first time or this pollution is so bad i can hardly breathe thats something i can do in two minutes in between doing lives or interviews
781915 theyre fat juicy dumplings that we used to go and eat in the park much simpler than having to eat bears and snakes and lizards and all the other things that you get suckered into to get permission for filming you invariably had to take officials out for large banquets that invariably involved things that looked a little dubious you really didnt want to find out what they were body parts of animals that you wouldnt normally have dreamt of eating
781916 i had the most fantastic driver by the name of mr eb lee i said to eb im afraid we need to go and expose your dog restaurants eb he said oh all right then i know where theres one i got micd up eb and i went into the restaurant and he ordered dog we got the plates of dog in front of us and i whispered into the mic thompson puts on his inspector regan from the sweeney accent alright lads you can come in now and the camera crew came crashing through the door when i looked round the restaurant owner was coming at me with an empty beer bottle and so was his wife meanwhile eb my loyal driver and interpreter was tucking into the dog meat in rather embarrassing fashion it was quite a difficult one to edit that one
781917 we are ciphers we are mediums in the media i certainly dont and never have aspired to the idea of celebrity journalism i hope they trust me to tell them the story but not get in their way in understanding the story
781918 i got to the thailand end and set up a beach head quite literally reporting from the beach in phuket and two other teams landed in sri lanka and indonesia once they were up and running we managed to go live for 18 hours a day without throwing back to the studio which had never been attempted before in any way shape or form
781919 in the areas that counted i thought we did fine if they want to play games you could always remind them about the liberation of kosovo when i dont think they even got off the starting blocks did they
781920 the photographer in front of me got nailed through the back and out through the front the young radio reporter behind me got winged it was pretty touch and go really i did rather a breathless piece of camera and we managed to escape and put it on air
781921 the fact that four out of five germans or brits would vote for barack obama will cut absolutely no ice with the blue collar american voter in the rust belt of the midwest i think it will be a fascinating thing to see whether when it comes to the moment in the polling booth americans can bring themselves to vote for a black guy its a huge question as yet unanswered
781922 read over what you have written and when you come across a passage you think particularly fine strike it out
781923 there are some words that should never ever be written especially by a woman glee giggle hullabaloo are three and theyre all in this piece
781924 this is one of the largest media centres ever built by some distance
781925 we worked very hard to understand the scale of the olympics the numbers are staggering even last week the quantity of people there was absolutely unbelievable there is a real buzz about the place
781926 from the beginning we looked carefully at the centres environment
781927 the chinese are very sensitive to culture that was critical that is why you can see the pagoda shape in the roof
781928 celebrity style treatment reserved for hollywood a listers a working journalists paradise where every need and whim is catered for including masseurs chefs fitness trainers and hair stylists
781929 it is quite spacious and well appointed but i am not sure luxurious is the right word
781930 i think it will be less spacious once it is cluttered up with journalists they have a canteen and that was ok but it wasnt exactly caviar on toast i think if the food is good the journalists there will be grateful because they will be stuck in there for so long its not like you can step out and go to a restaurant instead there is so much security around the perimeter
781931 if you google words such as the dalai lama the oppressed movement falun gong or even the chinese language version of the bbc website you have problems
781932 spoken to a junior minister who claims to be prepared to resign in september in protest against mr browns leadership and believes that nine other government members could follow suit

781934 barack is the chosen one but is he ready to lead
781935 you know a few days ago sen obama said he challenged me to a duel
781936 i m for the light sabers as weapons of choice
781937 my initial break was as a stand up comedian i got through to the final of the bbc comedy awards and a week after the show was televised i got a call from an mtv booker i didnt even have an agent at the time and was doing stand up in bristol and two part time jobs selling double glazing and working in a video shop i thought the call was a wind up i did a show called mtv hot every friday night for about eight months i remember being told during the second week that my show had the highest ratings of the entire channel which meant something like 30 000 people had watched it apparently i had beaten beavis and butthead things seemed to be going well and i did a show called pirate tv for a while over the summer of 1998 then i didnt present another tv show until 2003 i always hated stand up the only thing i ever got out of it was sleepless nights but i couldnt see any other way in every time i got a bit of tv i hoped i could stop doing it i was about to get a job in another video shop but i worked out i could earn as much doing 10 minutes of stand up as i would for a whole day there my agent was pushing me to do as many gigs as possible and i got back on the phones and called anybody who had ever paid me anything to perform before it was the first time i really committed myself to doing stand up i threw myself into it and i started to get noticed a bit more in 2002 i started to do some work for bravo and in 2003 i met alan when we did a few things together for channel 4 when i was offered the friday night project i only had one question who would my co host be when they said it was alan i asked where to sign
781938 theres no doubt that our big break or at least the biggest of the medium sized breaks came with peep show the first series was quite low key and i always thought it deserved a future but it was very much hand to mouth no one ever came to us and said right lets have another three series for the first year after i left university i was telling myself i was going to be a comedian without really knowing how it was done we were doing a show at edinburgh at 11am and there was one day when only two people were in the audience one of whom was a reviewer thats when you think are we making fools of ourselves here our agent soon started to set up meetings and our breaks really came from getting to know the people who worked in the business even though we werent known by the public two years down the line we were making a living from writing comedy for shows like the 11 oclock show the jack docherty show and armstrong and miller while trying to pitch our own things the hardest step is breaking in but there are always people in television going around trying to find new talent they are frightened of missing talent that another network might pick up rob and i got our material in front of them by doing our edinburgh shows every year i would have faced rejection for a lot longer than i did before giving up had i still not got where i am now 10 years on im not entirely sure i would have given up yet
781939 david and i were first on television together on a bbc show called comedy nation we played a couple of advertising executives coming up with a new car ad which was highly derivative from fry and laurie it was produced by phil clarke who later produced the first series of peep show on channel 4 we learnt a lot as comedy writers before peep show came along the first series went out very quietly and we were amazed and delighted to get a second series in 2006 our bbc2 sketch show that mitchell and webb look and peep show went out in the same year we also did the apple ad magicians and a national tour possibly with the apple stuff there was a wee bit of overexposure but it is very difficult to turn any of those things down there are some fairly traditional routes into television unlike david who isnt as hellbent as i am i went to cambridge just to be in the footlights then we did edinburgh and got an agent the most important thing is to practise you have to keep doing it and find ways to get people to see you then youll end up on a list of people who commissioners call up when they are looking for new performers there are so few people who can do it really really well that the commissioners just follow the talent they dont know what the zeitgeist is they just follow the creative people and brilliantly say were looking for the next office when the office was kicked around for years
781940 the first television i did was on the first series of johnny vegass ideal three years ago and i think he was using every comedian in manchester at the time i started doing stand up when i was 17 and then i trained to be an actor at salford university the same course peter kay did as soon as i left uni i was doing stand up full time but my first big success was in 2005 when i was nominated for the perrier award at my first year at edinburgh i had worked hard on the show for a couple of years and all the tv people are on the perrier judging panel so that was probably the catalyst for getting television work making 400 people a night laugh doing stand up is a good living and i wouldnt do just anything to be on television i only want to do stuff i would watch myself and ive been offered things which i decided werent for me like big brothers big mouth when russell brand left i was a guest on 8 out of 10 cats first and had a bit of a to do with piers morgan when dave spikey decided he wanted to leave they asked me to take over as captain for every telly producer who thinks youre brilliant youll find an audience who tells you youre not my dad will tell me when my jokes arent funny and that helps me keep my feet on the ground for the new show tonightly it has been really refreshing to meet people who havent been doing stand up for that long and like me are still excited by the cameras there are a lot of bitter people knocking about
781941 star stories was definitely my big break thats where dolly and i met we started writing together and went to the production company baby cow and they nurtured us the first series came out in september 2006 its a mixed bag of actors doing loose impressions of the stars you might do paris hilton as marilyn monroe the formula is that whoever the episode is about is naive and innocent for example kate moss might just fall on a line of cocaine before star stories i was doing stand up comedy and earning a living from acting in adverts the casting director saw a fringe play i was in and invited me along to the audition id done loads of low budget feature films and pilots and was quite used to them not getting commissioned i assumed the same would happen with star stories
781942 after drama school i was doing bits of theatre and television like midsomer murders
781943 you will have to prise from my chuck heston fingers
781944 another mag that i cant get enough of great for the things that you dont get from the last two not the most lively of sites but you can subscribe online and theres a wicked online radio show great for music of old and new from all over the globe
781945 what weve tried to do since 2004 is understand how the media works so weve tried to give news stories to journalists on a plate journalists have 101 things to do in their day and dont often have time to read long and dry reports from think thanks so we use the freedom of information act and a team of researchers to get fresh figures from government and local councils which we package up into brief media friendly research papers complete with eye catching headline figures to give reporters a ready made top line
781946 you cant be a campaigning pressure group and expect to work office hours
781947 the today programme doesnt decide its agenda until late the night before after they receive the first editions of the newspapers so if you are mentioned in the press youve got to be ready and available for interview that night or for 6am the next morning
781948 journalists are often now so overstretched that a lot of work that used to be carried out in the newsroom is carried out by groups like the tpa
781949 what you see now is journalists who are grateful for news which is almost perfectly packaged to go into the paper with a ready top line in that sense journalism is becoming very passive it is a processor of other peoples information rather than being engaged in actively seeking out and determining what the truth of a situation is in an energetic and inquisitive way
781950 for example by ranking local councils by waste or salaries we encourage local papers to pick the story up this in turn causes a stir locally which gets the locals groups agitated and brings us new members and supporters
781951 a new financial elite are seeking to capture the resources of society to promote their new form of wealth accumulation through financial services the tpa is massively helpful to this the tax system it promotes claiming it has popular support is regressive and will widen the poverty gap because it promotes tax reduction flat tax tax simplification which always allows more scope for tax avoidance for the wealthy and all in the name of ordinary people
781952 there are very few investigative journalists around now and they have very meagre resources
781953 this video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by diageo plc
781954 yeah yeah another brand sets out to kick up a storm of controversy in the name of pr
781955 there has been a little buzz surrounding john edwards and his alleged affair
781956 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumours or salacious speculations
781957 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
781958 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist america
781959 every business is different in the terms of process performance and infrastructure assemblage
781960 any stroll in the himalayas or the andes maybe a dip in the ganges was going to leave the mysticism of the camino way back in the distance as far as i could tell i just wanted to go for a walk the idea of walking for weeks the appealing thing a bit of solitude and you can do that lots of places in the world and not have a pilgrim wake you from a doze in cow field to take a photo of him and his wife there was something we clearly didnt get but one thing was for sure i wasnt going to be doing it again galicia a sparsely populated state of spain in the far northwest had the lowest figures for tourism in the country that gets more tourists than anywhere else in europe so the lack of facilities should hardly have been surprising we could stay however in municipal albergues brand spanking new for 3 with disposable sheets and pillow cases expansive ktichens though no one in charge realised that kitchens really need saucepans fry pans cutlery and plates and maybe a nearby tienda that sold food but that of course was part of the charm maybe all the charm we walked into santiago seven hundred and seventy seven kilometres later 34 days did i feel good yes different fitter worth it if you have nothing better to do it was a hike for us and an achievement for sure

781963 when after 23 years of barren marriage the neurotic distrustful king louis xiii of france sired a son in 1638 and thus ensured the succession of his dynasty he made probably his sole contribution to one of the most momentous periods in his countrys history otherwise he was a cipher ignorant dull witted absorbed in his simple passions for hunting horses dogs and any handsome young courtier who was not too scrupulous about how he acquired the royal favor fortunately frances destiny did not depend on a monarch who spent his days hunting wild boar or watching harnessed dogs haul toy cannons across the palace courtyard

781970 madrid has impoverished its squad the shining brilliance of the galacticos has gone but that is not the worst thing the worst thing is that the galaxy has been killed off because of the indecisions and brutishness of capello who hasnt lived up to expectations in any respect
781971 austin is where everyone wants to be we see values going up here
781972 included above i think its to do with the way that the woman is looking off into the distance while the man stares at the camera its also the way hes gripping her as if hes trying to stop her from floating away

781974 i appreciate the fifa presidents words about what we have achieved in the 17 years of my presidency but i cannot appreciate it when the fifa president interferes in an election process here in uefa

782019 june 2008 was the 148th consecutive month when ohios job growth was below the national average
782020 i have informed court chambers and am in the process of informing the ohio attorney generals and us attorneys offices in columbus for the purpose among other things of seeking protection for mr
782021 because of the serious engagement in this matter that began in 2000 of the ohio statehouse press corps 60 minutes the new york times wall street journal c span and jim vandehei and the publics right to know of gross attempts to subvert the rule of law i am forwarding this information to them as well
782022 im not gt trying to screw things up i want to help not hinder
782023 if this is true about connells wife we want to do everything to make sure every witness will be protected against any such threat
782024 intimidating a witness in a federal case is a serious crime
782025 all these local safeguards ensure that local concerns about access to polling stations are handled locally and that both parties have a say in the final decisions
782026 if anyone is running late and he thinks we need to get the show on the road
782027 health care almost forced me out of the senate race
782028 our family was on my wifes health care plan but she cut her hours from full to part time to take care of our children theyre still small while im campaigning next january her insurance runs out
782029 i will absolutely sign that bill but realistically it is very hard to make a wholesale leap to single payer
782030 for that reason i also support senator wydens bill the health care for americans act which creates comprehensive portable health care it eliminates preconditions so people can access treatment for health challenges
782031 unfortunately it the wyden bill doesnt really address the issue of cost
782032 and it should include a provision allowing people to choose medicare let people vote with their feet
782033 i have dealt with lobbyists on almost every issue i addressed in oregon
782034 before diving into health care i focused mostly on international relations and nuclear issues i lived in ghana mexico and india i was an exchange student in ghana when i was 16 it really changed my perspective to live with a family whose primary possession was a bicycle i worked for two summers with the quakers in mexico in a village building and operating an environmental camp my advice to you is dont try to build buildings and work with children at the same time
782035 i spent two years working at the pentagon this administration is a complete disaster you should be slow to go to war and fast to take care of vets this administration is the opposite in oregon we mandated that if you happen to die in the line of duty your family members will receive four years of in state tuition
782036 we need multiple screenings for ptsd for our vets we have to increase the amount spent on mental and general health care for vets mental health is swept under rug we have to make multiple opportunities available to vets to have their mental health issues addressed it takes time for issues to surface you dont just come home and have symptoms show up that afternoon
782037 in oregon we passed mental health parity at the state level
782038 we passed mental health parity mandating coverage by insurance companies
782039 my wife mary worked as a nurse at a homeless shelter in dc most of the people there were addicted to drugs or alcohol or were mentally ill it was very hard to get them substance abuse or mental health treatment we rented out our house in dc to a program for mentally ill homeless people
782040 it was a farm bill but we were able to easily pass it by making it about the kids how can you be against feeding vegetables to children
782041 select group of key players in state government have used the same network of connections they established in their official positions to make money for themselves and raise loads of cash for their party and president bush
782042 a fan came on to make an aggression to frank frank said the guy was going crazy i think the security people were not expecting that he tried to hit lamps and after that people catch him everyone has to do his job security has to do theirs maybe they relaxed with the final whistle they thought the situation was over and slept a little bit and it was enough for a fast guy to sprint in lampards direction
782043 we have three days to evaluate uefas ruling but i can tell you that we will appeal
782044 und jean luc wenn es leben gibt gibt es auch ein ende und das kann mit hohen bestattungskosten verbunden sein auch wenn manche antvilleaner das schon beim rausschmiss dieses typen bei antville nicht kapiert haben

782047 were looking forward to bringing new and very exciting mcp products to the market for both amd and intel platforms
782048 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
782049 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth
782050 the project explores the aesthetic thermal and structural qualities of ultra high strength concrete hsc and the architectural impact of working with elements with a relatively large scale spongy texture it is the extensive research shown in the presentation the search for an integrated or combined quality of building technology physics and architecture that appeals to the jury although the apparition of the chosen texture is not new a o koolhaas has worked with similar elements this project is more than just a pretty element because of the research in the field of energy saving solutions and integrated design a brave experiment with some rough edges
782051 im as shocked as anyone it was a diet pill weve all taken stuff and nothing ever happens we do that at our house if ive got a head cold i might grab one of her pills it was just a bonehead mistake on my part
782052 its the league rule and i have to abide by it i just hope people dont think im out smoking marijuana
782053 we had doubts after he signed such an important contract with the los angeles galaxy that he could play and train with the same desire this week he has taken part in training perfectly he has always had the support of his team mates the only doubts we had were about his desire he has behaved like a great professional and he returns to the squad
782054 this is a very important step for arsenal as this becomes our first venture into the marketplace
782055 cest david cest sur que cest lui il est trop bizarre
782056 can anybody disagree with me if i say that if that happened at the other end of the pitch and its 1 1 the referee is going to give a penalty
782057 its frustrating to say the least but what is the point talking about it i will get another fine
782058 a remedy that makes clubs feel responsible for fans and radically changes the situation
782059 a strong signal was needed until we find measures to prevent certain episodes
782060 we will immediately set up a commission to discuss the situation between sport and politics its not possible to carry on like this
782061 terry returns this weekend hes an important player and weve missed him because hes been out for a long long time
782062 its important hes back especially in a period when we keep losing players its important that when you lose some you get some back
782063 plenty of managers have won the champions league who will not be considered great managers
782064 if you would like to compare every manager you give each one the same amount of resources and say you have that for five years after five years you see who has done the most
782065 people say never judge a manager or a team on a cup run because it depends who you play but in this cup competition we have played everton liverpool and tottenham so it would be a great reward for us to win it
782066 momma i dont think id like to have that surgery because i
782067 you need to get tested for lyme disease i think you have lyme disease also tell them to test you for mononucleosis
782068 hey you were right turns out i have lyme disease and while i dont have mono now my blood work shows markers that i did have it within the last month
782069 yeah its just a hobby dont want to make the other guys look too bad
782070 hey smirky smile i think you guys are blocking the steps
782071 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
782072 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
782073 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
782074 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
782075 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
782076 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
782077 students bring 1 3 billion to the annual economy and yet they can be the victims of poor housing health and sanitation fire risk
782078 this situation can then spill over into the local community and impact on local residents

782083 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
782084 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward
782085 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have a high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth
782086 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
782087 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

782091 formula one and the environment may not seem exactly bedfellows there will always be that last few percent of cynics but we found very strong support right across the world to do something in this direction

782120 the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it
782121 you know everybody gets that whos from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about we understand where thats coming from that gets across
782122 well first its entertainment set up by people who are high minded enough so the film wont be racist or offensive second the whole film is based on the idea that what our characters do on some level is offensive and who we are on some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it thats the truth is entertaining how far reaching can someones narcissism go
782123 you check your gut and ask you know do i feel like the universe is going to support this
782124 we were in rehearsal and i said if kirk lazarus has himself unde the imropession that hes black but hes coming up against an emotional interface with a black man whats entertaining about this just about nothing so i said the only thing he knows about black culture as an australian is what everybody who doesnt know anything about black culture but has put themselves under the impression that they know is that he knows some stuff from some shows from the 70s
782125 im not a political person by design but where were at as a country which is often where things are on a global scale were on a precipice where there can be a lot of healing and advancement or things can out of fear or design or negligence things can kind of go in a lousy way or stay stuck and thats kind of on the menu for the next few months

782129 the only school that made it hard for me was illinois
782130 i talked to illinois coach ron zook on the phone and they recruited me the second hardest and thats what i really looked at in the beginning who was recruiting me the hardest i was going to look at them the hardest iowa and illinois were both up there because they recruited me the hardest
782131 iowa sent me personal letters every day theyve been sending me a whole bunch of stuff theyve invited me to a bunch of stuff ive been to iowa over a dozen times probably
782132 theyve told me where ill be and i feel like ill fit into that program ill play their x receiver thats usually the guy thats the playmaker on single receiver sides and theyll let me make plays
782133 hes got good size good hands and hes the kind of guy that iowa definitely needs on offense because it looked like they were lacking running backs and wide receivers last year hes similar to adrian arrington almost identical to me not elite speed guys but real good hands and good athletes
782134 because its possible you may want to attend all sessions waterfall 2006 features no concurrent sessions all sessions are run sequentially for your enjoyment however since in a waterfall process we dont want testers to know anything about coding or programmers to know anything about design and so on you can only attend sessions that match your job function when you youll be asked to select an appropriate job function when sessions that are not relevant to you are running you will be required to sit idle in the lobby the conference will also feature a number of workshops unlike typical conferences where workshops involve participants talking with each other all waterfall 2006 workshops will be conducted by document come to a workshop open up your favorite word processor and state your opinion on something email it to other workshop participants well set up mailing list aliases for this after all we want to keep this process efficient then just sit back and wait for someone to reply with their own document dont miss this opportunity to participate in vigorous written discussion with your peers

782221 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
782222 i was concerned at the 3 8ths pole and it looked like we were beat turning for home
782223 but he got down on his belly and he won though
782224 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out
782225 i knew he was going to get there at the top of the stretch that horse coal play took off but big brown took off after him he just kept coming and i knew wed get him
782226 today he showed hes a warrior hes always won his other races with such ease today he showed what courage he had
782227 i thought we were in trouble at the quarter pole
782228 nick zitos horse ran so big he kicked away from us and i thought we were in trouble this was another dimension for big brown he showed his heart and courage
782229 if it was up to me i wouldnt run back so quick it may not be in his best interests
782230 i thought we had a helluva shot turning for home
782231 i thought to myself we could do this again im very happy right now we made him big brown run thats for sure
782232 my horse ran an awesome race i felt very confident in this horse heading into the race
782233 he ran great i cant complain its just very rough when things go right for you and you dont get the win

782247 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
782248 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
782249 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
782250 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
782251 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
782252 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
782253 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
782254 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny

782260 not the end of the world if a child has an accident
782261 playing is an essential part of growing up and adventurous play that both challenges and excites children helps instill critical life skills
782262 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
782263 children are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children
782264 they are not enjoying the opportunities to play outside that most people would have thought of as normal when they were growing up
782265 that is very difficult for parents to manage because of the time pressures on normal family life
782266 if you dont want your children to play out alone and you have not got the time to take them out then they will spend more time on the computer

782269 one of the highlights of the sometimes dull annual foreign ministerial meetings
782270 it was the decision of the host not to keep the tradition but i agree it was one of the highlights
782271 the point was to relax and bond mr surin said
782272 i think some of the dialogue partners took their performances too seriously to the point where they felt uncomfortable they kept their scripts secret and rehearsed sometimes in their bathrooms
782273 i for one do not consider his criticism to be foreign interference how could it be foreign interference when the singapore government routinely cite this and that award given by international bodies was it foreign inteference only when criticism instead of praise was offered

782282 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
782283 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
782284 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
782285 the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
782286 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic

782305 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
782306 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting

782317 desafortunadamente una gran mayor a de organizaciones obtienen una muy baja calificaci n en lo que concierne a la utilizaci n efectiva de los gerentes de l nea al implementarprogramas de compensaci n
782318 el asunto es tratar de identificar por qu una empresa surge m s que otra

782338 you definitely get the feeling now when youre talking to people in the area and councils that there is much more awareness about the need for projects like this
782339 i think its much more in the public consciousness now than it was a few years ago

782364 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
782365 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
782366 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
782367 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
782368 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
782369 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
782370 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

782374 websites van bedrijven zijn nu hele bergen tekst de overgang naar veel meer beeld komt eraan
782375 voor bedrijven op een specifieke zakelijke hoogtechnologische markt zoals asml is de eigen productie van video voor een relatief beperkte doelgroep van groot belang hier zie je dat de onderneming haar eigen zender wordt we verwachten dat bedrijven meer en meer daartoe overgaan nu nog is tekst zeer dominant op corporate websites
782376 tv spots zijn gericht op het overdragen van emoties in 30 seconden met een lekkere geile gimmick dat is verschrikkelijk duur in vergelijking tot het effect voor massaproducten wellicht rendabel maar voor de meeste bedrijven en organisaties niet die zijn beter af met een productie van langere duur tegen lagere kosten waarin ze echt kunnen overbrengen wat hen bezielt
782377 youtube natuurlijk maar er zijn inmiddels zo ontzettend veel online videokanalen waarmee je een groot bereik opbouwt dat is het probleem niet
782378 daar maken we geen geheim van dit is corporate communicatie en geen journalistiek bedrijven houden de regie en huren ons in om de boodschap zo aantrekkelijk mogelijk te brengen
782379 toch is dit geen journalistiek of een poging om journalistiek te vervangen dat kun je niet en moet je niet willen wel kunnen organisaties wat ze te vertellen hebben beter over het voetlicht krijgen waardoor ze journalisten in de goede richting kunnen helpen brengen
782380 commercie en redactie zijn nauw met elkaar vermengd volgens overgoor zijn kijkers clever genoeg om dat als zodanig te herkennen
782381 daar prikt iedereen toch zo doorheen je moet niet suggereren dat je een beetje onafhankelijk bent zodra je meent je in het grijze gebied te kunnen begeven moet je heel erg oppassen je krijgt krampachtige reportages die een beetje van de kool en een beetje van de geit laten zien en aan het eind niet geloofwaardig zijn wij produceren met open vizier voor de opdrachtgever we zullen dit nooit journalistiek noemen de afzender is helder daarnaast heb je journalistiek met haar eigen belangrijke functie

782385 pues lo que se debe considerar es que a esa edad ellas tienen una mayor carga de responsabilidad y presi n social que los hombres est n obligadas a manejar la familia y a rendir econ mica y profesionalmente
782386 lo curioso es que si bien ese proceso estuvo mediado por discursos de igualdad y liberaci n que finalmente le abrieron espacios lo que al final ocurri es que no se liber de las responsabilidades que tra a y en cambio s sum a su vida otras cargas no creo que ellas sean m s felices a los 20 lo que pasa es que son un poco m s maduras que ellos a esa edad y est n tranquilas con respecto a distintos aspectos de su vida

782394 the rangers faced attendance problems for a few years after moving to texas in part due to the teams uneven performance and in part due to the oppressive heat that can overtake the area in the summer until the florida marlins arrived in 1993 arlington stadium was the hottest stadium in the majors with temperatures frequently topping 100 degrees during the day in part because of this the rangers began playing most of their games between may and september at night a tradition that continues to this day they usually get a waiver from espn to play sunday night games

782396 hi everyone and a very pleasant good evening to you wherever you may be

782398 it is an honour for derry republicans to host the national hungerstrike rally this year and we intend to make it a major success and a fine tribute to our fallen comrades the theme for this years march is the struggle continues and it is apt that we are organising a republican youth weekend as it will be the modern day youth who are the inheritors and activists who will ensure the continuity and successful conclusion of the struggle
782399 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
782400 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
782401 it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year
782402 but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches
782403 in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
782404 its huge because to win these tournaments is tough nowadays ive played five days in these conditions and had eight or nine matches in the last couple of weeks but ive put in the physical work and its paid off
782405 weve known each other since we were 14 and to think six or seven years ago wed have been playing in finals like this would have been unbelievable
782406 id also like to thank my team ive been working with them for seven or eight months now and i forgot my brother jamie hes sometimes more of a hindrance but thanks anyway
782407 ive really enjoyed this week and im looking forward to coming back next year and defending my title

782410 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
782411 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
782412 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
782413 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
782414 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
782415 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
782416 we are very proud of the insignia and decided that an extraordinary car needed an extraordinary entrance thats why we choose to drop in at one of londons most frequented and iconic locations tower bridge just next to the london assembly

782497 is an honorable and worthwhile pursuit the state department has conducted outreach to the wrong groups sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding hosting and embracing of radical groups that purport to be opposed to terrorism and extremism
782498 to support an ideology that focuses on eliminating secular western powers and promoting their stringent ideas of sharia law
782499 this approach will help to aggrandize fundamentalist theology worldwide the focus of the state departments funding should promote genuinely moderate voices within the muslim community rather than reaching out to those who justify violence support designated terrorist groups and promote the funding and support of jihadist ideology globally

782527 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
782528 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

782553 treated water from the aqua reviva can be stored for an unlimited period of time unlike alternative diversion systems where the water must be used within 24 hours
782554 as the system constantly recycles grey water it can easily provide the home with a steady supply of water for everyday use even in periods when there is minimal rain to replenish rainwater tanks
782555 as global warming and consequential drought becomes a top of mind issue people respond by looking for significant ways to save water as a result of this general awareness in the community and our marketing efforts the demand for our products has increased significantly new water has seen a growth of 50 percent in the past six months alone
782556 whilst looking for a grey water treatment system for my own home i came across new waters aqua reviva system which i was very impressed with it was then that i also discovered the company had a great business opportunity available
782557 the aqua reviva can give householders continuous access to water for their garden washing machine or to flush the toilet even during low rainfall periods and strict water restrictions i thought it was a product act homes definitely needed
782558 homeowners need to think seriously about how rainwater tanks can make a real difference and we believe the rain reviva bladder tank is the best way to harness and store rainwater as well as save space around the house
782559 it is flexible enough to fit under a house or deck and can capture water from the entire surface area of the roof up to 300 percent faster than a standard tank system
782560 i had a look at the example of melbourne and potential costs associated with deferring the construction of the desalination plant for 10 years
782561 installing 156 000 domestic grey water treatment systems which would provide the equivalent water savings of a 110 ml d desalination plant as planned in victoria would potentially save the government and tax payers 1 05 billion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1 764 x 10
782562 the operation of a desalination plant will cost 55 188 000 and generate 945 000 tonnes of co2 annually in this case it would be equivalent to adding 210 000
782563 this melbourne example could be applied all around australia the adoption of a dgts policy by state governments is environmentally sound and financially justified in addition these figures could increase substantially as the energy prices rise and the costs of grey water treatment systems are likely to reduce over the period
782564 grey water recycling at household level can make a considerable difference in our water shortage problem as well as being an
782565 for example our aqua reviva grey water treatment system can recycle as much as 60 per cent of the household waste grey water water from shower and washing machine using a biological filtration system and a
782566 as the system constantly recycles grey water it can easily provide the home with a steady supply of water for everyday use even in periods when there is minimal rain to replenish rainwater tanks
782567 as global warming and consequential drought becomes a top of mind issue people respond by looking for significant ways to save water as a result of this general awareness in the community and our marketing efforts the demand for our products has increased significantly new water has seen a growth of 100 percent in the past six months alone
782568 we launched in new zealand in september 2006 and in all likelihood the next place of expansion for new water would be the united states as they are faced with many similar water shortage challenges that exist in australia
782569 i had been living overseas for five years came back for a visit and became aware of the water challenges facing australia i was introduced to the technology which we ultimately commercialised and saw that there was an exceptional business opportunity which not only had good commercial prospects but could also make a difference in the community
782570 treated water from the aqua reviva can be stored for an unlimited period of time unlike alternative diversion systems where the water must be used within 24 hours
782571 as the system constantly recycles grey water it can easily provide the home with a steady supply of water for everyday use especially in the garden even in periods when there is minimal rain to replenish rainwater tanks
782572 we thought it was such a waste to see the water we used for showers and in the washing machine going straight down the drain so we decided to do something about it
782573 by using treated recycled water for the garden and the washing machine and to flush the toilets we are maximising the use of our precious water whilst ensuring that our environment remains green and healthy
782574 water is a very scarce commodity and so when i came across new waters grey water treatment system at a home show in sydney i was very impressed with the concept and technology
782575 it can give householders continuous access to water for their garden washing machine or to flush the toilet even during low rainfall periods and strict water restrictions i thought it was a product south australian homes definitely needed
782576 south australians are very dependant on the murray river for their water supply and as the level goes down peoples water use will be restricted further the time will come when people will pay not only for the excess water but for all the water they consume
782577 the opportunity to use water twice by treating it through the aqua reviva grey water treatment system not only helps conserve potable water resources it will eventually equate to savings on households water bills
782578 homeowners need to think seriously about how they can make a real difference and we believe capturing rainwater and treating grey water are ideal solutions to reduce the negative impact on our water ways
782579 grey water recycling at household level can make a considerable difference in our water shortage problem as well as being an
782580 however the main hurdles companies like us face are not the performance of the systems but the lack of public awareness of a solution
782581 above all governments regulatory frameworks both at state and local level havent adapted to the technology some of them actually make it illegal to install sustainable grey water treatment systems whilst allowing direct diversion of grey water from shower and washing machine
782582 we have been consistently delayed during the application process by a lack of local policy and supporting administrative procedures which often results in the application being rejected as it cannot be processed in time
782583 weve also encountered council using its power to add additional monitoring requirements overriding the states guidance thus increasing the yearly operational costs by nearly 400 percent
782584 some local councils are also uncomfortable with the limitations that they have over the control of the systems discharge
782585 we want to work with government departments and local councils to help them introduce and or update their policy to facilitate the uptake of domestic grey water treatment systems
782586 manufacturers should also adequately identify reference to relevant codes and standards to help assessing officers with the approval process
782587 another solution is for manufacturers to form a binding contract with homeowners in which the manufacturer takes responsibility for the performance of the approved products
782588 meet me at the fence where we used to talk about things
782589 why did this happen to a kind guy like him
782590 its great to be able to utilise space around the house for gardens or other features that would normally have been sacrificed for unsightly water tanks
782591 besides the obvious benefit of being able to store rainwater the in slab tanks also add value to the property as it will give future homeowners a permanent means to store rainwater for use in the shower toilet and garden or to wash the car this is especially good during water restrictions
782592 homeowners need to think seriously about how rainwater tanks can make a real difference and we believe this is the best and most innovative way to harness and store rainwater the fact that the tanks stay out of sight is an obvious bonus
782593 the in slab tanks have a 660 litre capacity per unit although number of units that can be incorporated into the slab is limited only by the size and type of slab
782594 the project consists of four monumental man made waterfalls installed for three months at four sites along the shores of brooklyn manhattan and governors island one by the brooklyn anchorage of the brooklyn bridge one between piers 4 and 5 in brooklyn one in lower manhattan at pier 35 and one on the north shore of governors island the 90 to 120 foot tall installations which have been designed to protect water quality and aquatic life will operate from 7 a m to 10 p m seven days a week and will be lit after sunset adding a striking element to new york citys iconic skyline
782595 as global warming and consequential drought becomes a top of mind issue people respond by looking for significant ways to save water as a result of this general awareness in the community and our marketing efforts the demand for our products has increased significantly new water has seen a growth of 50 percent in the past six months alone

782646 i came here again to talk to troops and military leadership on the ground
782647 one thing i know for sure is that arkansas troops including the 39th are performing great i wanted to let them know that we appreciate their service and to find out how i could help them and their families
782648 many people know that i never rise to speak without asking those listening to remember to keep our men and women in uniform and their families in their thoughts and prayers as they serve our country
782649 one of the main reasons i wanted to make this trip to iraq was to see for myself that the troops have all the tools and resources they need while serving overseas their call to duty must be honored with our commitment to give them everything they need while serving abroad and when they return home i also wanted the opportunity to personally thank the troops for all they do and let them know that i continue to be humbled by their commitment to our nation
782650 i appreciate the sacrifices the soldiers and the families of the 39th infantry brigade are making
782651 im proud of the hard work our soldiers are doing to help continue the successful progress weve achieved in iraq
782652 it was an honor to meet the men and women of the 39th infantry brigade who have left behind their families friends and careers to answer the call of duty halfway across the world and i was proud to personally thank them for their selfless sacrifices
782653 we can never fully repay them for answering the call to duty but as a member of congress who represents many of these brave soldiers each week at our nations capitol i felt that it was my obligation to ensure that they have the best equipment and resources possible to allow them to effectively carry out their mission so that they can safely return home to their families
782654 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing weve ever seen before
782655 its an achievement nonetheless to be flat in this economy
782656 its a consumers paradise right now with cheap fares galore
782657 the incentives for taking the bus have never been better and it comes at an interesting time with airfares shooting up like a rocket
782658 people are looking for a simple way to get from point a to point b and in this economy buses are a great way to stretch that dollar
782659 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
782660 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
782661 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

782673 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure by multiplying the places and people with access to dangerous germs
782674 the petitioners theatrical movies are too valuable in this early distribution window to risk their exposure to unauthorized copying
782675 distribution over insecure outputs would facilitate the illegal copying and redistribution of this high value content causing untold damage to the dvd and other downstream markets
782676 what the mpaa is clearly trying to do here is start releasing movies on tv before theyre available on dvd
782677 but wants to do so in a way that users wont be able to record on their dvrs though they hardly come out and say that
782678 the use of soc by the studios would not deny consumers a right they presumptively have or a capability they currently enjoy
782679 the issue for the studios is whether unprotected outputs could be used to record the early release content in ways that are not currently permitted and then use that recording as the source for additional unauthorized copies
782680 cannot be left to the unfettered discretion of content owners and mvpds cable companies such unchecked authority places far too much power in the hands of content owners to the potential detriment of all other equally important stakeholders
782681 consumer electronics manufacturers such as tivo have made significant investments and brought innovative devices to market in reliance on the standards created by cablelabs
782682 for the new business model the waiver would make possible petitioners and mvpds should have the flexibility to use the technologies that are best suited to serve the needs of their mutual customers while balancing the need to protect their content
782683 there is no compelling need to establish an arbitrary fixed window for the proposed new services
782684 in fact there are compelling marketplace statistics that demonstrate such a regulatory limitation is unnecessary
782685 evidence which the mpaa has relied on in the past to demonstrate the dangers of the analog hole is unreliable and inapposite
782686 in the complete absence of evidence there is no reason to believe that additional costly restrictive technologies are needed
782687 the fact that almost no movies are made available to mvpds pre dvd release is clear and convincing evidence that the analog hole is an impediment to the early window release of high value content

782708 were focusing on whole genome sequencing now because we believe that this is the approach that will drive personal genomics forward an advantage for us to being first is that from inception weve built our platform and services specifically around whole genome applications and because were initially focusing on a limited number of clients we can provide first in class service customized and personalized to each individual client

782710 you know beer commercials imply that drinking their beer will make beautiful women fall all over you i think the genetic genealogy companies dont go below the normal standards of the marketplace but they dont go above it either some do a better job than others but theres not one that couldnt improve and that bothers me because theyre using science to sell their product and science is about the whole truth
782711 a lot of the genetic results are early weak and preliminary one worries that people will think the information is more powerful than it actually is and change their lives based on it
782712 genetic testing is already available practical even reimbursable primary care physicians dont have to wait for a huge leap in biotechnology for an inexpensive and non invasive genetic test that can today detect a two to threefold risk increase for diabetes cardiovascular disease stroke colorectal cancer breast cancer and ovarian cancer in some individuals the test can detect much higher disease risk for less common disorders like hemochromatosis thrombophilia and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
782713 in a time of microarrays and talk of full genome sequencing family history remains a cornerstone of the concept of truly personalized medicine and seems likely to become even more useful in the near future

782719 moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother now there were seven brothers the first one married a woman and died childless the second and then the third married her and in the same way the seven died leaving no children finally the woman died too not then at the resurrection whose wife will she be since the seven were married to her
782720 the people of this age marry and are given in marriage but those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage and they can no longer die for they are like the angels they are gods children since they are children of the resurrection but in the account of the bush even moses showed that the dead rise for he calls the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living for to him all are alive

782841 establishment of an arab school is a misguided and dangerous idea
782842 unless we all send a clear message that racist comments associating arabic language and culture with terrorism will not be tolerated we will continue to hear them again and again
782843 its a public school we all know that public school cant be faith based theres nothing about it that has to do with islam
782844 its arabs arab culture culture of the middle east the focus is dual language the goal is that every child graduates fluent in arabic
782845 it represents a vision of tolerance of community understanding thats what ny is about should be about what the academy is based on
782846 whats happened with this situation is a great deal of misinformation about the school debbie and arab organisations in our community
782847 then remember me i will remember you be grateful to me and do not reject me
782848 and be grateful to all h if it is him you worship
782849 what can all h gain by your punishment if you are grateful and you believe
782850 this is by the grace of my lord to test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful and if any is grateful truly his gratitude is a gain for his own soul but if any is ungrateful truly my lord is free of all needs supreme in honour
782851 if you reject all h truly all h has no need of you but he likes not ingratitude from his slaves if you are grateful he is pleased with you
782852 muhammad is no more than a messenger many were the messengers that passed away before him if he died or were slain will you then turn back on your heels if any did turn back on his heels not the least harm will he do to all h but all h on the other hand will swiftly reward those who serve him with gratitude
782853 if you are grateful i will add more favours unto you
782854 but if you fear poverty soon will all h enrich you if he wills
782855 nay on him would you call and if it be his will he would remove the distress which occasioned your call upon him
782856 he forgives whom he wills and he punishes whom he wills
782857 again will all h after this turn in mercy to whom he will
782858 and swiftly shall we reward those that serve us with gratitude
782859 but all h will swiftly reward those who serve him with gratitude
782860 then will i assault them from before them and behind them from their right and their left nor will you find in most of them gratitude for your mercies
782861 and be grateful to all h if it is him you worship
782862 o m s i have chosen you above other men by the mission i have given you and the words i have spoken to you take then the revelation which i give you and be of those who give thanks
782863 ibr h m was indeed a model devoutly obedient to all h and true in faith and he joined not gods with allah he showed his gratitude for the favours of all h who chose him and guided him to a straight way
782864 it is he who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when you knew nothing and he gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affection that you may give thanks to all h
782865 all h had helped you at badr when you were a contempt ible little force then fear all h thus may you show your gratitude
782866 then remember me i will remember you be grateful to me and do not reject me
782867 islam began as something strange and it shall return to being something strange so give glad tidings to the strangers
782868 if only there had been in the generations preceding you people having wisdom prohibiting others from evil in the earth except a few of those whom we have saved from among them
782869 islam began as something strange and it shall return to being something strange so give glad tidings ar tooba this is a tree in paradise so the prophet peace be upon him is giving the good news of paradise to these strangers to the strangers
782870 those that correct my sunnah which has been corrupted by the people after me
782871 they are a small group of people among a large evil population those who oppose them are more than those who follow them
782872 and if you obey most of the people on earth they will lead you astray
782873 and most of mankind will not believe even if you o muhammad desire it eagerly
782874 and truly most of mankind are rebellious and disobedient to allah
782875 will you not go as the other people have gone
782876 we had abandoned the people in this life and we were more in need of them then we are today and we will wait for our lord whom we used to worship
782877 it is possible that a disheveled dusty person with not many belongings literally
782878 a believer is a stranger in this world he is never afraid of its humiliation and he never competes for its glory
782879 o you who believe take care of your own selves if you follow right guidance no harm can come to you from those who err
782880 nay indeed order good and forbid evil until you see stinginess being obeyed and desires being followed and this world preferred over the next and each person being deluded by his own opinions then take care of yourself and leave the common people for indeed after you there will be days of patience where patience will be like holding on to glowing embers whoever is able to do this will have the reward of fifty people that do like him
782881 o messenger of allah the reward of fifty of them
782882 live in this world as though you are a stranger or a wayfarer

782885 the faith of a servant is not put right until his heart is put right and his heart is not put right until his tongue is put right
782886 do not talk excessively without remembering all h because such excessive talk without the mention of all h causes the heart to harden and the person furthest from all h is a person with a hard heart
782887 a person who talks too much is a person who often makes mistakes and someone who often makes mistakes often has wrong actions the fire has a priority over such a freqent sinner
782888 shall i not tell you how to control all that
782889 oh prophet of all h are we accountable for what we say
782890 may your mother be bereft by your loss is there anything more than the harvest of the tongues that throws people on their faces or he said on their noses into the fire
782891 what mostly causes people to be sent to the fire are the two openings the mouth and the private parts
782892 the servant speaks words the consequences of which he does not realise and for which he is sent down into the depths of the fire further than the distance between the east and the west
782893 the servant says something that he thinks is harmless and for which he will be plunged into the depths of the fire as far as seventy autumns
782894 guard your tongue make your house suffice for sheltering your privacy and weep for your wrong actions
782895 whoever can guarantee what is between his jaws and what is between his legs i guarantee him the garden
782896 let whoever believes in all h and the last day either speak good or remain silent
782897 everything the children of adam say goes against them except for their enjoining good and forbidding evil and remembering all h glorius and might is he
782898 by all h besides whom no god exists nothing deserves a long prison sentence more than my tongue
782899 o tongue say good and you will profit desist from saying evil things and you will be safe otherwise you will find only regret
782900 a person will not feel greater fury or anger for any part of his body on the day of judgement more than what he will feel for his tongue unless he only used it for saying or enjoining good
782901 whoever does not hold his tongue cannot understand his deen
782902 one of the merits of a persons isl m is his abandoning what does not concern him
782903 one of the signs of all hs abandoning a servant is his making him preoccupied with what does not concern him
782904 whoever talks about what does not concern him is deprived of truthfulness
782905 whoever enriches his outward behaviour by follwing the sunnah and makes his inward soul weathy thorugh contemplation and averts his gaze away from looking at what is forbidden and avoids anything of a doubtful nature and feeds soley on what is hal l his inner sight will never falter
782906 i heard the messenger of all h sallall hu alayhi wa sallam say
782907 do not eat too much otherwise you will drink too much and then you will end up sleeping too much and then you will lose too much
782908 from the time of their arrival in madina up until his death saw the family of muhammad sallall hu alayhi wa sallam never ate their fill of bread made from wheat three nights in a row
782909 any one who controls his stomach is in control of his deen and anyone who controls his hunger is in control of good behaviour disobedience towards all h is nearest to a person who is satiated with a full stomach and furthest away from a person who is hungry
782910 how odd that some people mourn for the one whose body has died but never mourn for the one whose heart has died and yet the death of the heart is far more serious
782911 let whoever believes in all h and the last day either speak good or remain silent and let whoever believes in all h and the last day be generous to his neighbour and let whoever believes in all h and the last day be generous to his guest

783159 our dreams are a second life i have never been able to penetrate without a shudder those ivory or horned gates which separate us from the invisible world the first moments of sleep are an image of death a hazy torpor grips our thoughts and it becomes impossible for us to determine the exact instant when the i under another form continues the task of existence little by little a vague underground cavern grows lighter and the pale gravely immobile shapes that live in limbo detach themselves from the shadows and the night then the picture takes form a new brightness illumines these strange apparitions and gives them movement the spirit world opens before us swedenborg called these visions memorabilia he owed them more often to musing than to sleep the golden ass of apuleius dantes divine comedy are two poetic models of such studies of the human soul following their example i am going to try to describe the impressions of a long illness which took place entirely within the mysteries of my soul i do not know why i use the word illness for as my physical self was concerned i never felt better sometimes i thought my strength and energy were doubled i seemed to know everything understand everything my imagination gave me infinite delight in recovering what men call reason do i have to regret the loss of those joys

783357 yeah he was here for a bit earlier so why did she say she was going over there
783358 huh i told you that she didnt tell me why are you so insistent that she did maybe there is something that you should be telling me
783359 what dont try and change this around on me how the hell would i know why she was going to jaspers we just fucking met him last night
783360 hey im sorry i just thought that maybe they had met at the party last night hit it off and were possibly talking now i didnt know it was illegal for a guy to check up on his kid sister
783361 it its not im sorry i didnt mean to bite off your head i just really miss her
783362 its all good you know i could never stay mad at you you are too pretty i realize that you miss her
783363 is there anything new going on with you and my sister
783364 if i knew what you meant then i wouldnt have asked dont you think
783365 she talks about you non stop your name is doodled on her journal and you two are always together i just thought that maybe you girls had taken your friendship to a higher level im sorry i was just curious it doesnt matter
783366 no it is okay i suppose everyone will know soon enough there is nothing really going on we just kissed a few times it was nothing really
783367 oh my god you are so busted you little nymph
783368 i am not busted because i am not guilty just curious also you better not tell her that we had this conver
783369 nothing sis we were just talking about this girl that i met at the coffee shop
783370 i am so sorry that i did not get here sooner jasper and shan had a pretty nasty break up last night and there was an accident shan is here in the same hospital and they wouldnt let jasper in to see her so i went to tell her how she was doing and what all i found out
783371 but i am here now and i am so happy to see you i missed you and thought about you all night how did you sleep did that imbecile even come like he said he would
783372 i am glad that you are here i missed you too and yes david came to see me he left earlier thats not important now though i want to know all about what happened with shan and jasper
783373 i dont know if i should say anything or not jasper asked me not to
783374 for one it is rude to start a story and leave the listener hanging i hate cliffhangers and for two i am your best friend how can you deny me
783375 okay i guess that you are right i shouldnt even have started telling you about it but i thought you should know why i wasnt here when i said that i would be now i will finish since you have clearly stated how bad you hate cliffhangers
783376 i guess last night after your accident everyone was leaving the party and jasper couldnt find shan anywhere he went upstairs looking for her and found her in the guest bedroom with some other guy i dont know who it was though anyways he freaked out and started yelling at her and that guy thats all i know about that part but when the two of them left and went home shan supposedly called jasper trying to apologize to him and he told her that it was over she tried to kill herself after he hung up the phone her little sister found her and called 9 1 1 i dont know anything else except jasper feels really bad and wants to see her but the hospital wont let him because her family denied him access to her room so i went and talked to her sister ally she told me what they found out and i went then i went and told jasper that she was going to be okay thats it
783377 yeah it is they looked so happy last night you really dont know who the other guy was
783378 nope jasper didnt tell me he said he wouldnt tell me how fucked up is that
783379 jacob is there something that you should be telling me
783380 you and jasper i dont know you were just getting so defensive i thought that maybe you and jasper had taken your friendship to a higher level
783381 im just kidding sweetie i know that you like me so why would i have to worry about jasper i am much better looking and much more tempting that jasper
783382 josie baby i think that maybe you should take a nap you are delusional

783503 berlusconi dice che chi non vota per lui un coglione noi difendiamo il suo diritto a dirlo e discettiamo sulla parola coglione per due anni
783504 ma che lo lascino fare questo lodo alfano che glielo diano e passiamo avanti ai problemi quelli veri della gente

783515 at 20 08 million barrels per day total demand was the lowest in five years and the decline in gasoline demand was the first significant one recorded in 17 years higher pump prices and a slowing economy were undoubtedly factors
783516 dont blame us for high gas prices republicans voted against drilling too
783517 dont blame us for gas prices even republicans voted against drilling
783518 it is remarkable because at room temperature the oil is as thick as peanut butter
783519 pfc energy a washington consulting firm counts projects worth perhaps 1 5 billion that will total more than 300 million gallons of capacity by 2011
783520 enough biodiesel to replace all petroleum transportation fuels could be grown in 15 000 square miles or roughly 12 5 percent of the area of the sonora desert note for clarification i am not advocating putting 15 000 square miles of algae ponds in the sonora desert this hypothetical example is used strictly for the purpose of showing the scale of land required that 15 000 square miles works out to roughly 9 5 million acres far less than the 450 million acres currently used for crop farming in the us and the over 500 million acres used as grazing land for farm animals
783521 what the president would like to do is to have validation for his failed policy
783522 ill praise you in this storm and i will lift my hands for you are who you are no matter where i am and every tear i cry you hold in your hand you never left my side and though my heart is torn i will praise you in this storm

783524 when not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection yet my son shay cannot learn things as other children do he cannot understand things as other children do where is the natural order of things in my son
783525 i believe that when a child like shay who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself and it comes in the way other people treat that child
783526 were losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning i guess he can be on our team and well try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning
783527 the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world
783528 i am going to introduce legislation that will require the president to sell 500 000 barrels of oil a day for a six month period and to require that he put together a plan to repurchase heavy crude over a five year period in order to replenish the oil
783529 global oil supply rebounded by 490 kb d in may to average 86 6 mb d
783530 non opec supply is seen rising 640 kb d to 50
783531 does that mean that non opec supply is currently 50 0mb d or is it less than that now and expected to rise to 50 0mb d in late 2008
783532 opec crude supply increased by 350 kb d in june to 32 4 mb d
783533 the l e d a type of semiconductor generates light when an electric current is passed through positive and negative materials energy is given off in the form of heat and light different colors and greater efficiency are created by altering the composition of the material typically a compact fluorescent bulb uses about 20 percent of the energy needed for a standard bulb to create the same amount of light todays l e d s use about 15 percent next generation bulbs still in the labs do even better
783534 if we are at or near peak oil then we will switch to evs such as the gm volt
783535 thats a good point let me clarify i think there is a 10 chance that we have peaked and a 10 chance peak is more than 5 years away i think there is an 80 chance the peak will occur between now and 5 years from now
783536 thats a good point let me clarify i think there is a 5 chance that we have peaked and a 40 chance peak is more than 5 years away i think there is an 55 chance the peak will occur between now and 5 years from now

783541 the key to this approach is that the alternatives must deliver when they are needed and they must cover severe shortfalls what if they dont
783542 end of the day were talking about 1 5 million barrels per day in an 86 0 million barrels per day world
783543 but they should be liable as hell if anything goes wrong
783544 thats why nearly every nuclear power program in the world is operated by a federal monopoly
783545 50 billion barrels of oil and as much as 90 billion
783546 environmentalists argue nuclear is too expensive and takes too long because environmentalists file lawsuits that make it very expensive and delay construction
783547 plan b is coal coal fired power coal based liquid fuels
783548 fixed price contracts for retail power in texas are runing 17 18 cts kwh month to month can go as high as 25 cts natural gas combined cycle is on the margin in texas 24 7 and simple cycle sets the summer day price i laugh at 6 000 kw
783549 and once nat gas goes into depletion with nuclear off the table well
783550 china is building coal plants like crazy in fact theyre planning to do ctl as well betcha anything we start exporting coal to them
783551 the 2007 chevrolet volt concept vehicle that appeared in the detroit auto show 16 introduced the e flex 17 drive system which is an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity generating systems the initial design as envisioned in the volt combines an electric motor and 16 kwh 58 mj lithium ion battery plug in system 18 with a small engine 1 liter powered by gasoline linked to a 53 kw 71 hp generator the vehicle is propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of 120 kw 160 hp ordinarily the vehicle would be charged while at home overnight plug in hybrid the vehicle has two charging ports for convenience one on each side 19 a full charge reportedly takes 6 5 hours from a standard north american 120 v 15 a household outlet
783552 i am puzzled as to why people think opening new leases will actually solve anything
783553 adding some 1 5 of the daily world use production isnt going to change the open market price significantly
783554 any demand that it be kept in the us and sold for less is a fools hope
783555 what oil company would spend a bazillion dollars drilling for oil off california under those conditions if it could spend the same bazillion dollars and drill off africa or wherever without such strings
783556 but deep water drill ships arent made in the us
783557 and the profits go to exxon et al and like exxon is a us owned company what ever that means not
783558 i just dont see any logic in the argument that more drilling will solve our energy problem
783559 so everybody wastes a whole bunch of effort time and money on a solution that really isnt a solution

783576 pows cooked food that arrived in the red cross parcels and boiled water for their tea that they loved to drink very hot using special heaters made by themselves these were made with the klim condensed milk tin to which was added a small fan that was turned manually with this system it was possible to produce the maximum heat using the smallest quantity of wood or any inflammable rubbish found in the camp the klim heater was invented by a pow who was an engineer and it met such a success that it could be found in practically all the camps thanks to the pows who were transferred
783577 one of the new zealanders built blowers out of tin cans
783578 nothing was wasted we burned up the wooden boxes that the red cross supplies came in we picked up branches that blew down in the yard from trees and wed strip bark off the tree trunks we lived fairly well there because things were organized

783580 the great difference between present day christianity and that of which we read in these letters new testament epistles
783581 we are apt to reduce the christian religion to a code or at best a rule of heart and life to these men it is quite plainly the invasion of their lives by a new quality of life altogether they do not hesitate to describe this as christ living in them
783582 dear father i need you i acknowledge that i have sinned against you by directing my own life i thank you that you have forgiven my sins through christs death on the cross for me i now invite christ to again take his place on the throne of my life fill me with the holy spirit as you commanded me to be filled and as you promised in your word that you would do if i asked in faith i pray this in the name of jesus
783583 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories

783627 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
783628 the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
783629 temperatures in the last half of a century tend to be hotter than the first primarily because of sunspot cycles back in the 70s the fear was of an impending ice age
783630 a greenhouse traps heat but the earths atmosphere isnt a greenhouse even if a region could retain more heat throughout the summer theres nothing preventing that excessive heat from escaping during winter months
783631 the scientific debate has been conducted in science journals over the past 30 years and is more or less done
783632 sunspot numbers over the past 11 400 years have been reconstructed using dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional the last period of similar magnitude occurred over 8 000 years ago
783633 i advised pew that pew should be in the background and by law the grantees always have to disclose but i always encouraged the grantees never to mention pew
783634 did we push the envelope yeah were we encouraged internally to push the envelope yeah we stayed with the letter if not the spirit of the law
783635 if congress thought this was a pew effort itd be worthless
783636 to convey the impression that this was something coming naturally from beyond the beltway
783637 my point is this it may well be that human activity is indeed changing the climate at least in part but there is an increasing body of science that says that the sun may have a greater role
783638 the real explaination as i keep hammering away is that there are more variables involved
783639 if theres no natural explanation it stands to reason that the temperature increase is caused by humans
783640 the climate is so complex that we shouldnt even attempt to understand it
783641 the climate is so simple that if it cant be explained in 1 variable then that variable cant have any impact

783712 its for courageous people we are a small group but we are committed
783713 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
783714 we do so little in our country to promote programs like the one we have in our backyard
783715 the poor need us most when the times are tough
783716 it is clearly a program that speaks for itself in terms of success

783718 leave the oil in the spr it is for war time type emergencies
783719 we found this man misleading our people he opposes the payment of taxes to caesar and maintains that he is the messiah a king
783720 he is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all judea from galilee where he began even to here
783721 you brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt i have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him nor did herod for he sent him back to us so no capital crime has been committed by him therefore i shall have him flogged and then release him
783722 what evil has this man done i found him guilty of no capital crime therefore i shall have him flogged and then release him
783723 daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me weep instead for yourselves and for your children for indeed the days are coming when people will say blessed are the barren the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed at that time people will say to the mountains fall upon us and to the hills cover us for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry
783724 he saved others let him save himself if he is the chosen one the messiah of god
783725 have you no fear of god for you are subject to the same condemnation and indeed we have been condemned justly for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes but this man has done nothing criminal
783726 amen i say to you today you will be with me in paradise

783732 duas das nossas professoras perceberam que havia um n vel de escolaridade muito baixo entre as m es das crian as que estudavam pela manh e tarde na escola quando aconteciam as reuni es essas m es n o conseguiam expor as necessidades de seus filhos portanto a compreens o era dif cil
783733 eu estimulo meus alunos a pensarem nos seus problemas como li es did ticas e no final eles v em os resultados no dia a dia o processo se inverte e eles acabam colocando em pr tica o que aprenderam em sala de aula

783738 for every man there comes that special moment when he is physically tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing unique to him and fitted to his talents what a tragedy if that moment finds him unprepared or unqualified for the work which would be his finest hour

783745 what would be more worthwhile for the uae than to be able to build not only the tallest physical tower in the world but also one of the highest intellectual endeavors like that of building intelligent humanlike humanoid robots
783746 the reawakening of interest in leading intellectual figures such as ibn sina is of foremost importance to the region human like robots are an amazing platform for research in multiple fields related to artificial intelligence including computer vision motor control and language processing robots are fun and inspiring so there are educational benefits as well providing a unique tool for combining theory with real world hands on technological skills
783747 it can also teach us a lot about ourselves too in order to build such a machine one needs to really learn and self reflect not only about the human body but also about the human mind one needs to understand and model perception belief intentions and even emotions
783748 we produce enough oil right here in america to fuel 60 million cars
783749 the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of political ends
783750 one of the features i like to mention about microsoft crm is that it is easy to use
783751 you know when you get people especially sales and marketing people together with a new application and system its very well known that they have this resistance to any new application
783752 bluelink did a good thing for us which was to gather all the staff that would be using this system and show them the benefits of the system and how it would save them time and effort when they had been acknowledged and they knew that ok the system in the beginning would be a bit hard because of updating the data and using a new system they also knew that after the full implementation of the system it would be very efficient for them really save them time and effort and all the data would be there
783753 we researched the partners and came up with information on companies that specialised in crm and we knew that bluelink was a microsoft partner here in kuwait and in my personal opinion and my managers agree with me on this id like to have somebody here in kuwait its easier and much more cost effective especially when its an application that needs so much customisation
783754 before we were using an in house portal to manage all our connections and clients and we found that with our growth we really do need something more efficient like a crm to manage our client dealings invoicing and to be more efficient because we are expanding our customer base
783755 we felt that we needed such a technology because our business and our customer base were expanding and we needed something to monitor this without a crm you cannot monitor this you cannot just manually go customer name by customer name and calculate their length of contract and their services
783756 arab telecom company was established in 1984 and the major activity at that time was communications consultancy with the ministry of communication in kuwait
783757 the move to the middle east has been as a result of a few factors first the commercial reasons as in my experience the enterprises in this region have always been extremely innovative in adopting and promoting new technology and second because of its location and great access to almost anywhere in the world
783758 database security is about keeping people from getting their hands on information that could be damaging to the individual or organisation the growth in the middle east is off the charts with huge enterprises like emirates airlines hiring 500 people a week at that rate when it comes to logging sensitive data gaps begin to appear secerno stops those gaps being exploited and then fills them says kerry koutsikos secernos vice president for southern europe middle east and africa regions
783759 secerno technology eradicates the insider threat problem be it cyber terrorism or just an employee hitting the wrong key and sending your information out our product is constantly looking for that anomalous behaviour the reality is sql injections are on the rise but we stop them all
783760 the problem is that dbas can do what they want when they want we have the ability not only to audit them but to stop them from accessing specific data for example we can stop a dba from accessing payroll information although the database cannot stop this
783761 basically we can control what users see do and work on within a database and application
783762 historically it takes days to implement a product like this we can set our product up within two hours and its up protecting you instantly its a non intrusive product and the manageability of the system is first class due to our clustering technique
783763 we have already appointed one partner in saudi arabia and are busy talking with another we will initially focus our efforts on the gcc nations and recruit a group of skilled security partners to ensure a unique boutique model
783764 this product lends itself to anyone who has a database and an application practically any vertical that said we are focused on the biggest companies like telcos financial institutions and even governments
783765 if you come to the emerging world we suffer from a lack of infrastructure
783766 if you look at countries such as the democratic republic of congo with a population approaching 70 million people and spread over a huge area the total amount of constructed roads is no more than 5km so you can see how difficult it is to operate in such areas
783767 the equity of the telephone call plays to compensate for a lack in infrastructure to a big degree hence people are willing to pay a bigger percentage of their disposable income on their telephone calls
783768 as opposed to people like myself digital natives are more into using the internet digital technology and network technology for them it is not only a technical capability it is how they work and interact with friends
783769 for these new players advertising is the main source of their revenue they are giving away content for free and yes they are attracting more people to their sites because their revenue is based on how many people they attract this is extremely dangerous for an operator
783770 whats so great about the mc75 is that it uses the latest communication features like 3g which utilises hsdpa high speed downlink packet access at about 100kb per second so you can send information and data and at the same time communicate a lot of customers in the oil and gas sector will have field technicians going out on the rigs doing their jobs what they will be able to do is capture information images or videos about what is happening in a situation and then send it in a secure and fast manner with this device
783771 if youre in a situation where someone is trying to locate a rig in the middle of the desert at the moment they have scouts who know the area and the desert with the gps they will know where the location is because they can track it via gps and then it will direct them
783772 whats very important to the company is to make sure they can mange the large number of field technicians that they have in multiple different locations if they are doing things in a manually to enter information onto the system will take days however with such a device the information can be uploaded to the system in real time
783773 in such cases and in our capacity as an escrow service we receive the item back from the buyer and have it tested with a material expert for example a watch that is suspected of being a counterfeit will be taken to the dealer agent and tested and certified
783774 if the test reveals that the item is in fact a counterfeit then the buyer receives a refund and the seller receives a warning to not repeat the offence the sellers account is suspended for a limited time period as a penalty if the offence is repeated by the same seller again their account will be suspended indefinitely and they become barred from using the souq services if the test and certification confirms that the item is in fact legitimate then the buyer can proceed with their purchase with peace of mind knowing that their purchase was in fact legitimate in every way
783775 with over 40 000 items on the site at any given time and growing and without the assistance of the intellectual property owners not all counterfeits can realistically be identified and removed
783776 if its available anyone could potentially be a buyer of a fake item and stopping buyers from accessing the site will mean that our legitimate sellers will be deprived of legitimate sales to those same buyers
783777 from the airlines perspective they can certainly reduce the cost of using a travel agent and distribution for the passengers they also want to shop for the best price so airlines and consumers are both trying to reduce this intermediary which is increasing their costs
783778 i think they compliment each other i dont think that one will really take the lead over the other
783779 i think the revolution is clearly moving online its a channel that didnt even exist a few years back
783780 but it will not and id say it will never replace the face to face relationship that a professional can have with his customers the online channel will allow the travel consultant to focus on added value services so its an opportunity rather than a threat
783781 i think this online revolution has started very recently and if you look at my hotel the total last year of room nights from online was 5
783782 this proposal is a hat trick for america its good for our environment good for our national security and good for drivers who are suffering at the pump natural gas is cheap green and american made and its time we encouraged the use of natural gas vehicles here in america
783783 american drivers should be able to buy a car that runs on a cleaner fuel that is currently half the cost of gas developing cars that run on natural gas and making it available at the gas station or at home will save money for consumers and help end our dependence on foreign oil
783784 its time to start making those reserves work for us
783785 its good for our environment good for our national security and good for drivers who are suffering at the pump
783786 whats wrong with me am i not attractive am i not interesting is it really that difficult to talk to me am i so unapproachable or is it just that nobody wants to approach me
783787 dear bull pardon me if i have disturbed your peaceful afternoon with the weight of my body on your horns i offer you one thousand apologies for i never meant to inconvenience you with my presence at all i wouldnt want you to think i didnt care about your solitude and comfort
783788 i pull away and she looks so happy for just a second like everything has come together in a champagne bubble of a moment
783789 come in sit down ill make us something to drink i have muffins in the kitchen or would you rather have water when i was first pregnant with andrew i couldnt stand anything stronger than a glass of water for two weeks i lost five pounds
783790 water sounds good well no a bottle of tequila sounds good but again pregnant
783791 whats got you down is rex still being a jerk about that pharmacy guy
783792 no im thinking about your problem and i wish you hadnt made a scene gabby things would be so much easier if you hadnt
783793 gabrielle are you are you absolutely sure you dont want to have children
783794 even more now that im enjoying all the fun symptoms of pregnancy never wanted them dont want them never will want them but what can i do turn back time
783795 rex knows people who do that sort of thing it could be could have been arranged very quietly
783796 i know you dont think thats the right thing to do
783797 i know that you wouldnt have just forgotten to take your pills either this wasnt your choice was it
783798 men are so willing to believe certain things and you wear such impractical shoes sweetheart
783799 i dont stick around but i dont know where id go
783800 andrew is having homosexual crushes and i think he hates me
783801 if youre sure you should tell me very soon we can set a date
783802 are you saying drill the coast and damn the consequences oil at any price
783803 about 7 200 wells have been drilled offshore california with one blowout in 1969
783804 in 2000 approximately 36 million barrels bbl of oil were produced from federal waters in offshore california all of which was transmitted to shore by pipeline in comparison approximately 260 million bbl of crude oil and distillates e g gasoline are transported by tanker along the california coast each year the largest oil spill from offshore oil operations in california was the 1969 80 000 bbl santa barbara spill which resulted in the loss of thousands of birds since 1969 only one spill from oil and gas operations offshore california has resulted in documented seabird mortality the 163 bbl 6846 gallons platform irene pipeline spill off point arguello in 1997 which resulted in the loss of more than 700 birds
783805 funny thing about the extraction industry the oil companies get all the profit and the locals get stuck with the mess
783806 time is occasionally kind when youre no longer young and impatient
783807 te perdendo eu cresci tanto que eu n o sei se quero mais te encontrar
783808 we want to be the remote control to your bank balance
783809 an insight into how to improve market penetration by profitably targeting the low income market segments
783810 the constant availability of top up and the opportunity for micro prepaid options ensure the sustainability of the operators monthly arpu
783811 this is clearly reflected in the case of grameen phone where with a 250 growth in top up transactions the arpu for prepaid users was 6 30
783812 are we making something up or is this a true story
783813 a lot of business intelligence software is very complex and this is where we step in weve taken a different approach by putting the end user at the centre of the universe if its simple for the end user it is going to be used
783814 if you look at the traditional players we compete against they have very lengthy installations they always cost millions of dollars two out of three projects are unsuccessful what we do instead is we do it in ten days you dont have to spend millions you can spend a few hundred thousand dollars and as far as we know every one of our users is happy
783815 weve only been operating for a few months but weve already signed some big name clients we think its the right time to make the region aware of the incoming product
783816 qlikview helped me weve been in the software industry since 2001 and we have applications to manage archives document management and workflow so we needed to do analysis on our processes who is doing what when and what if we do this it actually answered our needs in these areas and i thought there was a whole lot more it could do
783817 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
783818 i feel horrible i cant go to the doctor i cant drive
783819 but you have to go he isnt going to be in for the rest of the week this was the last appointment he had open before you leave
783820 mom i saw the biggest spider ive ever seen including tarantulas
783821 thats nice honey you did pack the insect repellent didnt you
783822 id have thought dutch elm was a thing of the past along with all the trees
783823 growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell
783824 you mean you would dare allow a demon to put a finger on your skin for the love of me
783825 like two humans taking over the pit but probably not im just pointing out its a flaw in the neat circularity they were going for
783826 if we forget that we understand our own punishments then perhaps the balance can stand oh my beloved sith lord
783827 how can you understand the whole of things without the dark side i mean okay its like faust he wanted to know more and he was punished its like adam and eve what the hell kind of god bitchslaps an entire species for curiosity
783828 its not about knowledge its about arrogance about thinking the ends justify the means
783829 why shouldnt people use whatever means they have and like your side doesnt do it all the time
783830 the ends do not justify the means or free will is well buggered basically
783831 do the means justify the ends if i choose to do something good in the pursuit of evil where does it count or even if i do something perfectly nice like say have mind blowing good sex with you because i know youll make sure i have four orgasms for your every one does my selfishness negate my generosity
783832 my dear you have a slant notion of generous if you believe your sexual desire qualifies
783833 so your honesty lover hurts me a lot i do love you you know
783834 are we discussing generosity or the ends and the means
783835 and our endless dilemna and punishment we can be happy we can be powerful but not perfectly so and well distrust both to the end of days
783836 right up to the part where you incorporated their off and on realizations that they are being punished into the mix
783837 the punishments had to be nearly equal or one of the arrogant little gits would have wrecked the balance
783838 remember i was in charge of designing the rewards for the other side or perhaps you think that house palatial seat of power i suppose is really a hell
783839 very very clever of both of us balancing that pair for their productive capabilities
783840 nearly every customer i talk to over here wants to discuss virtualisation its quite literaly busy changing the server world
783841 consolidation is one initial step in virtualisation but what about the next steps what are the challenges for my business and what is the long term goal i want to achieve with virtualisation its really about having this clear vision the virtual world is so complex that you cant always make these decisions on your own and thats why you need to have partners who can help you determine your objectives and requirements and map a route to achieving them
783842 i also see a transformation of the datacentre to a dynamic datacentre virtualisation can help change computation to whatever your future demands will be you can actually be much quicker in adapting to new challenges those are the main themes for virtualisation in the next two years
783843 we aim to form strong relationships with both vendors and end users we can add value to the region because we have experience on a global level and can bring that expertise to the middle east
783844 werent we supposed to be on the cover of this weeks people
783845 you mean another cover of us as teri and the pussycats the one where she got twenty minutes longer in makeup than we did while we tried not to get drenched in another freak la rain shower
783846 why is a has been like aaron echolls taking up valuable space on the cover
783847 and look everyone except teri is basically cut into pieces and unrecognizable what did aaron do exactly did he get caught having sex with someone again i mean its horrible about lynn but thats been off the covers for weeks
783848 oh i remember reading about that that was horrible she was the daughter of some microsoft guy was only like seventeen and some asshole beat her head in
783849 and aaron wants to help out and is offering a reward to find the real killer
783850 oh is that the people with aaron echolls on the cover instead of us
783851 isnt that awful my nose looks pointy in that picture and you can barely see you guys
783852 i didnt say it wasnt horrible about lilly kanes murder
783853 we heard you its awful that your heads not bigger
783854 i mean we cant even see marcia but oh no its an insult to you its like were teri and the pussycats or something
783855 i wasnt aware i was involved in this at all
783856 personally i think finding justice for this poor kid eclipses our fights about who goes where in the picture for once but just this once
783857 im going back to my trailer tell marc to give me an hour
783858 stop doing that ted casablanca hates me enough already because he thinks ive betrayed gayness i dont need you manipulating teri and screwing me over in the process
783859 i dont care stop it theyre going to have to redo her makeup if she cries and if theres something we dont need its marc in a bitchy mood because you needed a new pair of shoes okay
783860 hey didnt nicollette work with aaron a few times like 1981 1982
783861 if you could save 4 8 cents a gallon 10 20 years from now would that be worth it
783862 the publics changing energy priorities are most evident in the growing percentage that views increased energy exploration as a more important priority for energy policy than increased conservation and regulation
783863 1 is the basic information 38 gbbl existing offshore reserves true
783864 2 if so why do they want access to additional offshore reserves
783865 assuming say us put a million bpd onto the market what is stopping saudi arabia from taking a million bpd off the market and effectively eliminating any price benefit
783866 bottom line we arent talking about a globally significant amount of oil
783867 we cant drill any more because we dont have the equipment to find enough oil for 300 million people
783868 sven the amazing nordic porn star and his midget rosy
783869 their chance of survival on the street is slim intervention and communication are essential to prevent a second attempt and or revengeful action
783870 many of these kids want out of their gangs but rivals wont let them we work as mediators between the gangs communicating truces and getting these kids out and into work or school programs we are happy to say that we have been successful
783871 they help me when difficult situations arise therefore i want to help support their efforts
783872 today represents a milestone in our nations efforts to remedy the ills of our past
783873 all of the action is in services web 2 0 is where the action is
783874 our site is supposed to provide information about our companys products
783875 the site is supposed to effectively convey our brand to our audience
783876 it would take 8 years to pay off the 10 000 premium of an electric system driving 40 miles a day and saving 8 cents per mile gott says which is longer than most people want to own a car
783877 but people buy these things to make an environmental statement
783878 ik vind het prima als we rennen maar we hebben liever niet dat de tegenstander ook rent
783879 in de laatste vijf minuten zakten we weer wat weg denk ik we moeten er op blijven letten
783880 ik probeerde hem niet na te doen hoor zei pierce
783881 when i came down i thought i felt a pop i thought i tore it i couldnt move
783882 i see myself as a casualty of a perfect storm
783883 the people sleeping at the parking lot are very friendly theyre just like me they come from normal everyday homes i think a lot of people in this country dont realise that they too are a couple of pay cheques away from destitution
783884 now find some customers and we will talk about funding
783885 sure we might be able to use that if you get into production
783886 not good enough we meant customers actually giving you money and have started receiving products
783887 harness americas abundant wind energy to replace natural gas power generation and use natural gas for transportation to stop shipping trillions of dollars overseas
783888 being ready is not what matters what matters is winning after you get there
783889 goddam it youll never get the purple heart hiding in a foxhole follow me
783890 come on you sons of bitches do you want to live forever
783891 i cant say enough about the two marine divisions if i use words like brilliant it would really be an under description of the absolutely superb job they did in breaching the so called impenetrable barrier absolutely superb operation a textbook and i think itll be studied for many many years to come as the way to do it
783892 i have just returned from visiting the marines at the front and there is not a finer fighting organization in the world
783893 casualties many percentage of dead not known combat efficiency we are winning
783894 hard pressed on my right my center is yielding impossible to maneuver situation excellent i am attacking
783895 the more marines i have around the better i like it
783896 i want you boys to hurry up and whip these germans so we can get out to the pacific to kick the s t out of the purple pissing japanese before the godda ed marines get all the credit
783897 people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
783898 sometimes it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge hammer
783899 a ship without marines is like a garment without buttons
783900 the marines have landed and have the situation well in hand
783901 casualties many percentage of dead not known combat efficiency we are winning
783902 i can never again see a united states marine without experiencing a feeling of reverence
783903 the raising of that flag on suribachi means a marine corps for the next 500 years
783904 come on you sons of b do you want to live forever
783905 were not retreating hell were just attacking in a different direction
783906 i have just returned from visiting the marines at the front and there is not a finer fighting organization in the world
783907 so theyve got us surrounded good now we can fire in any direction those b ds wont get away this time
783908 we have two companies of marines running all over this island and thousands of army troops doing nothing
783909 the safest place in korea was right behind a platoon of marines lord how they could fight
783910 panic sweeps my men when they are facing the american marines
783911 our country wont go on forever if we stay soft as we are now there wont be any america because some foreign soldier will invade us and take our women and breed a hardier race
783912 some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference the marines dont have that problem
783913 there are only two kinds of people that understand marines marines and those who have met them in battle everyone else has a second hand opinion
783914 the bond between master and student i failed you obi wan in that i took so much joy in our relationship that i could not teach you that even things of great delight may lead us astray
783915 i cannot deny that it is good to see you again and i sense that you are equally glad to see me again
783916 how that gladness is a shadow of greed and how to let that go
783917 i will master but first i will exist in this moment
783918 you have no idea how hard it is for a girl to quit smoking
783919 all right youve seen my ass i guess you can come in now
783920 no buts about it i wouldnt have said that if i didnt think you were cute
783921 so good to see that you are prompt nine oclock on the button
783922 mr tollison was my father you can call me zane
783923 we are both businessmen i shant beat around the bush simply put clearwater wants to buy your name
783924 as i indicated when i spoke to you yesterday we are in the process of pulling together a study to refute the accusations of the anti smoking coalitions although we certainly value your insights there is really very little we expect you to do we already know what we want to find and except for going through the motions of the actual ten day investigation our people have basically completed the final report
783925 we did feel that it was important for you to actually be here while we conduct the study to lend a touch of credence to the work
783926 we shant detain you once weve gathered our data but please feel free to stay at clearwater to dot and cross whatever is and ts you feel are necessary to put the finishing touches to the report after all the findings are going to be released by tollison consulting
783927 we had hoped we could attract your services and took the liberty of having our legal people draft a preliminary agreement
783928 a good faith advance in the amount of 1 15 million dollars shall be deposited to your account upon signing the contract with the balance being paid in ten equal installments of 1 15 million dollars each day for the duration of the study the total for your services will be 12 65 million dollars
783929 the future of the entire tobacco industry depends on the timely release of these findings we shant tolerate any mishaps the agreement provides a rather stiff penalty of 2 3 million dollars per day should you fail to see the job through
783930 i prefer not to elaborate but please understand this would be the least of your concerns if the details of your actual role in the investigation should ever chance to leave this room
783931 the government can now put you in an offshore prison without trial or charges just because they decide they dont like you or your opinions no thats just for terrorists

783936 the fact is this nation was never one that tied itself to the beliefs of christianity or any other religion
783937 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
783938 you have no right to ask the government to take away the rights of a group of people who dont fit your moral code
783939 we thomas jefferson ben franklin and john adams in particular
783940 also the pursuit of happiness could apply to the people around you they just want to go to an event designed to bring children to they have the right to not have to shield junior from what they see as unnatural and wrong in a family setting
783941 do you really believe that the founding fathers could have been referring to anyone other than god i think not to interpret this in any other way is ignorant of history

783947 we have an aging white america they are dying we have got to eliminate the gringo and what i mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst we have got to kill him the border remains a military zone we remain a hunted people now you think you have a destiny to fulfill in the land that historically has been ours for forty thousand years and were a new mestizo nation and they want us to discuss civil rights civil rights what law made by white men to oppress all of us of color female and male this is our homeland we cannot we will not and we must not be made illegal in our own homeland we are not immigrants that came from another country to another country we are migrants free to travel the length and breadth of the americas because we belong here we are millions we just have to survive we have an aging white america they are not making babies they are dying its a matter of time the explosion is in our population
783948 how are mexican immigrants of today different from mexican immigrants of decades ago
783949 to the gringos in the audience i have one final message to convey up yours baby
783950 there are changing political times where our basic foundations and programs are being attacked illegal and legal immigration are being unfairly attacked we have to band together and that means latinos in florida cuban americans mexican americans puerto ricans south americans we have to network better we have to be more politically minded we have to put aside party and think of ourselves as latinos as hispanics more than we have in the past
783951 we have 27 centers now throughout lausd every one of them has trained people clerks to take the fingerprints each one has the camera that special camera we have the application forms and ill tell you what weve done with i n s now were even doing the testing that usually people had to go to ins to take and pretty soon hopefully well do the final interviews in our schools incidentally i started this very quietly because there are those that if they knew that we were creating a whole new cadre of brand new citizens it would have tremendous political impact we will change the political panorama not only of l a but l a county and the state and we do that weve changed the panorama of the nation im proud to stand here and tell you that in those close to three years we have processed a little over 78 000 brand new citizens that is the largest citizenship program in the entire nation

783974 i was the one who hurt him and it wont happen again
783975 fine ill wait for you to realize you love me just as much as him
783976 i mean i cant keep pretending that if i ignore his feelings theyll go away but when he talks that way and looks at me like that i cant ignore it any longer
783977 i dont know how to convince him that this is the best way but were leaving tomorrow

783989 throughout our history we have grown on the assumption that energy costs would be low now that those assumptions are shifting it changes assumptions about housing cars and how cities grow push prices up fast enough and it would be the urban planning equivalent of an earthquake
783990 it will be harder to ignore if there is a working model per the usual policy of the patent office
783991 a casimir cavity refers to any region in which electromagnetic modes are suppressed or restricted when atoms enter into suitable micro casimir cavities a decrease in the orbital energies of electrons in atoms will thus occur
783992 essentially when you restrict a wave function in 1 3 dimensions allowed density of states changes
783993 within the context of sed theory it is predicted that the electron energy levels in atoms are determined by a balance of larmor radiation vs absorption of radiative energy from the electromagnetic quantum vacuum by suppressing electromagnetic quantum vacuum energy at appropriate frequencies a change may be effected in the electron energy levels which will result in the emission or release of energy
783994 say you had two magnets you can extract energy from the attractive force exactly once then you have to invest at least that much energy to pull the two magnets apart
783995 government officials cannot simply take tax dollars from the public give those tax dollars to ethanol blenders and then have ethanol supporters tell the public that ethanol is saving them money with cheaper fuel as though the subsidy never existed
783996 although missourians may pay nominally less for gasoline at the pump after the e 10 mandate these savings will not reflect the actual cost missourians would pay in complying with new ethanol fuel standards
783997 ethanol subsidies are not free money they are simply a wealth transfer from one taxpayer to another

784000 in the face of high wheat amp corn prices are poorer people turning to rice are the rice farmers of the american south west turning acreage over to more profitable wheat
784001 common sense tells you that when you divert 30 or so of a crop into a new use prices on the other 70 have to go up
784002 when you start to factor in real world complications like countries beginning to hoard rice and cut exports and the fact that there have been poor harvests in both canada and australia then you realize theres a bit more to the story
784003 non grain crops that dont compete with corn have also seen higher input costs yet they havent seen the same sort of higher output price why
784004 only that hasnt happened ethanol producers end up with damned near as much feed per bushel as non producers do better quality feed at that

784030 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the mans becoming in very fact an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag and this excludes the red flag which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people

784167 come saree we must make a quick stop at my house before we go
784168 what do you think this is going to be i dont need a weapon and you with that sword have you gone mad
784169 from that letter i can tell this man is a fool he has never dealt with secrets nor with conspiracies first off he tries to be secretive in a letter but comes off sounding blatantly suspicious secondly he asks you to meet him at a bar which tells me the man is prone to drink and therefore prone to a lose tongue so what pry tell happens when a man who is doing something new something he has never done before mixes himself with drink he tells everyone so by these facts alone it tells me we must go in prepared i only wish father had told you what it is he has got himself mixed in so i know the level of danger we are dealing with so i must assume we are dealing with a maximum level of threat understand

784220 as a result singapores inbound travel particularly in the last quarter has been affected this slowdown in the tourism sectors growth may potentially continue into the next few months
784221 while the sectors performance may ease now businesses should take the opportunity to regroup rethink and prepare for the coming surge of visitors expected in 2010

784227 statistics continue to show that vietnam has massive tourism and business traveller appeal but a shortage of hotels that possess warm hearted hospitality and quality our signature

784231 to help support them in this task they are reducing processing costs through increased usage of online booking tools they are enhancing policy communication to travellers and they are enforcing the use of preferred suppliers and the preferred agency
784232 we updated the structure and focus of the survey to reflect the profile of our client base

784239 we are deeply honoured that hrh princess ubolrat rachakanya who is widely recognized for her dedication to promoting the thai tourism industry has agreed to grace our grand opening
784240 we believe that that our strategy of expanding our hotel portfolio in asia in 2008 and beyond is the right one as demand for hotel accommodation is strong and is expected to rise
784241 the phuket property is also m amp cs first resort property in east asia and this allows us more options to deliver the kind of service the more discerning traveller expects
784242 with strong domestic demand an increasing affinity for global brands and international inbound travel on the rise our opportunity in china is perhaps unsurpassed anywhere in the world
784243 whats more by 2020 china will generate over 100 million outbound trips a year more than triple its current output making it one of the largest origins of outbound travel in the world as the chinese travel abroad they look for brands they know and therefore starwoods development in china today has significant implications for our hotels worldwide
784244 we expect healthy expansion as we launch aloft throughout china and continue to expand our established upper upscale and luxury brands in various chinese cities where we are currently under penetrated
784245 starwood continues to win many new hotel projects in china and this is largely due to the confidence the development community has in our lifestyle brands noted innovations and consistently strong delivery of results in the region
784246 darwin will now be the strategic pivot for the growth of our asian strategy with our short haul fleet of a320 aircraft
784247 the hub will build connections between australia and asia via darwin providing new direct access to more asian centres and greater access to jetstars growing networks in singapore and vietnam
784248 in september we commence the next stage in our darwin asia strategy with the commencement of services to vietnam
784249 we are looking at a range of destinations within a four to five hour flying range of darwin
784250 over the next few years as the hub build momentum jetstar will be hiring a number of direct staff but the potential indirect impact to tourism and industry opportunities and the boost to jobs cannot be underestimated
784251 with the support of the government the airport and local industry we can potentially re position darwin as a strategic transport hub into near asia this then provides the opportunity for the city to sell its strategic geographic location to companies and industries trying to build complementary industry and operations in darwin to benefit both south east asia and australia
784252 challenges include the need to have a competitive charging regime at darwin airport we continue to work cooperatively with the airport to realise this outcome

784255 last financial year was extremely positive for both our airports and the results speak for themselves
784256 we have worked closely with all our airline partners to ensure that our airports continue to receive sufficient capacity to cater for the increased demand
784257 the opportunity for darwin to become a stopover destination has never been greater it is vital that the tourism industry take this opportunity as this would also help smooth out the peaks and troughs that exist in this market
784258 in light of a tougher operating environment in the second half of the year we are pleased with the results at our airports the growth at darwin airport has been underpinned by increased business activity which generates year round and higher yielding traffic to our airline partners

784274 one of the great revelations about this recording of j s bachs partita no 2 in d minor bwv 1004 chorales ciaccona for solo violin and four voices is how it supports the notion that it was popular during the baroque era to use the medium of numbers to create riddles and hidden messages within a musical text because of extensive research into the work of bach particularly by dr helga thoene of the university of d sseldorf it is known that he used these methods quite regularly to reference his own name and to underscore his spiritual beliefs by creating a veritable doxological theology by coding it deeply within his sacred works reading works that were entirely instrumental such as the six sonatas and partitas for solo violin was a fruit of thoenes discovery she found inside the ciaccona from the partita in d minor 1004 bmv a kind of epitaph for maria barbara bach a series of chorale quotes based on the symbolism of numerical patterns interpreted by means of using the gematria hebrew numerology violinist christoph poppen together with ecms manfred eicher and the hilliard ensemble have devised a program that would make the hidden chorales audible using the research of dr thoene on the ciaccona which was published in 1994 the collaborators have created one of the most stunning works of baroque interpretation in the history of recorded music this is a recording that more than any in memory or perhaps any performance known widely has made the thoughts of the composer audible to listeners the five movements of the partite no 2 are linked together by various chorales on the album morimur so the partita is played in its entirety

784355 i once had a client who was hiring for a position that while otherwise desirable required that the employee work in a warehouse away from the companys main offices and other colleagues
784356 knowing that this workspace would be undesirable to most applicants the client refused to disclose it to interviewees to him it was an innocuous omission but it resulted in his new employee becoming disgruntled and quitting after only a few weeks on the job
784357 you expect a job applicant to present himself honestly employees deserve the same respect being deceptive about an open position or about your company is just as bad as an applicant lying on a resume
784358 are calibrated to cause the best kind of trouble the trouble that forces us to ask how we can make the world a better place
784359 the simple definitions of leadership are so elusive that none really covers it
784360 its almost metaphysical we define things i think to better understand them but in the case of leadership we try to define the subject in order to learn how to become better leaders im not sure that it works that way if only because the qualities of leadership are so amorphous as to defy easy access to it
784361 maybe its time to stop whining about the staffing crisis and start talking about realistic ways to solve it
784362 make it two hey there are something else pointing at the other corner of the counter i will go check it out
784363 i will show you first the younger vines which we use for finca dofi then i will show you the 75 year old vines on the other side of the hill which are for lermita
784364 all my vines are north east facing this is very important all other facings will be too hot with the crunching sun and no good for the vines the mediterranean sea is on the east the mountain is in the north these are ideal conditions for vine growing to fully benefit from the constant warm sea breeze feeling and hugging the sea breeze himself with his arms isnt it nice
784365 but it should not be too humid or fungus will start to grow on the buddy green grapes
784366 we use and spray mainly sulfur on the vines the leaves and grapes to prevent fungus and other pests
784367 these have to be removed i have 20 workers working and giving tender care to the vines all manual works look at the vines arent they beautiful look how green and glossy the leaves are look at the tiny luscious grapes budding jade green very good a lot of manual hard work has gone into it no shortcuts
784368 the vines have to be manually tied in this manner in order for the mules we saw two and two workers taking break under the shade alvaro waved and greeted them to pass through to cultivate the soils and not to damage the vines a lot of manual works
784369 but they looked perfectly good to me why did you do that
784370 the vines need to compete this way the wines will automatically be richer with more depth you know a lot of knowledge and experience go into making good wine no compromise
784371 i have planted them some 1 to 2 years ago with the seeds of the 75 year old lermita vines im lucky to be able to purchase some additional plots of land for this work look at them arent they growing beautifully they will grow up fine and good for future generations of palacios wine makers
784372 its after the name of a chapel there it is pointing to the small chapel atop the hill its right next to lermita vineyard you know theres a nun living in it
784373 dont know yet there were quite a bit of rains in may its drier now i hope it will stay this way the next few months will be very important
784374 see the soil is being worked on and loosened this way it helps the moisture in the soil from the rain water to evaporate which is good for the vines
784375 look at the soil the schist they are special and unique here see how loose they are they contain these slates
784376 the slate stores the heat radiated by the sun besides reflecting its light here the slates are a bit greener and different from those at the finca dofi vineyards which are browner this is because they contain more iron and therefore are naturally cooler this gives rise to different characters to the wines the soil is loose and drains water well the water can be stored very deep in the soil as deep as 10m the roots of these 75 year old vines will grow to this depth and spread
784377 the roots of the vines have to negotiate through these rocks can you imagine it well all these conditions stress the vines it is good for the vines and wine this is what makes lermita special
784378 you know lermita vines and the grapes have reached the level of consistency that since 2006 theres no longer any need to add anymore cabernet sauvignon previously about 5 it will be 100 garnacha
784379 2 5ha and gives about 6 000 bottles a year some years less e g 2005
784380 do you spend most of your time here in priorat
784381 50 50 i also spend some time in rioja do you know my family many generations has been working on rioja wines the remondo i also work with my cousin ricardo on a bit of other biodynamic wines
784382 here he is they have arrived let me introduce you to him
784383 oh no its too far and will be too late by the time you reach there all will be closed nothing to eat i recommend you a restaurant which is just opposite in the village across the road can you see the tree lining road and the building with arches there it is the chef is a half japanese and half brazilian try it very good
784384 is it japanese food emm we would prefer non asian food
784385 no its spanish very spanish even catalonian its very good you should try it the restaurant is called
784386 irreductibles i have heard of it its famous oh its just here ok we will go try it thanks for the recommendation
784387 yes please come in and where would you like to sit
784388 we propose a three course menu the starter will be a sardine the main course will be a beef tartare and will end with desert is this ok with you
784389 he singled out that the wine was actually called fa112 a tiny blue circle on the wine label
784390 he makes very good wine lermita but very expensive you should try clos erasmus much cheaper but also a very good wine parker has given it once 100 points you know probably less than 100euros
784391 you have to try this creamy desert quickly or it will topple in no time
784392 a passion for theoretical physics and all that that entails
784393 what this all tells me is that there is far too much controversy over the authorship and credibility of these books even among christians to treat them as evidentiary
784394 you do not follow paul or apollos another church planter you follow jesus
784395 i believe the numbers work out in such a way that ufos as interstellar vehicles is extremely unlikely but i think it is an equally bad mistake to say that interstellar space flight is impossible
784396 therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
784397 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself
784398 a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers
784399 which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers
784400 i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people
784401 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you
784402 it is unfortunate that the important doctrine of separation has been misunderstood and abused in recent years for it is an essential truth some sincerely zealous christians have turned separation into isolation until their fellowship has become so narrow that they cannot even get along with themselves in reaction to this extreme position other believers have torn down all the walls and will fellowship with anybody regardless of what he believes or how he lives while we applaud their desire to practice christian love we want to remind them that even christian love must exercise discernment phil 1 9 11 paul presented three arguments to try to convince these believers that they must separate themselves from that which is contrary to gods will
784403 jeff may not realize it yet but when he is helping another he is ministering to jesus
784404 man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
784405 if loving you is wrong i dont want to be right
784406 but dad i thought yould be happy that we helped out
784407 the bible is all about good deeds amp kindness to all
784408 the bible is all about righteousness morality amp the impending judgment of the unredeemed
784409 i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people
784410 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you
784411 my point once again being good works doesnt justify a person before god
784412 i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people
784413 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you
784414 if christians dont accept the bible what it says what is the whole point
784415 i accept the bible in full and that guy doesnt
784416 you have no excuse before god you will be held more accountable than the poor for instance african bush man who never heard the truth you have heard the truth and willfully deny it
784417 the bible is all about good deeds amp kindness to all
784418 the bible is all about righteousness morality amp the impending judgment of the unredeemed
784419 these things shall be and what shall be the signs of thy coming
784420 come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
784421 so when non christians torment christians or refuse to help needy individuals who are professing christians its like theyre tormenting and rejecting jesus because we are
784422 whats right for me may not be right for you because i interpret the scriptures differently
784423 and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works
784424 im really thinking theres not too many more ways this can be interpreted
784425 why that would just be unloving for him to make us try and figure out which is right in order to please him or make sure that were obeying him
784426 even though there have been debates for thousands of years on the meanings of these texts i kate have them figured out and god is unloving if i kate am not correct
784427 we are now sweating over the translation of the prophets into german
784428 ok lord what are you saying what do i need to learn here
784429 why would you put your faith in something so flimsy
784430 for false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great miraculous signs and wonders so as to deceive if possible even gods chosen ones
784431 love experience joy and sadness seek answers to hard questions

784435 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
784436 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
784437 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
784438 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
784439 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive

784441 rain grew up as a poor kid deprived of many things in childhood things that people take it for granted like food rain had been unemployed starved for days no money even to pay for his mothers injections to survive if you really have to compare rain with shiwon what shiwon has accomplished so far with his fortunate up bringing including his language skills is really nothing other than ordinary compared to what rain has achieved
784442 siwon is only good in english because he came from a rich family unlike rain
784443 i have to give siwon his props his english is good and he has a hot body
784444 when mr stewart tried to joke about mr obama changing his position on campaign finance he met with such obvious resistance
784445 gumbinger was quoted in stephenss story as saying that obama

784466 it was a weird dream i am in bed with nueng her face is nestled into my shoulder and her arm is draped over my chest she looks like a sleeping angel mine my angel then i hear it it sounds like like no it cant be it sounds like the voice of my ex girlfriend shes coming up the stairs calling out to me and i realize that this is not a dream
784467 after taking months to recover from a brutal heartbreak out of nowhere the ex returns she hands me a belated christmas gift a small stuffed toy wraps her arms around me buries her head into my shoulder and says i love you uncomfortably i accepted her gift and returned her embrace all the while thinking of the other woman hiding in my bedroom

784471 this is a typically superfluous response from barack obama like most celebrities he reacts to fair criticism with a mix of fussiness and hysteria
784472 premeditated murder of male detainees of apparent middle eastern descent whose names are unknown and in order to effect the object of the conspiracy ssg jess c cunningham and members of his unit took the male detainees to a canal and members of his unit did shoot the male detainees with firearms

784477 i like gay people fine so long as all they do is decorate my house and dont shove things down my throat
784478 why cant they just leave me alone with their demands for equality and justice huh their stupid humanity is pissing me off
784479 our country is going to hell in a hand basket and no one even seems to care if good people dont start standing up for their beliefs then they will get what they allowed to happen to them happens this is a shame george washington must be turning over in his grave the other sad part is that many current immigrants dont even know who i am talking about
784480 and another thing while were on the topic i also hate brown people
784481 the list that counts is the list where we paid for services and that list was provided to you
784482 oldman said in an interview with the associated press quoting the magazines review of
784483 you know what thats the best review ive ever had ill put that on my tombstone makes virtue look exciting thats pretty good
784484 darth vader in his college age paisley and coffee house days
784485 johns been a celebrity ever since he was shot down
784486 whatever that means and i recall ronald reagan and george h w bush going overseas and all those waving american flags
784487 for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness
784488 there is legitimate mockery of a political campaign now and it isnt at obamas for mccains sake this tomfoolery needs to stop
784489 i was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what sen mccain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past
784490 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
784491 how many of you out there would like a president who has trouble finding his own ass without a map
784492 one of the most essential human activities communicating and degrades it to nothing more than electronic poo flinging
784493 i dunno bob she seems smart but did you notice those tiny boobs i think shes gay im voting for the guy
784494 well that certainly didnt take long the candidate john mccain who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
784495 look we hate this guy he might be smart and helpful and god forbid give some of our oil money to poor people by taxing the shit out of us unfortunately hes black so we cant openly beat the shit out of him we cant get some guys who served with him in vietnam to say evil shit against him we cant even get some secretary who looks like her face caught fire and someone put it out with a track shoe to say the guy was playing grab ass with her were totally screwed
784496 i just learned how to use the interwebs and now my fingers are all cramped up
784497 thats not the kind of change we need hee hee

784501 hi and welcome this is my life my personal observations and experiences living and working in the netherlands and my travel journeys about art amp architecture history and culture all over europe asia and around the world come in and come away with me
784502 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
784503 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
784504 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
784505 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
784506 this is to inform you that our office will announce today that commissioner goodell will reinstate brett favre to the green bay packers active roster effective at noon on monday august 4
784507 as a redskins fan let me say that today was about as good as it gets
784508 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
784509 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
784510 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
784511 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
784512 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
784513 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
784514 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
784515 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
784516 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
784517 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
784518 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
784519 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
784520 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
784521 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
784522 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
784523 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
784524 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
784525 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
784526 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
784527 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
784528 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
784529 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
784530 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
784531 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
784532 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
784533 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
784534 who are open to doing something on the production side
784535 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
784536 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
784537 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

784561 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
784562 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
784563 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
784564 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
784565 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
784566 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
784567 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
784568 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
784569 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
784570 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
784571 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
784572 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
784573 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
784574 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
784575 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
784576 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
784577 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
784578 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
784579 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
784580 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
784581 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
784582 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
784583 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
784584 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
784585 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
784586 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
784587 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
784588 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
784589 first there were only two protagonists they only had eyes for each other asafa powell and tyson gay held the races and their results between them however the emergence of usain bolt has put a cat amongst the mice psychologically everyone is running scared
784590 theres still something thrilling and timeless about the sheer athletic simplicity of weightlifting that renders it so watchable man sees weight man picks up weight man picks up heaviest weight man wins gold
784591 an athlete can be subjected to a battery of invasive and one assumes humiliating tests simply because someone dislikes the look of her
784592 men get more basic advice including not sporting pyjamas in public not going out with a bare chest and not rolling up their trouser legs
784593 rules are also already in place to try to control taxi drivers bad breath they have been ordered to cut down on their garlic consumption and watch what they eat for breakfast
784594 its a fundamental law of nature all things gravitate toward total chaos
784595 xmega board be it success or failure itll be the challenge of learning how to consistently work with that fine a pitch at home that interest me
784596 then the one i currently have but even that is in the works
784597 to the total period of one complete cycle of a periodic square waveform
784598 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
784599 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
784600 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
784601 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
784602 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
784603 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
784604 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
784605 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
784606 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
784607 when your cell phone is ringing off the hook the blackberry is buzzing and the e mails are piling up do you ever just want to run away from technology
784608 mccain also insisted the technology exists to quickly bring oil produced offshore to market
784609 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
784610 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
784611 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
784612 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
784613 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
784614 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
784615 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
784616 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
784617 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
784618 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
784619 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
784620 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
784621 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
784622 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
784623 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
784624 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
784625 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
784626 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
784627 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
784628 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
784629 we are really at the situation where all parties are agreed that edf would be the best purchaser of be it is the best and most straightforward way of getting the nuclear new build that we are looking for
784630 you dont stand back totally when you have a 36 per cent stake
784631 i really like living here and the staff are great they even change my light bulbs for me when they burn out as i cannot get up on a step ladder anymore i really appreciate them all
784632 the leasing manager is excellent at customer service and she really seems to care about the residents and the community
784633 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
784634 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
784635 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal
784636 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
784637 we said prayers for them both at services this morning at the little country church where they married and at our other church in alltwen
784638 i paid a eulogy to catherine who i have known since she was a young girl in a welsh school
784639 i paid tribute to her personality her good life and of course such a talented person and respected by all who knew her
784640 we also sang a hymn which catherine would have sung at ysgol gyfun ystalyfera her school which talks about turning night into day
784641 si no somos corresponsables del pasado tampoco tendremos derecho a reclamarnos leg timos propietarios del futuro
784642 i was stalking another woman i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention
784643 i never refused to give evidence my legal team advised that it would be inappropriate
784644 i wont follow women any more i know its wrong
784645 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
784646 if i could go back in time and change that i would
784647 i prayed that something would happen to get me out
784648 they used to call me scum and spit in my tea i kept my head down and never spoke to anyone
784649 people serving long sentences are able to adjust slowly to the idea of freedom but the victim of a miscarriage of justice case is just suddenly out on the street without any preparation
784650 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
784651 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
784652 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
784653 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
784654 ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy and a few setbacks
784655 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some people backing brown and others trying to knife him
784656 we have a government in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges we cant go on like this for another 18 months we need a general election sooner rather than later
784657 become more obsessed with the leadership than with running the country
784658 its not the sort of thing that happens if you are a genuinely strong leader
784659 its easy to say this in hindsight but the subtext of the story of last summer shows where the problems lay
784660 his popularity was based on surprise that he had been able to make quick decisions in crises but the brown bounce was not nearly as good in polling terms as it was for other leaders
784661 what happened since particularly with bottling the election in october is that his weaknesses have come to the fore he takes too long to make a decision even longer to unmake a bad one such as scrapping the 10p tax band and he is a poor communicator
784662 you have to wonder why it took so long for the government to accept that hikes in fuel tax were unacceptable and werent going to happen they ended up being cancelled in by elections and it looked like his hand had been forced
784663 100 per cent supportive of gordon brown and the government
784664 junked the tb tony blair policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
784665 a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
784666 we really need this election to concentrate on the battle of ideas and issues
784667 if we start this back stabbing we will tear the party apart
784668 its a done deal its kevin pietersen were not even accepting any bets for him if we did theyd be about 1 100
784669 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest its a job ive loved for five years and ive put my heart and soul into it my mind told me to pack it in and i just felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career
784670 last and not least i want to thank my family
784671 i spoke to my dad this morning and he said you can walk away a proud lad because youve given everything and that is all i ever asked you to do now im back in the ranks of the other players and i need to score runs to get back in the team
784672 ive not been scoring runs and that is because my mind hasnt been fresh there have been plenty of distractions as is the case with the captaincy over five years its taken its toll
784673 it is a total coincidence i made up my mind on thursday
784674 im disappointed for michael because hes been an excellent captain of his country and like paul collingwood he was probably one innings away from resurrecting his form
784675 i think the pressure from outside built up but he was well respected by all the players and i think he should have waited until after this winters tour of india
784676 im disappointed for him because i know how much it means to him but i dont think his international career is over by any means
784677 he may not have scored that many runs this season but his quality has been very evident i hope he can clear his head come back and get loads of runs hes got to have that desire to get back though
784678 i think that it is very dangerous for the government to get involved in funding documentaries that deal with politically controversial topics such as this one on police community support officers
784679 it may be that there is sometimes a need for the government to make information films on other less controversial issues but it is crucial that these are clearly labelled as government backed projects
784680 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency the home office does not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
784681 public information films used to state clearly at the beginning exactly what they were and i think if ministers are going to fund documentaries they must take a similar approach
784682 its about moving away from the mega venues which the fringe seems to have got further and further into every year
784683 our audiences can go back to the old days of the fringe where people could see three shows on a night without it costing an arm and a leg
784684 i absolutely applaud the growth of the free fringe but theres a place for that alongside the bigger scale venues and more expensive shows i bet you the majority of people coming to the fringe will do both thats part of the joy of the fringe
784685 the number of bureaucrats has been increasing twice as fast as the number of nurses under labour meaning that hard working frontline staff arent given the resources to cope with major problems like superbugs
784686 rather than tackle these serious issues the response is now another pointless rebranding exercise taxpayers money should be spent on doctors not spin doctors
784687 this is outrageous and just the tip of the iceberg
784688 for the pct to be doing this and the government to be suggesting this is just nonsense why on earth would anyone think this is money well spent
784689 as front line commissioners of patient care that tailors services to meet the needs of their local population to improve quality and choice
784690 i couldnt bear to look at myself in the mirror couldnt stand the sound of my voice i just couldnt take tracey emin any more i just hope that visitors will be able to cut themselves off a bit from the tracey thing
784691 one bloke told me my work made him feel embarrassed at being a man
784692 there is no genre of painting with which i would rather be associated less
784693 why is it that visual studio cannot load a symbol file for a binary that was built with the exact same set of source files
784694 surely if i build a component twice consecutively with no changes to source in between i certainly will end up with two identical copies of that component right
784695 because both the visual studio and your sanity depends on it
784696 individuals just an amorphous group that is supposed to be specifically repugnant

784732 is there any way to step into a function without having to bother stepping into all the properties that might have to be executed as parameters before getting to what im really interested in

784735 we did the first jump at kirra just to see if he liked it because if he didnt i wouldnt pursue it
784736 i said to myself if he doesnt like it hes not doing it again but he loved it
784737 it was all fine though and when we landed he just got his ball and ran around in circles
784738 he was a normal happy dog and the jump didnt seem to scare him
784739 ive actually spoken to tv vet dr harry cooper many years ago when a team member was jumping with a dog
784740 someone had complained to the rspca about it so we contacted him to do a story on it and he said there was no issue as far as cruelty to animals
784741 we wanted to give them something more than just a tandem dive with two people
784742 that would have just been the same old thing but when you land with a dog well thats certainly something a bit special
784743 its exactly the same as a tandem skydive with people
784744 hes attached to me and he cant get out of it
784745 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
784746 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward
784747 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have a high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth

784749 two fbi agents walked into a public library in maryland without a warrant and
784750 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
784751 should the librarian have done this without requiring a warrant regardless of the impressions that they had
784752 the feds can go screw themselves they cant demand what does not exist
784753 without a court order neither the fbi nor local law enforcement has authority to compel cooperation with an investigation or require answers to questions other than the name and address of the person speaking to the agent or officer if the agent or officer persists or makes an appeal to patriotism the library director should explain that as good citizens the library staff will not respond to informal requests for confidential information in conformity with professional ethics first amendment freedoms and state law if the agent or officer presents a search warrant or other judicial process the library director should immediately call the librarys counsel and ask for assistance

784767 the industry standard reports that dell is trying to trademark the term cloud computing the phrase entered the tech lexicon years ago but dells application serial number 77139082 was made in early 2007 to the us patent and trademark office apparently in connection with data center products and services that it was promoting around that time a quick search of google news indicates that dell itself did not use the term in press releases or discussions with indexed english language media sources from 1996 to 2006 dell is not the first company to attempt to trademark this term the standard notes that netcentric a company that provided carrier class internet fax technology also gave it a shot in the late 1990s but was rejected

784820 its totally prohibited to give unlimited contributions to political parties its totally prohibited for a corporation or a union to just go right into its treasury and give money to political parties yet under an exemption that was created by the federal election commission which essentially is made up of representatives of the two major parties all of this money can be given if its given through a host committee under the pretense that its merely to promote the convention city
784821 in return for this money the parties through the host committees offer access to top politicians to the president the future president vice president cabinet officials senators congressmen they promise these companies who are giving that they will be able to not only get close to these people by hosting receptions by access to vip areas but theyll actually have meetings with them
784822 lavish conventions with million dollar podiums fancy skyboxes and broadway production teams are not necessary to the democratic process
784823 congress should pass a law that says no more soft money for these conventions no corporate treasury union treasury no unlimited individual money instead the discard this host committee fiction can go out there and ask people to help the convention but with the same limits where theyre asking people to help them normally

784825 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest u s support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and cannot cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
784826 torture massacres disappearances and killings of noncombatants are widespread and collusion between the armed forces and paramilitary groups continues to this day in 2006 u s assistance to colombia amounted to an estimated 728 million approximately 80 percent of which was military and police assistance
784827 supplied directly or through contractors troop transportation planning facilities and fuel to colombian military aircraft including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb
784828 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
784829 part of the reason is that the people who write about global warming for most newspapers and tv are not the same people as those who tend to cover weather in general the media is covering this as all sort of unconnected events just regular weather maybe gone a little wacky but in fact the scientific community has predicted for more than two decades now that as we pour more heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the planet will heat up and that would redistribute water if you heat up the planet you evaporate more water and areas that are wetter will tend to see more intense rainfall and deluges and earlier snowmelts and all that will lead to flooding so what were seeing is exactly what scientists have been telling us would happen because of human emissions
784830 not even a few weeks before this all happened we were in the middle of doing a climate change series thats going to run over the year we had two page graphic talking about the different things that would happen in iowa as a result of climate change and pointing out that you would expect more torrential rains what has happened here is consistent with many scientists view of what global warming will mean in the midwest
784831 if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams american meteorological society shouldnt give them a seal of approval if a meteorologist has an ams seal of approval which is used to confer legitimacy to tv meteorologists then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming
784832 weve got to have a national mission of converting our economy and the example for the world is solar energy 4 billion years of supply it is environmentally benign decentralized makes us energy independent and replaces the exxonmobil peabody coal uranium complex that is why we have got to go for economic political health and safety reasons

784834 our dominant media are ultimately accountable only to corporate boards whose mission is not life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the whole body of our republic but the aggrandizement of corporate executives and shareholders

784840 depressing inability to appreciate that in our land of cultural pluralism there are many who think act and talk differently from the members of this court and who do not share their fragile sensibilities
784841 we were founded on a very basic double standard this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free am i right a group of slave owners who wanted to be free so they killed a lot of white english people in order to continue owning their black african people so they could wipe out the rest of the red indian people and move west and steal the rest of the land from the brown mexican people giving them a place to take off and drop their nuclear weapons on the yellow japanese people you know what the motto of this country ought to be you give us a color well wipe it out
784842 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
784843 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
784844 the nuclear revival that we often hear about is not actually happening it is a very carefully fabricated illusion there are no buyers wall street is not putting a penny of private capital into the industry despite 100 plus percent subsidies
784845 basically we can have as many nuclear plants as congress can force the taxpayers to pay for but you wont get any in a market economy
784846 the first issue to come up for me would be the spread of nuclear weapons which it greatly facilitates if you look at places like iran and north korea how do you think theyre doing it iran claims to be making electricity vital to its development the technology materials equipment skills are applicable to both the president is absolutely right in identifying the spread of nuclear weapons as the gravest threat to our security so its really puzzling to me that hes trying to accelerate that spread every way he can think of its just an awful idea unless youre really interested in making bombs hes really triggered a new mideast arms race by trying to push nuclear power within the region
784847 about as fat a terrorist target as you can imagine it is not necessary to fly a plane into a nuclear plant or storm a plant and take over a control room in order to cause that material to be largely released you can often do it from outside the site boundary with things the terrorists would have readily available
784848 it stays dangerous for a very long time so you have to put it someplace that stays away from people and life and water for a very long time millions of years most likely so far all the places weve looked turned out to be geologically unsuitable including yucca mountain
784849 one of the big reasons we have an oil problem and a climate problem today is we spent our money on the wrong stuff if we had spent it on efficiency and renewables those problems wouldve gone away and we wouldve made trillions of dollars profit on the deal because its so much cheaper to save energy than to supply it

784859 i dont want to contribute anything to that industry i cant fault you for what youre doing i admire what you do but i cant feed that dragon think about dollars as bullets
784860 the long memory is the most radical idea in america that long memory has been taken away from us you havent gotten it in your schools youre not getting it on your television youre being leapfrogged from one crisis to the next mass media contributed to that by taking the great movements that weve been through and trivializing important events no our peoples history is like one long river it flows down from way over there and everything that those people did and everything they lived flows down to me and i can reach down and take out what i need if i have the courage to go out and ask questions
784861 the future i dont know through all of it up and down its the song its always been the song
784862 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
784863 so while it was a terrible mistake for the administration to rely on the erroneous intelligence about wmd and i mean it was catastrophic to our credibility first of all it was an honest error and not a lie but even if you correct it for that error what we found in iraq was a serious wmd threat even though saddam hussein had chosen to not maintain the stockpiles he had put himself in a position where he could have regenerated those stockpiles in three to five weeks
784864 to prove that there is nothing is almost impossible i think that if we had been in iraq for a couple of months more it would have been enough to make it extremely clear to everybody that the chances were real that there were no weapons of mass destruction
784865 i wish to heaven that they had listened a little better to what i had to say if they did listen
784866 it is hard to avoid the impression that almost 20 years after the end of the cold war military calculations still dominate the long term thinking about major global relations terrorism is formally made the chief enemy but precautions are taken against the growing power of china and russia
784867 the idea of giving enriched uranium to the saudis while threatening war with the iranians for enriching uranium is astonishing the idea that the saudis are going to somehow lower the price of oil on the basis of possibly getting nuclear reactors in the future is just almost staggering to think about
784868 then i think its very likely that the chinese who have not ratified will follow if china does it maybe india does if india does pakistan does etc and the treaty would enter into force it would be a great thing if we outlawed any nuclear weapons tests in the future

784871 here i am a republican thinking about nationalizing health care it just went against the grain of everything that i stood for but you have to remember i didnt come to those conclusions with lofty ideals of social justice
784872 youre seeing an ever increasing number of people starting to support a national health program in fact 59 percent of practicing physicians today believe that we need to have a national health program i mean thats unheard of even 10 years ago its amazing to see a new generation of physicians coming up who are disgusted with our current health care system you know were trained to be advocates of patients were trained to save lives were trained to practice medicine and instead what were doing is were practicing wall street economics
784873 i know a lot of people favor it but for many reasons it is difficult to achieve
784874 health care meltdown confronting the myths and fixing our failing system
784875 there are a lot of different types of single payer systems you could have purely socialized medicine thats kind of like what england has the government owns the hospitals the government owns the clinics the government finances all the health care and all the doctors work for the government that is truly socialized medicine as opposed to the canadian system where the financing comes through their medicare program but all the doctors are in private practice
784876 you know this industry is a 2 trillion industry and the profits in the for profit insurance industry are so huge and its so deeply entrenched into wall street but until we move to a single payer system and get rid of the profit motive in financing of health care we will not be able to fix the problems that we have
784877 i think that our current presidential candidates understand that ideally single payer would be the best but they dont have the political will to move that forward their job is to feel which way the wind is blowing our job is to turn that wind
784878 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
784879 obama represents all the promise of america that a biracial man from a broken family can rise and have a strong shot of becoming our next president
784880 im not endorsing anybody our country has elected white males from northern european countries going back now 230 or so years this finally represents that the top position in american government is really open to everyone and i think thats sending a powerful message not only to americans but throughout the world
784881 in justice inside the scandal that rocked the bush administration
784882 is when you send voter information to a group of people that you have reason to believe are no longer there such as military personnel who are overseas such as students at historically black colleges when it comes back as undeliverable the party uses that information to remove that person from the voter rolls claiming they are no longer there it is a reprehensible practice i had never heard of it until after i left office
784883 i hope the media keeps shining the spotlight on groups like the american center for voting rights which has been engaging in this type of voter suppression action especially targeting the elderly people and minorities if you are an american citizen who is not a felon you have the right to vote i would just hope that in swing states like missouri wisconsin new mexico and a handful of other states that the democratic party and the media really keep a lot of pressure on this

784885 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
784886 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals

784898 we are holding this demonstration because we are hungry we need to eat we need to work we are hungry thats all we are hungry
784899 the specter of widespread hunger malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale
784900 hunger is on the march here garbage is carefully sifted for whatever food might be left young babies wail in frustration seeking milk from a mother too anemic to produce it
784901 burning food today so as to serve the mobility of the rich countries is a crime against humanity
784902 the truth of the matter is its in our national interests that our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us
784903 is this a price blip no a food shortage not that either we are in a structural meltdown the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalization we have allowed food to be transformed from something that nourishes people and provides them with secure livelihoods into a commodity for speculation and bargaining
784904 the amount of speculative money in commodities futures was less than 5 billion in 2000 last year it ballooned to roughly 175 billion
784905 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
784906 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
784907 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
784908 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
784909 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
784910 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
784911 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
784912 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
784913 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained

784930 post mission gps tracking in all vehicles will save that much or more
784931 its not our job to help control the client agencys fuel costs if they want to use something like gps they they need to take the initiative
784932 we have a team working with bocog to unblock sites to make it easier for reporters and to remove any concerns that sites are censored
784933 apart from those sites for example which relate to pornography which is common to every country in the world to block and sites which could be considered subversive all other sites should be free to enable all reporters to properly report on the games as they have in previous games
784934 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
784935 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them
784936 rogge said i want to assure you i have always kept you informed and we have not shifted anywhere on this and wouldnt have without your involvement
784937 i said im very pleased to hear that because i had big doubts this week the situation was very bad
784938 rogge said i want to give you an unequivocal assurance that i have not in any way deviated from our position that we require an uncensored internet
784939 i said if that is the case you had better put out a statement pretty quickly he said im here to tell you that theres no deal
784940 he said he was taken aback as much as anybody in the last few days that sites like the bbc deutsche welle amnesty international and so on were blocked
784941 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
784942 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
784943 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
784944 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
784945 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
784946 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
784947 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
784948 the fringe ended up being a lot slower the first time i really putted through the fringe all week the putt just seemed like the right shot at the time
784949 et france 3 travaille avec elle pour la musique de
784950 possibly but i think that most everyone in winnipeg that is driving down i 29 to fargo is well aware of what grand forks has to offer has chosen to drive the additional 75 miles to go to fargo and its very unlikely that seeing putt putt golf or a movie complex or something on the highway would make them change their plans
784951 but the weather during that last week in august sure doesnt last
784952 well youre too young to listen to green day then
784953 ignore that tonight as you slumber three more will die they are your neighbors children not yours
784954 the very same bush administration that defends torture of captives in the so called war on terrorism is using 150 000 u s troops to support a regime in baghdad for which torture assassination and other war crimes are routine
784955 repeated surveys have indicated that a majority of americans support government guaranteed universal health insurance forty percent of physicians support some form of a single payer program so why havent we moved in that direction
784956 both children were victims of chemical weapons the first in halabja killed by a dictator who had no respect for democracy and human rights the second in falluja by us troops assisted by the british carrying the colourful banner of those principles while sprinkling iraqis with white phosphorus and depleted uranium
784957 said he hoped the deal would present a friendly challenge to us oil companies which recently reported record quarterly profits to use their windfall to help poor families survive the winter

784961 i hope our presence at sturbridge village helps people understand how wars were fought in 1776 and have always been fought
784962 understanding the history of mankind helps people understand whats going on in modern times
784963 this is going to be one of the very best revolutionary war encampments in new england
784964 both days saturday and sunday will be full of events theres going to be lots of chances to see lots of action
784965 he enlisted in the continental army and was later captured in the battle of long island to earn his release he took an oath not to fight the british again
784966 whether its history or equipment we want to be as accurate as possible
784967 we want people to ask us questions we love to take any chance to talk about history
784968 became a general eventually retired and returned to his estate
784969 nor was the typical british officer an aristocrat who cared more for his liquor cabinet than his men
784970 by and large the british army was a very capable and tough opponent based on their experience fighting indians they were very well schooled in what wed call today counter insurgency
784971 getting caught in the middle of a civil war that was very unpopular back home
784972 its pretty difficult waging a war in a faraway situation you dont understand
784973 i like the noise i like the boom our cannons were the tomahawk missile of those times
784974 my artillery group is like a family weve been together so long when youre a musket man youre alone so artillery provides the teamwork i enjoy
784975 payment cards both credit cards and debit cards are an increasingly common form of payment to merchants for property and services rendered some merchants fail to report accurately their gross income including income derived from payment card transactions generally compliance increases significantly for amounts that a third party reports to the
784976 third party network transactions that operate in a manner similar to payment card transactions
784977 i have buried 2 million worth of gold coins in the desert as a hedge against the economy collapsing my partner doesnt even know where it is at
784978 if the allows me to file a joint federal income tax form like any other married couple the money is there to pay all they have to do is dig it up i want to pay taxes but not treated as a second class citizen gay marriage is not a state issue as the political candidates mccain and obama claim any more than heterosexual marriage is they need to rescind and make us equal citizens under federal law as it stands now gay married couples are taxed without full representation
784979 marriage between gender neutral couples is legal in california but our union is not recognized by the federal government and we dont get the over 1 000 federal benefits automatically extended to heterosexual couples
784980 how to resist the federal income tax through the dont owe nothin method
784981 youre either a beaver lover or youre not a beaver lover
784982 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
784983 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
784984 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am
784985 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
784986 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will
784987 ahh some me time the kids are sleeping i can now spend time on myself
784988 between everybodys houses theres probably several thousand dollars worth of damage i mean thats crazy
784989 hes bounced back really well hes got a strong mind pev
784990 when i sat down with him and jason it was tough for them because i said opportunities may be scarce
784991 i said it doesnt mean you wont be playing but at times it will be tough mentally for you
784992 but hes rode through that come out the other side and when hes come into the team hes taken his opportunity
784993 hes contributing really well and hes a strong part of our team at the moment all credit to to him
784994 we havent had those discussions thats something for the end of the year
784995 its not just the equation of whether its jason or pev or another senior player this is the last uncompromised draft before gold coast and west sydney teams participate and you must maximise your picks
784996 and the evolution of the game is that there are five or six players that come on to your list every year and five or six that have to leave your list and thats the brutal reality of afl footy
784997 when we sit down for those discussions over the next two to four weeks thats when it will come to fruition
784998 my bodys fine and the head and heart are still in it well see what happens
784999 id love to keep going im trying my best to convince em im right to go next year but whatever happens happens but this might be my last month of footy coming up so ive just got to enjoy it
785000 it was disappointing that a private conversation between the coach and a couple of players ended up being made public jason and i werent really worried about it it was just disappointing it ended up out in the public get the best of foxtel
785001 hes a bit sore but were hopeful hell come up
785002 weve got an eight day break which should help hes had a bit of a headache so well know more in the next few days the shoulder just partly came out
785003 jason porplyzia at the moment is showing enormous courage to play afl footy and to perform with a shoulder that comes in and out
785004 hes not just taking the field and being a number out there he is actually contributing very strongly and doing a great job
785005 he will continue to do what hes doing until he gets to a situation where he and the coaching group believe its unfair to push on
785006 hopefully he can play out to the end of the season whenever that may be and then hell go in for a shoulder reconstruction
785007 i thought it was going to be a long day
785008 sydney kicked those four goals and it all happened so quickly they won it straight out of the centre and i dont know if the ball even went down into our forward line for a while
785009 to the boys credit they fought back well in the second quarter we bounced back and it shows what a great team we are
785010 we werent prepared to take the game on and the players have to take the credit for working through that
785011 yeah it was up there he can give a spray
785012 we dont think its much but well get a scan done and assess it from there
785013 it was frustrating but were not out of it we play two of the sides were fighting against for a spot over the next four weeks our fate is largely in our own hands
785014 were playing some good footy and we see every game through to the end of the year as a winnable game so were not closing the door on anything yet
785015 no hab a huellas por donde est bamos y s lo vi liger simas pruebas de uso humano

785020 encontramos cientos de miles de huesos y cr neos erosion ndose fuera de los muros de la cueva
785021 por lo que hemos renombrado esta peque a cueva como cuevita de huesos
785022 aqu es donde encontramos todos los huesos mezclados con ramas de rboles

785030 the cellphone is quickly becoming the main communication device for users to speak to friends and colleagues listen to music and watch video
785031 i explained i was with the state press but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
785032 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
785033 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
785034 i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
785035 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

785083 so why not do as the footballers do i get the ball and thats when i spring in action and do what im best at whatever that is as fast as i can however fast or slow that is the ball is forwarded to another player who then does his bit back and forth until an opening fast through and into the net hopefully while everybody see everything that happens

785120 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
785121 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
785122 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
785123 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
785124 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
785125 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
785126 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
785127 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
785128 of course there are some bishops who arent here and the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams spoke about how he intended to be in touch with them and consult with them and try and involve them in this process going forward
785129 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have a high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth
785130 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
785131 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
785132 this along with the fact that recently released healthcare commission figures show that since 2007 our mrsa rates are the lowest they have been for six years indicates we are certainly proving successful in our bid prevent infection in our hospitals

785156 we did the first jump at kirra just to see if he liked it because if he didnt i wouldnt pursue it
785157 i said to myself if he doesnt like it hes not doing it again but he loved it
785158 it was all fine though and when we landed he just got his ball and ran around in circles
785159 he was a normal happy dog and the jump didnt seem to scare him
785160 ive actually spoken to tv vet dr harry cooper many years ago when a team member was jumping with a dog
785161 someone had complained to the rspca about it so we contacted him to do a story on it and he said there was no issue as far as cruelty to animals
785162 we wanted to give them something more than just a tandem dive with two people
785163 that would have just been the same old thing but when you land with a dog well thats certainly something a bit special
785164 its exactly the same as a tandem skydive with people
785165 hes attached to me and he cant get out of it

785213 either they will torture me or they will kill me
785214 they torture us with beatings with electricity they pour hot drinks down our throats no one can see you you just disappear
785215 they want to build their own islamic state and if you follow for example al aqsa tv which belongs to hamas you see its a new taliban state
785216 i think is not humanitarian to leave these people to go back to gaza in this case we need to bring them here at least for a certain time at least until the situation of gaza will be more clear and safe for them to go back
785217 if you come to copenhagen i will show you a christmas snow a real christmas snow the snow that fell between 1 b c and 1 a d
785218 i can also show you a sample of the very last snow that fell right at the end of the last ice age which was 11 700 years ago

785222 hosting a tournament like this is tremendous good for the league the community but more importantly the last two years weve traveled its nice to be home sleep in your own bed eat your own meals and just have your own routine

785243 so it is with human beings with the man and the woman who use the sexual urge in sexual intercourse and enter as it were into the cosmic stream by which existence is transmitted
785244 since abundant and cheap fossil fuels are the lifeblood of our economy the economy as a whole can be expected to suffer significantly
785245 the biggest obstacle that comes to my mind at this moment however is the obstacle of conveying accurate information and understanding for good decision making
785246 having an accurate understanding of the problem will be very important in order to avoid jumping to misguided solutions
785247 the rest of the u s is in much worse shape than here in the northwest i think
785248 we have wonderful assets and wonderful people here in whatcom county and we also have numerous organizations working towards sustainability in different ways
785249 we have a healthy farmers market selling locally produced food and we also have potential for growing a lot more food locally in whatcom county which is very important
785250 not only because its tastier and more nutritious its better for our planet
785251 ive done some seriously back of the envelope calculations nothing too pinned down
785252 we staff this with the minimum staff possible and so far thats me

785254 i would really like to be a task force driven process so its really a community process
785255 when we bring speakers in or bring speaker forums for the task force to the extent possible well open those up to the public also
785256 well try to pick a task force that is skill diverse experience diverse and represents people throughout the county

785266 we have a team working with bocog to unblock sites to make it easier for reporters and to remove any concerns that sites are censored
785267 apart from those sites for example which relate to pornography which is common to every country in the world to block and sites which could be considered subversive all other sites should be free to enable all reporters to properly report on the games as they have in previous games
785268 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide the media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet

785272 rogge said i want to give you an unequivocal assurance that i have not in any way deviated from our position that we require an uncensored internet
785273 i said if that is the case you had better put out a statement pretty quickly he said im here to tell you that theres no deal

785280 federal grants to state and local governments a brief history
785281 president franklin pierce 1853 1857 vetoed an 1854 act supported by reformer dorothea dix to allocate funds to states to help the indigent insane pierce contended that if
785282 congress is to make provision for paupers the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several states instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their people will become humble suppliants for the bounty of the federal government reversing their true relation to this union
785283 president franklin roosevelts administration prompted by the conditions of the great depression accelerated the development of the grants in aid system as part of his new deal program of social relief financial reform and economic recovery drawing on a broad constructionist interpretation of the constitution that gave him flexibility in designing economic recovery programs roosevelt and congress expanded federal involvement in areas where it previously had taken little action including public housing and employment security
785284 federal grants to state and local governments a brief history
785285 he accomplished for much for this parish he dedicated himself to serving the pubic first in the united states marine corps then with the fbi and finally as sheriff he has served as a valuable role model and has laid very important groundwork
785286 the first name that people ask you about when you say youre from this area they ask you about elmer litchfield
785287 if congress is to make provision for paupers the fountains of charity will be dried up at home and the several states instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants of their people will become humble suppliants beggars for the bounty of the federal government reversing their true relation to this union
785288 the set of interfaces accessible on an object via queryinterface must be static not dynamic specifically if queryinterface returns s ok for a given iid once it must never return e nointerface on subsequent calls on the same object and if queryinterface returns e nointerface for a given iid subsequent calls for the same iid on the same object must never return s ok
785289 i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
785290 congress would be continually exposed as their predecessors have been to the alternative of construing the term
785291 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state
785292 the constitution gave only specific enumerated delegated powers to the national government the constitution was not an open invitation for the federal government to take over and do whatever congress or the president wanted the federal government was not to go beyond its enumerated powers and the states retained the powers not expressly given to the federal government
785293 among the enumerated powers we do not find that of establishing a bank or creating a corporation
785294 liberals generally believe that progressive taxes protect individuals better than a flat tax by curbing concentrations of economic power that threaten the opportunity of others and by providing poor families with the resources they need to live independently from this vantage peoples incomes reflect not only their own efforts but also a universe of circumstances they cannot affect therefore the markets distribution of income is not the final word on economic justice true equality of opportunity becomes a social achievement one that tax progressivity advances by changing the markets distribution of income this provides the fundamental measure of a progressive tax system after paying their taxes those at the top are left with a smaller share of all national income than before and those at the bottom a larger share than before
785295 federal programs often have overlapping objectives the gao government accountability office reports that there are 50 different programs for the homeless in eight different federal agencies 23 programs for housing aid in four agencies 26 programs for food and nutrition aid in six agencies and 44 programs for employment and training services in nine agencies
785296 the senate committee on government affairs also examined federal duplication it found 27 different programs for teen pregnancy 130 programs for at risk youth 19 programs for substance abuse prevention 25 programs for rural development 17 agencies that monitor international trade agreements 10 agencies that are involved in export promotion and 342 programs for economic development
785297 a national retail sales tax or vat would devastate the nations economy for years before economic gains if any would be seen
785298 under the proposed national sales tax rate of 30 percent at the cash register consumers would simply stop spending on anything but the barest necessities for a prolonged period of time
785299 this would have a ripple effect throughout the economy with an impact far beyond the retail industry even at lower rates the psychological effect on consumer spending would be profound
785300 our research shows that during the transition period from the current system to a consumption tax the economy employment and consumer spending would all decline significantly the price is too great to pay for any modest growth that might come in the long term many retailers and the companies behind the products they sell especially the small businesses of america already struggling to succeed would be out of business before they could benefit from that growth
785301 require ing many sectors of the economy to be forced to make sweeping changes in the way they do business

785316 it really helps you to teach your quarterbacks to understand the physics of it
785317 the balance the lines of force the kinetic energy and all that kind of stuff it really does help you streamline their techniques and make them most efficient youre not just repeating what somebody taught you years ago
785318 wed throw the ball 60 times but youd look up at the end and see that the running back still had 130 to 140 yards
785319 darryl knew his strength was the passing game and i really admired his guts to throw the football
785320 we would run sometimes out of the i formation but a lot of the time that was just to set up another pass
785321 i said wait a minute he was at san jose state at the same time i was
785322 you have to remember mike wasnt left on his own to be a genius but when he had the opportunity he showed everything youd want in a coach
785323 its very very very very structured and rigid and thats the only way this thing works
785324 the quarterbacks dont have the option to throw it deep middle or check its not a judgment of what they want to do its a reaction of what the defense has taken away thats how we do it

785331 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
785332 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
785333 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
785334 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
785335 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
785336 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
785337 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known

785348 oh im not but i did hire an excellent one and then i carried the crate of vegetables from my front step into the house
785349 wow i sure am impressed with um the quality of your soil
785350 sake already has a very rich and full flavour and aroma so its best drunk with very simple food you dont need anything too robust
785351 personally i like drinking sake with italian antipasto or other mediterranean food
785352 i have always hated this ceiling so much so that when they took it down and we had sackcloth instead i thought it greatly preferable
785353 now i see it in its true colours i have changed my mind completely it is a wonderful thing full of life and youthful exuberance and now i just pray that my life may be spared until november 7 when we formally celebrate its restoration
785354 it has real ingenuity and originality of composition but i would rank streater a third rate painter
785355 there was an incident a police report was filed i almost killed two of my friends
785356 they have four kinds of bread take a chance take a chance
785357 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
785358 i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
785359 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
785360 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
785361 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap
785362 people should not tell themselves i voted across the racial divide i have no obligations to do something in my community or around the world
785363 there were about 30 car loads of my family and friends who came to see me theyve got england flags all over the place it was crazy
785364 they had to give me my chance to qualify i felt
785365 i boxed the no1 cuban i beat him i boxed the no1 russian the european champion beat him i had to get my chance to be there and when i got it i took it
785366 given a fair wind and a bit of luck every one of the team could do as well as frankie
785367 billy joe is the youngest member of our team but in age terms he is very very mature hes a tough lad wed first identified him as a 2012 athlete and he still is were right on course for that the difference is that he may well be defending his gold medal in 2012
785368 we are true romany gypsies that is what we are if you go two three generations back to your great great grandfather hes most probably seen our people with the horse drawn wagons selling the old wooden pegs and things like that thats what the majority of people in this day and age dont understand
785369 and you cant tar all gypsies or travellers with the same brush i just need to get out there and prove to everybody that were not all the same
785370 i would love it to be that i could get young kids off the street and into the gym help them out i would love to think that i could do that
785371 its completely down to him if he decides he wants to take the boxing route he can and i will be supporting him all the way same as my dad did for me
785372 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
785373 i paid a eulogy to catherine who i have known since she was a young girl in a welsh school
785374 i paid tribute to her personality her good life and of course such a talented person and respected by all who knew her we also sang a hymn which catherine would have sang at ysgol gyfun ystalyfera her school which talks about turning night into day
785375 the first 48 hours of any homicide investigation are critical
785376 they wanted to get their boy home for the best possible treatment sadly it was not to be they are devastated everyone is two fine young people have been killed for no reason
785377 we would once again ask the media to respect the familys wishes to be left alone to grieve in peace south wales police has appointed trained family liaison officers to support both families and the force has provided support to the ongoing investigation in antigua
785378 say what you like about the prime minister he at least managed to get the brazilians to accept a nama coefficient that will result in brussels accepting an 80 cut in europes most trade distorting farm subsidies
785379 it is obvious that a failure to address such concerns will reduce the opportunities for governments to pursue policies that permit societies to benefit from globalisation
785380 people ask if we alter the flavour of our sake to suit the american palate we do not we are just selling them sake that we believe is the best around
785381 whereas europe is traditionally wine country the us is not traditionally anything
785382 americans like their wine but its less established so the country is more open to new trends europeans taste sake and say yes its good and clearly a quality product but the next drink they have is wine
785383 but this too is slowly changing there is more potential in the uk and europe as europeans surely have a more refined palate than north americans
785384 young people who come here to drink my sake say they didnt realise it could be so good they thought it was an old mans drink
785385 the japanese are very concerned about what foreigners think of their country so if we have more success in the us market then japanese consumers may give it another try
785386 sake is finally coming into its own as a connoisseur beverage overseas so i do not think the novelty will wear off
785387 the climb in oil and other raw material prices over recent months has driven costs up significantly although firms are having some success in passing these costs on profit margins are under pressure
785388 exports are helping to limit the slowdown in the manufacturing sector boosted particularly by sterlings weakness against the euro however the near term outlook for manufacturing still looks tough as the economy enters a precarious phase
785389 the legacy that amir khan left us was that most of our clubs in great britain were suddenly filled up with asian boxers or any other boxer because they wanted to emulate amir khan
785390 and of course the funding agencies were very very willing then to give us money because they saw the potential
785391 they took me through underground passages and made me sit in another waiting room for almost 45 minutes a man approached me and called me to another room for interrogation he asked me to sit down and presented himself as moshe
785392 after all my responses he said to me i want to talk to you openly when you return from israel so that you will have an acceptable reputation on the israeli side
785393 i might divorce because i cant stand in front of my wife as a disabled person
785394 the patient knows that refusal to respond to the interrogators questions and demands will ruin his chances to access medical treatment
785395 the states obligations are derived among other things from the rules of war and from the scope of its control over border crossings between it and the gaza strip
785396 even if these werent to be fights to the death it is still risky to have a child of 30kg 4 5st coming face to face with an animal of 200kg
785397 its like asking a child whos good at football not to play
785398 the aca which is behind this ban has declared war on the bullfighting world were going to have to fight back
785399 this is because he is more media friendly than the others
785400 beyond the risk that such a young child is taking
785401 it is unacceptable for him to be so used to the trivialisation of cruelty
785402 if i had known before i would have done it sooner
785403 it was a long and complicated process with a lot of documentation and they asked me a lot of questions but i had all my information so i was prepared
785404 we had done so much moving that my mother knew how things get lost
785405 i had a special trunk with all the paperwork and mementos
785406 i felt that if i didnt pursue every possible aspect of this opportunity i wouldnt be able to wholeheartedly request that my child finish what he starts
785407 with uncertain economic times ahead londons tourism industry could be facing its toughest conditions for some years
785408 if the edf offer did disappear im sure that centrica would be interested but that is a long way down the track
785409 there is no guarantee british energy would want to discuss it
785410 harnessing the power of globalisation and overcoming its dark side in order to distribute the fruits of openness more equally
785411 broad appears to have it all sidebottom will presumably return for pattinson but a risk could be taken on jones if england really are to rediscover the cutting edge flintoff was supposed to bring
785412 it puts me in mind of old fashioned public school headteachers or army colonels speaking to their minions
785413 tony blair or sir bobby charlton at first mention thereafter mr blair sir bobby etc
785414 if people not normally given honorifics such as footballers are charged with criminal offences they are given back their titles for the duration of the case
785415 use just surname after first mention except in leader columns
785416 use common sense in a story where two people have the same name such as a court case about a husband and wife or brothers it may be necessary to use mr and mrs or ms or forenames
785417 theres an egalitarian aspect to this it treats everyone the same
785418 weve considered different rules for people who are not in the public eye
785419 honorifics can sound pompous and old fashioned but there are a small number of occasions when surnames have jarred with people
785420 if a teenager is killed for example you would expect to see his or her first name as always writers and subeditors are encouraged to use their judgment
785421 if you let me keep my men in your country i will ensure the safety of every personnel in your army

785428 then out spake brave horatius the captain of the gate
785429 what they did was as british as tizer this was an action made in britain they were english boys
785430 what fascinated me about watching these boys on the cctv footage at luton was their youth and the fact that knew they were going to die
785431 i wanted to know what did they think about as they travelled to london did they think about england

785434 its about moving away from the mega venues which the fringe seems to have got further and further into every year
785435 our audiences can go back to the old days of the fringe where people could see three shows on a night without it costing an arm and a leg
785436 i absolutely applaud the growth of the free fringe but theres a place for that alongside the bigger scale venues and more expensive shows i bet you the majority of people coming to the fringe will do both thats part of the joy of the fringe
785437 ema has been a real success we will build on this and from next month every young person on ema will get financial support if they go on to university

785464 i think that it is very dangerous for the government to get involved in funding documentaries that deal with politically controversial topics such as this one on police community support officers
785465 it may be that there is sometimes a need for the government to make information films on other less controversial issues but it is crucial that these are clearly labelled as government backed projects
785466 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency the home office does not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
785467 public information films used to state clearly at the beginning exactly what they were and i think if ministers are going to fund documentaries they must take a similar approach
785468 expression of opinions and the conduct of participants should be inspired by full compliance with the olympic charter
785469 the secondhand car market dwarfs the market for new cars with around three vehicles sold for every one sold new each year rebranding existing cars could therefore have a bigger effect than increasing the differential for new cars
785470 nature has endowed the great white shark with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
785471 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
785472 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
785473 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
785474 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
785475 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
785476 i am not surprised our experience working with the government is there are lots of nice words and good ideas but its very difficult to put it into practice this is just another government initiative
785477 if the government was going to launch something in january they needed to act on it fairly quick because otherwise they lose momentum and thats a shame
785478 however if the schemes are cost neutral i e incentivised we can introduce them
785479 given that the government cannot get out of debt and is collateralizing more and more land to avoid foreclosure the day is not long off when the people of the united states will one day wake up and discover they are no longer citizens but tenants

785497 i have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in my name saying i had a dream i had a dream
785498 how long is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood even these prophets of the deception of their own heart
785499 the prophet who has a dream may relate his dream but let him who has my word speak my word in truth what does straw have in common with grain
785500 behold i am against those who have prophesied false dreams
785501 and related them and led my people astray by their falsehoods and reckless boasting yet i did not send them or command them nor do they furnish this people the slightest benefit
785502 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness whose end will be according to their works
785503 and for this cause gos shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved

785526 the department for culture media and sport agreement that governs the help scheme urgently has to be reviewed
785527 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused
785528 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation
785529 the dshs must never act as a trojan horse for pay tv services to be promoted to vulnerable groups

785533 we call on the government to stop and think again the whole aim of this programme is to ease the transition for vulnerable groups not to make it more complex or costly
785534 sky is committed to making the help scheme a success in the border region

785574 it is certainly possible and i do wonder whether unions could cope with the resulting flood of cases
785575 when employers seek to use an economic slowdown as an excuse for job cuts they should be assured that we will defend members to the hilt and that we have the resources to do it
785576 it would certainly be disingenuous of employers if they were to exploit the situation
785577 the importance of unions is overstated especially with private sector union membership levels under 25
785578 but figures show redundancies are still running at near record lows and many employers are turning to alternative measures to save money

785596 i want whats best for ergon racing and billy ballew motorsports
785597 i truly believe that were one of the best teams in the truck series garage but we havent always had the results to show for it our expectations are to finish in the top 10 and carry that momentum to top fives and challenge for wins
785598 stremme driving the ergon truck will be an opportunity for someone to look at our team and give us a new perspective to accomplish those goals he has a lot of experience and can give me some advice on how we can help improve performance
785599 ergon is fortunate to have david stremme look at what were bringing to the track
785600 were behind this team 100 and know theyre capable of turning things around stremme mentoring marc mitchell and giving some input to our team will bring us one step closer to getting the ergon tundra where everyone wants it to be
785601 im really excited to get behind the wheel of the ergon tundra
785602 billy ballew motorsports has great equipment and top notch people and im looking forward to working with them
785603 the ergon racing teams reputation speaks for itself i hope that my races with them will only make them stronger down the road
785604 we are pleased to announce that the indycar series will hold its first event in australia this october to celebrate the completion of a successful first season of unified open wheel racing
785605 dating back to 1991 the gold coast indy 300 has been labeled the race with the hottest cars the hottest parties and the hottest beaches with one of the worlds most famous beach side cities surfers paradise hosting 96 hours of non stop excitement on and off the racetrack
785606 this is a great opportunity to expose a country with a rich open wheel racing heritage to the faces of the indycar series and with drivers such as will power ryan briscoe and scott dixon hailing from the south pacific it makes for an even better homecoming after the end of the season
785607 the excitement of bringing the first indycar series race to the gold coast has been building over the past months as part of the planning for this years gold coast indy 300 which is well underway we will see track construction begin in two weeks while we look forward to welcoming all of the faces of the indycar series to town of particular interest for our fans will be the australian contingent of drivers racing on their home turf
785608 we are thrilled with the schedule we have developed for 2009
785609 when unification was announced earlier this year we talked about the opportunity of developing future schedules on a blank piece of paper and with todays announcement we have a solid foundation for developing a consistent long term schedule for the indycar series
785610 looking ahead to 2009 and with one season of unification under our belts we know that the indycar series continues to offer the most diverse schedule in all of motorsports
785611 as our schedule has evolved in the past few years the race for the indycar series championship has become one that demands the ability of both drivers and teams to master a variety of venues and the challenges each one brings with the end result being a true champion
785612 we are also pleased to respond to our teams and offer a couple of more off weekends during the core of the season
785613 i didnt get a chance to watch the race on tv last year and it looks like my first laps on the track are going to be when the green flag drops
785614 these days a top driver can only bring an oval car up a few spots over its technical potential because theres so much good equipment and so many good drivers out there
785615 but the playing field balances out the equipment a little more on a road course and allows drivers to make a bigger difference in the outcome
785616 this venue is one of the neatest we go to
785617 theres almost a mystique about a racetrack located on a man made island in the middle of the st lawrence river in such a historic city as montreal
785618 its a very technical road course which means the drivers skills in shifting up through the gears their coordination of working the gears and brakes their ability to hit their marks as they hit the corners really come into play
785619 because of all those factors any small mistake by other drivers can lead to the opportunity to make a pass
785620 its always great to race in canada especially in montreal since its only one hour away from my house
785621 its going to be a really important race for me
785622 i havent raced there in a few years because the series i have been racing in were not on the list for the grand prix
785623 i know we will have a good car for montreal too
785624 this is the same car that cheever racing led the race and finished fourth in last years event
785625 you have to be on the curb to go fast here
785626 thats the key to montreal the circuit is pretty flat and not that difficult so you need to get down in the corner make the apex and be aggressive i like the circuit the crowd will be awesome and im looking forward to it
785627 this circuit is a big deal and its very emotional on me with formula 1 and the grand prix
785628 the circuit has a lot of background so its always good to race down there
785629 were looking at it in two veins primarily as bringing mr hamdan to justice but also were well aware that in doing that at the individual level it provides the first opportunity to test and validate this process
785630 les libert s publiques ne sont pas autre chose que des r sistances
785631 the only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way
785632 o estado a grande fic o atrav s da qual todo mundo se esfor a para viver s custas de todo mundo
785633 likes you for you that nice or that bad ass you were looking for or even that thug
785634 why c why net why not in a more low level language why a filesystem after all
785635 i was quite shocked at how many students are falling through the cracks
785636 what is the reason for the dropouts is it parenting a lack of parenting is it that we dont have enough after school programs to help the kids with their homework and with schoolwork is it that the teaching that is going on is too boring
785637 we take some of that unnecessary waste and we use it to pay physicians who are working hard and ought not to have a cut in their reimbursement rates
785638 i support the primary objective of this legislation to forestall reductions in physician payments
785639 yet taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong
785640 as evidence has mounted that tomatoes could not be contributing to this outbreak we have urged fda and cdc to change their earlier advisory so we are pleased with todays news
785641 the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
785642 now the ball is squarely in congress court democratic leaders can show that they have finally heard the frustrations of the american people by matching the action i have taken today
785643 i know people are frustrated with the soaring price of gas and i welcome the national debate on solutions to lower our energy costs but in california we know offshore drilling is not the answer
785644 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil the bush plan is a hoax it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence
785645 when people are hurting and struggling to afford gasoline food and other necessities common sense requires that we draw upon americas own vast reserves of oil and natural gas
785646 if offshore drilling would provide short term relief at the pump or a long term strategy for energy independence it would be worthy of our consideration regardless of the risks but most experts even within the bush administration concede it would do neither
785647 the finding was focussed on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change
785648 well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america
785649 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
785650 attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice
785651 too many people believe you have to be either for or against the iranians
785652 lets get serious eighty million people live there and everyones an individual the idea that theyre only one way or another is nonsense
785653 did i bitch about some of the things that were being proposed you bet some of them were very stupid
785654 the process is broken and this is dangerous stuff were authorizing
785655 the c i a needed the finding to do its traditional stuff but the finding does not apply to jsoc the president signed an executive order after september 11th giving the pentagon license to do things that it had never been able to do before without notifying congress the claim was that the military was preparing the battle space and by using that term they were able to circumvent congressional oversight everything is justified in terms of fighting the global war on terror
785656 the administration has been fuzzing the lines there used to be a shade of gray
785657 the agency says were not going to get in the position of helping to kill people without a finding
785658 the over all authorization includes killing but its not as though thats what theyre setting out to do its about gathering information enlisting support
785659 the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do
785660 we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble
785661 i suspect theres something going on but i dont know what to believe cheney has always wanted to go after iran and if he had more time hed find a way to do it we still dont get enough information from the agencies and i have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge
785662 is just that notification and not a sign off on activities proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee
785663 as a rule we dont comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings
785664 it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control
785665 we control the money and they cant do anything without the money money is what its all about but im very leery of this administration
785666 theyve been absolutely unhelpful very damaging and i absolutely dont condone any of their activities and i have yet to see anything since ive been in this job in the way of a public action by iran thats been at all helpful in this region
785667 when i arrived at centcom the iranians were funding every entity inside iraq it was in their interest to get us out and so they decided to kill as many americans as they could and why not they didnt know whod come out ahead but they wanted us out i decided that i couldnt resolve the situation in iraq without the neighborhood to get this problem in iraq solved we had to somehow involve iran and syria i had to work the neighborhood
785668 it would happen only if the iranians did something stupid
785669 one of the reasons the white house selected fallon for centcom was that hes known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the pacific
785670 he was charged with coming up with an over all coherent strategy for iran iraq and afghanistan and by law the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his a
785671 when fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility a small group in the white house leadership shut him out
785672 the coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations
785673 if you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander by default you cant have a coherent military strategy you end up with a disaster like the reconstruction efforts in iraq
785674 fox said that theres a lot of strange stuff going on in special ops and i told him he had to figure out what they were really doing
785675 the special ops guys eventually figured out they needed fox and so they began to talk to him fox would have won his fight with special ops but for cheney
785676 fallon went down because in his own way he was trying to prevent a war with iran and you have to admire him for that
785677 is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country
785678 a controlled press which makes it more important that it publishes these things we begin to see inside the government
785679 hardly a day goes by now we dont see a clash somewhere there were three or four incidents over a recent weekend and the iranians are even naming the revolutionary guard officers who have been killed
785680 this is the ultimate for the iranians to blame the c i a
785681 this is new and its an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions
785682 in gardiners view the violence rather than weakening irans religious government may generate support for it
785683 weve got exposure because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear the iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the americans how many times have we tried this without asking the right questions is the risk worth it
785684 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
785685 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic the u s is overestimating ethnic tension in iran
785686 you can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman but working with the minorities will backfire and alienate the majority of the population
785687 the baluchis are sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in tehran but you can also describe them as al qaeda
785688 these are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case its shiite iranians the irony is that were once again working with sunni fundamentalists just as we did in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties
785689 this is a vicious salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the taliban and pakistani extremists
785690 they are suspected of having links to al qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture
785691 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
785692 the m e k has no c p a auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the m e k is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the administration intends
785693 malikis increasingly choosing the interests of iraq over the interests of the united states
785694 seem to be harming relations with the governments of both iraq and pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between tehran and baghdad
785695 the program works because its small and smart guys are running it
785696 we have to be really careful in calling in the missiles we have to hit certain houses at certain times the people on the ground are watching through binoculars a few hundred yards away and calling specific locations in latitude and longitude we keep the predator loitering until the targets go into a house and we have to make sure our guys are far enough away so they dont get hit
785697 the special ops guys are pissed off because cheneys office set up priorities for categories of targets and now hes getting impatient and applying pressure for results but it takes a long time to get the right guys in place
785698 weve had wonderful results in the horn of africa with the use of surrogates and false flags basic counterintelligence and counter insurgency tactics and were beginning to tie them in knots in afghanistan but the white house is going to kill the program if they use it to go after iran its one thing to engage in selective strikes and assassinations in waziristan and another in iran the white house believes that one size fits all but the legal issues surrounding extrajudicial killings in waziristan are less of a problem because al qaeda and the taliban cross the border into afghanistan and back again often with u s and nato forces in hot pursuit the situation is not nearly as clear in the iranian case all the considerations judicial strategic and political are different in iran
785699 there is huge opposition inside the intelligence community to the idea of waging a covert war inside iran and using baluchis and ahwazis as surrogates the leaders of our special operations community all have remarkable physical courage but they are less likely to voice their opposition to policy iran is not waziristan
785700 yes its more serious than we have seen but to put it in context we do interact with the iranian revolutionary guard and their navy regularly
785701 i didnt get the sense from the reports i was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats
785702 the subject was how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
785703 be possible to freeze the iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed should this newest attempt fail things will soon get serious deadly serious
785704 the proposal says that the iranians must stop manufacturing new centrifuges and the other side will stop all further sanction activities in the u n security council
785705 this could be acceptable to the iranians if they have good will
785706 i think the americans are deeply divided on the issue of what to do about iran
785707 some officials are concerned about the fallout from a military attack and others think an attack is unavoidable i know the europeans but i have no idea where the americans will end up on this issue

785720 cheneys possible definitely the national security adviser stephen hadley definitely either dr condoleezza rice or i think a meeting with dr rice or the deputy secretary john negroponte is possible
785721 the exact budget i will come up with but it will be somewhere between 600 000 and 750 000 with about a third of it going directly to the bush library
785722 i was not there to raise money for the library i have no interest in the library
785723 i was there to get a client we proposed to do specific public relations work for the former president of kyrgyzstan i made it clear on multiple occasions that the library wasnt taking any money yet and that foreign contributions may or may not be accepted
785724 if youre referring to the steve payne situation obviously we would say that that was inappropriate and only people that are a part of the foundation and are acting on behalf of the president are allowed to do that
785725 if true this report raises serious concerns about the ways in which foreign interests might be secretly influencing our government through large donations to the library to that end a presidential library can solicit secret donations from companies and foreign interests that seek to secretly influence governmental affairs

785732 jamie and i were both here and it was a traumatic experience we tried to heal all week and we thought this would be a good way to wrap it up
785733 the way that people have stood up and the love that people are showing
785734 this is just the beginning process of a healing that will take a very long time
785735 no one gets over something like this this is the kind of thing that people learn to integrate into their lives in a way that doesnt take up the whole panorama of their vision
785736 to be able to continue and to reclaim all of this community we needed to re honor that space and to reclaim it as the sacred space it needs to be
785737 as my home congregation i wanted to be here to feel the comfort and be part of rededicating the sanctuary to love and inclusion
785738 its sad that something so horrific brings people together but it really has brought out the best in all of us
785739 it makes you think about why you have a faith tradition and why you attend church and its wonderful for everybody to start thinking about for themselves why do i go to church and is it worth it and our answer is yes its very worth it
785740 we cant keep this up socially and interpersonally and people are going to miss it
785741 its wonderful and were all kind of high and we need to expect that its not going to be that way the whole time and were going to miss it
785742 i did think if i make it the way people actually talk in pubs if i dont tame it and tailor it to grannies surely thats newsworthy

785757 the challenges presented by population growth an aging population migration patterns and urban and coastal development will be affected by changes in temperature precipitation and extreme climate related events
785758 the question is not a scientific one it is a legal and political question of how much impact justifies the extraordinary use of the clean air act
785759 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges climate change demand for electricity political instability at the same time
785760 we can see the common thread running through them deeply ironic in its simplicity our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has to change
785761 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
785762 john mccain has been a leader in the fight against global climate change working with democrats on this issue since 2003 but no one has more successfully recruited americans into this effort than al gore this is a key issue and john mccain has put solutions over partisanship to pursue meaningful market driven cap and trade legislation aimed at drastically reducing harmful carbon emissions

785774 anthrax scientist bruce ivins stood to benefit from a panic
785775 ivins would have stood to make tens of thousands of dollars but not millions
785776 i dont think he ever intended to kill anybody he just wanted to prove look this is possible he probably had no clue that it would aerosolize through those envelopes and kill those postal workers
785777 for the love of god lets try to prevent this from degenerating into yet another rorschach test which is what generally happens when popular culture gets fascinated by an incident they dont know jack shit about
785778 it is so vital to emphasize that not a shred of evidence has yet been presented that the now deceased bruce ivins played any role in the anthrax attacks let alone that he was the sole or even primary culprit nonetheless just as they did with steven hatfill the media with some notable and important exceptions are reporting this case as though the matter is resolved
785779 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary he had in his mind that he was omnipotent
785780 no tests ever found or even suggested the presence of bentonite the claim was just concocted from the start it just never happened
785781 bruce ivins was troubled by the dust dirt and clutter on his officemates desk and not just because it looked messy he suspected the dust was laced with anthrax
785782 one researcher described a common room in the lab area as a
785783 triggered by a technicians fears that she had been exposed
785784 ivins found evidence of anthrax and decontaminated the womans desk computer keypad and monitor
785785 the six member team that worked in the lab equipped to handle anthrax had swollen to a staff of 85

785806 as far as central europe is concerned the past two decades have been mainly successful the spiritual essence of central europe and its cultural and intellectual community which have matured over the centuries and which central europes intelligentsia proudly upheld even in times of crisis crystallised into economic and political reality within the framework of cooperation projects visegr d cefta in due course the region was successfully integrated into the european union contrary to certain views the democratic systems of the central european countries do not perform much worse than those in western europe however the western press seems to take little note of this reports on the region often focus on political extremes yet in none of the central european countries is there a right wing extremist party or movement that counts on as much support as many ultra right forces in western europe the countries of central europe must recognise that it is in their vital interest to successfully further european integration for if european integration goes awry it would be a great loss for the world for europe but above all for central europe
785807 unfortunately 20 months have passed since these welcome words about films on the warsaw uprising were spoken and nothing has happened therefore we call on polish politicians to bring the work already done on the competition to conclusion we know that this requires considerable funding perhaps even millions of z oty but we believe that independent poland needs to make this investment in everyday life we are divided by our political views and our visions for polands future but we hold the view that there are issues and subjects in polands collective memory that require a joint approach the warsaw uprising is certainly one of the most important among them

785830 my take at our recent july meeting was broadly that since the may inflation report the near term outlook for inflation had deteriorated underlining the risk that the rise in commodity prices will feed through to wage and price setting the outlook for demand and output had also deteriorated which in degree should help to contain those upside risks to inflation

785916 the key issue to consider is which types will best serve the needs of humanity in terms of contributing to climate change mitigation

785918 i love what the tool is trying to do which is to realize the internalization or re internalization of the otherwise externalized costs of environmental degradation resulting from co2 emissions
785919 i prefer to hold companies accountable for their own emissions and not those of their suppliers or customers just like financial accounting this still leaves open the possibility that a company can be influenced by pressures from its suppliers and customers to lower emissions but thats all the more reason i think to place accountability at the point of emission not up or downstream from it

786014 christianity did not destroy paganism it adopted it the greek mind dying came to a transmigrated life in the theology and liturgy of the church the greek language having reigned for centuries over philosophy became the vehicle of christian literature and ritual the greek mysteries passed down into the impressive mystery of the mass durrant caesar and christ p 595 3 jealousies intrigue and personal ambitions within the church itself for two hundred years after the disappearance of john the beloved this condition grew the church became divided in many ways no longer was there agreement on doctrine the fundamental belief in the nature and being of god became a source of major dispute such a simple ordinance as baptism became a subject of debate the mode was changed and also the purpose at this time too was introduced the doctrine that no divine authority was required to perform a baptism infant baptism was begun efforts of some bishops resulted in bitterness and bloodshed but as persecution by the government subsided the church again grew in membership partly because of its acceptance of popular views and practices of pagan churches of the day and partly because it lowered its own standards then came the days of constantine the great with an eye to political advantage and not because of conversion for he remained a sun worshipper through most of his life and was not baptized as a christian for 25 years he saw personal political advantage in fostering the christian religion he was of the opinion that with the renewed popularity of this now changed christianity it was the religion of the future having recently fought a long civil war he felt that a state religion as popular as christianity had become would help him solidify his empire he therefore took the christian religion under his wing making it the favored religion of the state gave to the emperor vast influence in the operation of the church which in later times virtually became a department of the civil government placing the emperor in a position to direct it very much as he directed other departments of his government noting the division which existed in the church in his day caused by hundreds of years of bishops interpreting the christian teachings differently constantine set out to settle the difficulty first he turned to africa where was developing a most bitter schism this he attempted to set in order by his authority as emperor he did not accomplish it as a representative of the lord because he was not yet himself a christian he was still a sun worshipper he had no ecclesiastical authority and claimed none but he was all powerful politically it was by his political authority as emperor that he intervened in the african dispute a short time afterward again by his authority as emperor and civil ruler of the western half of the roman empire he called a council of all bishops of that part of the empire which was under his control this meeting was at arles certain of the clergy who were present objected to the decisions made there concerning baptism and the authority of the church constantine resorted to force to bring them into line a massacre ensued blood flowed a number of the objectors who escaped with their lives were banished but constantine had his way in the place of bishops who opposed him he appointed other bishops of his own choice and by his political authority as emperor but this was only the beginning of installation of bishops by civil rulers he called a council of all bishops of the church to settle the alexandrian dispute over the doctrine of the nature of god he listened to the arguments of the contending bishops he favored the athanasian side the arians who still objected were banished and he appointed new bishops in place of them and by what power by divine authority he had none he acted as emperor and the authority by which he appointed these bishops was political not divine they became appointees of constantine not of the lord in this nicene council constantine uninspired unbaptized still a sun worshipper a man who had committed murder within his own family by his political power took the steps which gave to later christianity its doctrine concerning the nature of the god whom they worshipped this nicene creed is still used by many christian churches today and almost all of them believe in the same conclusions even then constantine could not make up his mind to stay with his decision for afterward he vacillated from one opinion to the other part of the time supporting arius and his view and at other times sustaining athanasius the persuasion of his friends alternately changed the official doctrine of the church from one side to the other over a period of a few short years let every honest christian ask himself if god directs his church through such a man as constantine frequently after that emperors appointed some of the clergy and deposed others set in order various matters within the church called councils and otherwise directed what was called the work of god they did so because they had made the church a department of the roman empire which made them the head of the church and all they did was by political but not divine power can anyone say then that the church was still the church of god or was it the church of caesar the roman emperors claimed for themselves the right of convoking councils they supported this pretension on the principle that the maintenance of order and tranquility in the empire devolved on them and that in consequence they had to end controversies that disturbed this order it was also the emperor who confirmed the decisions of the council and gave them the force of law for the whole empire

786018 and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
786019 perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of christ ephesians 4 11 13 there are hundreds which claim to be such simply open up your phone book and you can have a choice of many gods and churches all claiming to be the true church of jesus christ but where is there such a church how will we recognize it when we see it let us remember the lesson of paul to the corinthians already quoted the church is likened to a human body it must be all fitly joined together
786020 you mormons are all ignoramuses you dont even know the strength of your own position it is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole christian world and that is the position of the catholic church the issue is between catholicism and mormonism if we are right you are wrong if you are right we are wrong and thats all there is to it the protestants havent a leg to stand on for if we are wrong they are wrong with us since they were a part of us and went out from us while if we are right they are apostates whom we cut off long ago if we have the apostolic succession from st peter as we claim there is no need of joseph smith and mormonism but if we have not that succession then such a man as joseph smith was necessary and mormonisms attitude is the only consistent one it is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times or the restoration of the gospel in latter days
786021 if religion is good a system that is based on altruism must also be good how can religious people remain consistent and object to a selfless economic system
786022 when a politician calls for higher taxes to fund one of those feel good programs s he is promoting a coercive confiscation of our money since money is obtained from work such coercive taxation is synonymous with enslavement
786023 incidentally this is not a argument against charity which is a voluntary form of altruism

786035 tonight on fox is barack obama aerodynamic enough to be president
786036 my friends my friends can we trust a man who is ten pounds lighter and four inches taller than the average american male that and he may be a muslim now i am not questioning obamas patriotism my friends but clearly he puts a priority on jogging and controlling what he eats whereas i put my country first remember i was a pow in vietnam my friends i may have gotten skinny in that bamboo cage but i made sure i put the weight back on when i got home
786037 im on fire amp now i think its time to bust a move
786038 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal and if financial or intellectual equality is not present then those whose status is more equal than others should demand that these wrongs be righted even if it be at the expense of their own freedoms
786039 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character but if the racism against the negro is ever to be undone if the injustices which held us back for so long have damaged us to the point of no repair and if the bonds of brotherhood are to be had in this great nation then allowing my children to gain access to certain schools or jobs because of the color of their skin at the expense of their character then i say let it be
786040 with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together and to go to jail together and until we go to jail together until that glorious day when cells can be filled equally with black and white then we should not hold the negro responsible for crime he commits no when more of our brothers are jailed it is the racism that lingers in this nation like a parasite to a host and must be recognized for the unfair laws that are passed and the inability of individuals to keep those laws when oppression is our legacy knowing that we will be free one day

786150 the manner in which he committed the crime of conviction
786151 suffer punishment for a criminal charge for which he was acquitted

786286 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
786287 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
786288 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
786289 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
786290 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
786291 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
786292 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
786293 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
786294 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
786295 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
786296 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become

786303 the world at the present time is sagaciously discussing how to quell the controversy and strife over doctrine and faith and how to effect a compromise between the church and the papacy

786307 the true work of art is born from the artist a mysterious enigmatic and mystical creation it detaches itself from him it acquires an autonomous life becomes a personality an independent subject animated with a spiritual breath the living subject of a real existence of being
786308 color is the key the eye is the hammer the soul is the piano with its many chords the artist is the hand that by touching this or that key sets the soul vibrating automatically
786309 the more frightening the world becomes the more art becomes abstract
786310 of all the arts abstract painting is the most difficult it demands that you know how to draw well that you have a heightened sensitivity for composition and for colors and that you be a true poet this last is essential
786311 all methods are sacred if they are internally necessary all methods are sins if they are not justified by internal necessity
786312 each period of a civilization creates an art that is specific in it and which we will never see reborn to try and revive the principles of art of past centuries can lead only to the production of stillborn works
786313 the artist is not a sunday child for whom everything immediately succeeds he does not have the right to live without duty the task that is assigned to him is painful it is a heavy cross for him to bear

786321 whirlwind i was carried away and it was difficult to organise my life very soon after i fell ill and had two big heart operations one after the other it was because of the fatigue and pressure i became an ornament on the political scene
786322 used for political purposes and thus has lost its authority
786323 campaigned for years for the nobel prize to be awarded to one of their state sanctioned writers so they were furious when it went to a political exile

786353 prepare an altar and decorate it with things precious to you and to the one you love using a rose thorn from a white rose bush inscribe it with the words all my love come to me
786354 place the candle in the center of the altar and light it
786355 gaze upon the candle for the entire time it burns and visualize your love coming to you in

786479 what is the optimum level of vitamin d we should have in the body

786481 the issues around supplements are well known and we continue to see cases where by an adverse finding on an athlete may be linked back to a supplement which contains prohibited substances that didnt appear on the label
786482 part of the process athletes need to go through when thinking about using supplements is to distinguish between companies that follow quality assurance procedures to the highest standards and those companies that do not this is particularly important with so many products readily available via the internet which may lay claim to being drug free when there are no guarantees that this is the case
786483 just imagine you could grow the perfect food this food not only would provide affordable nutrition but also would be delicious and easy to prepare in a variety of ways it would be a healthful food with no saturated fat in fact you would be growing a virtual fountain of youth on your back forty
786484 this ideal food would help prevent and perhaps reverse some of the worlds most dreaded diseases you could grow this miracle crop in a variety of soils and climates its cultivation would build up not deplete the land this miracle food already exists its called soy
786485 the quickest way to gain product acceptability in the less affluent society
786486 is to have the product consumed on its own merit in a more affluent society

786493 only soy protein that has been processed in a manner in which isoflavones are retained will result in cholesterol lowering
786494 researchers substituting meta analysis for more rigorous trials risk making faulty assumptions and indulging in creative accounting
786495 the data in this review cannot be used as a basis for claiming that soy intake decreases cancer risk
786496 those who ate a lot of tofu by the time they were 75 or 80 looked five years older
786497 the association between soybean consumption and goiter in animals and humans has a long history
786498 current evidence for the beneficial effects of soy requires a full understanding of potential adverse effects as well
786499 will be at least somewhat predictive of what occurs in humans there is no reason to assume that there will be gross malformations of fetuses but there may be subtle changes such as neurobehavioral attributes immune function and sex hormone levels
786500 could be nothing or could be something of great concern if mom is eating something that can act like sex hormones it is logical to wonder if that could change the babys development
786501 against the backdrop of widespread praise there is growing suspicion that soy despite its undisputed benefits may pose some health hazards
786502 not one of the 18 scientists interviewed for this column was willing to say that taking isoflavones was risk free
786503 the industry has known for years that soy contains many toxins at first they told the public that the toxins were removed by processing when it became apparent that processing could not get rid of them they claimed that these substances were beneficial your government granted a health claim to a substance that is poisonous and the industry lied to the public to sell more soy

786543 nou okay ik ben calvin bomers eigenaar van cb design en sinds mijn 14e levensjaar ben ik eigenlijk al bezig met het ontwerpen van websites toentertijd kleinschalig maar toen ik ben begonnen met de studie interactieve media te amsterdam ging het voor mij heel snel ik kwam in contact met verschillende klasgenoten die al veel ervaring hadden met web design hier ontwikkelde ik mijn kennis heel snel en toen ik 23 werd besloot ik mijn eigen bedrijfje op te zetten om zo mijn werk bekend te maken
786544 het begon allemaal met kleine projecten voor bedrijven van familie en vrienden met dit werk besloot ik naar grote bedrijven te stappen en proberen grote projecten binnen te slepen dit gebeurde met succes door middel van hard werken en mijn afspraken netjes na te komen en mijn deadlines te halen heb ik veel respect gekregen daardoor werd mijn naamsbekendheid ook steeds groter en zo kon ik uitgroeien naar waar cb design nu voor staat
786545 nou we zijn net verhuisd en hebben alle systemen vervangen zodat de websites nog sneller zijn en dus ook beter bereikbaar op het moment ben ik ook nog bezig met een site voor wie dat ga ik niet vertellen jullie zullen dus cb design in de gaten moeten houden

786569 first because this man is mentally sick and also because such time has elapsed that it would be unlikely that any positive result would be obtained which would make it possible for a criminal trial to take place
786570 thirdly this man and this woman are serving life sentences and the chances of them being released are remote so any further investigation is not in the public interest

786605 theres no way bin laden will accept christ so whats the point of praying for him or his henchmen they are convinced of their beliefs they are terrorists for corns sake theyve made their choice and theres no changing it theres no way they will ever change their minds
786606 it was fine you know though its almost gotten to where i dont feel it anymore i guess you can only fall through the air and splatter yourself on the ground so many times before it gets boring i still like doing it i guess but its not the same its hard to remember how the danger felt the first few times
786607 ive thought the same thing maybe we could try something new
786608 well while i was waiting i read a story about skydiving it sounded like it could be fun
786609 just sounds like more falling to me any other ideas
786610 i dont know ill try and think of something though
786611 well we should head home for dinner are you eating with us tonight
786612 just a salad i didnt have time to make anything more today hope youre not disappointed
786613 im the one who doesnt need to eat anymore remember whatever you want to make for yourself is fine with me id be happy just watching you eat
786614 but i put almonds and mandarin oranges in it for you thats how you like it right
786615 well in that case i guess i might as well have some its not like i need to watch my weight after all
786616 you know i dont like it when you joke like that eileen
786617 i still dont see why it bothers you so much i mean sure i died but that was almost eight years ago i thought youd be over it by now
786618 has anyone figured out why we dont remember anything from when were dead
786619 most people say its because there isnt anything last week though i read a paper about this by a christian that was really pretty interesting he said that since god is omniscient he knows when someones going to be resurrected so when you died for example it wasnt a real death he said that they just go into a kind of suspended eternity but if you werent going to be resurrected again god would know and then youd go to heaven or wherever after you really died
786620 thats interesting i guess it explains everything i mean if you believe in god it does
786621 it rained all morning it was cold for this time of year too pretty unpleasant actually
786622 youd think someone wouldve figured out how to control it by now death is easy weather is hard i guess
786623 you know how you only need a little piece of me to bring me back and then you throw the rest away well what if you did that with a chicken or a pig or something you could eat the whole thing except for a wing or a foot youd pull off to resurrect and then stick that in the machine youd have a whole new chicken couldnt you solve world hunger like that i mean youd have an endless food supply wouldnt you
786624 thats not exactly how the process works and besides that you know i cant let anyone know about the extrapolation process they might start asking questions i could get myself branded you know that
786625 oh yeah wasnt thinking about that but what did you mean about how the process works is there something you havent told me
786626 why not is it too morbid said the walking corpse to her husband
786627 all right it sounds like you dont understand precisely how extrapolation works it doesnt just synthesize you out of thin air that isnt physically possible what the process enables me to do is to take other physical matter and infuse it with your genetic code and reform it into you
786628 i guess this is the part you thought i didnt want to know just tell me i wont be able to stop thinking about it now
786629 wait a minute dean are you saying you make me out of cows and birds and grass clippings
786630 i dont check what the machine uses specifically but thats essentially correct do you see why i didnt want to tell you
786631 okay just let me make sure i get this when you kiss me its like youre kissing a dead animal
786632 thats a very crude way to look at it in this state youre genetically indistinguishable from yourself when you were originally alive and more importantly you feel exactly the same to me youre just as beautiful to me now as youve always been
786633 i have an important project that im working on right now so would you mind if we turned in early tonight
786634 again weve been doing that a lot more lately sorry i didnt really mean that i guess i just miss you but its okay
786635 the needle man you must really be distracted i mean sure it gets the job done but theres no drama to it no action and besides you know it takes a while to work arent you in a hurry to get back to work
786636 but it might feel good going in you know before it came back up and everything we could try at least
786637 its all right chloe i dont think id be able to swallow anything that would taste good anyway
786638 well isnt there something i can do i feel kind of dumb just sitting here with you
786639 you know that having you with me is the only thing that makes me feel even a little bit better you do more than enough for me really
786640 but its not enough dad nothing is youre dying youre too sick to do anything anymore
786641 are higher than ours i know the verse dad but it isnt fair i mean whats going to happen to me it would be easier to accept it if mom was still here then id still have someone to take care of me
786642 youll be okay chloe you know how many people at church have offered to take you in and besides that youre a very mature girl youre very grown up for your age
786643 yeah dad i know im mature i have to be but im still a girl too i guess god doesnt think i deserve to have fun
786644 chloe you know what ive told you i love having you here with me but only if you want to be here i want you to be happy and if youre not happy here if you need time to go away and be a girl again and have fun and not worry all the time then thats what i want you to do you know i mean that
786645 yeah dad i do but i couldnt be happy somewhere else if i knew you were still here i couldnt just leave you like that i love you way to much to do that
786646 i know you do chloe but i dont want you to feel like youre obligated to be here that youd be doing something wrong if you left
786647 i know dad but i want to stay here with you i want to spend as much time with you as i can
786648 sorry dad i guess i didnt realize how much i was leaning on you
786649 no im okay chloe actually i think id like to try and eat something now do you still have time to fix something before school
786650 of course i do dad and id still do it even if i didnt what would you like to try

786659 each party body is a centrifugal magnet of contemporary fashion design billboard postures and a la mode attitude spinning through magazines and youtube but amidst the excitement there is pixilation and jaundice skin among each conflation of pattern and tattoo flesh appears deformed and ruined so each body surface becomes a multi layered fact of natures being written by culture and science and vice versa is this flesh on tattoo and pattern or vice versa
786660 each body becomes an index of passing time bones shift muscles loosen freckles and wrinkles form bruises appear skin is the forum for these transitions it may also evidence sensitivity embarrassment discomfort fear excitement infection health attraction and energy expended reflecting vulnerability and conditions weve inhabited

786698 it is entirely clear that the miller courts basis for saying that the second amendment did not apply was

786712 does not preempt state or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates to other products in addition to devices
786713 the same fda regulation fails to alter our interpretation of the statutory text insofar as the outcome of this case is concerned
786714 e ven assuming that this regulation could play a role in defining the mdas pre emptive scope
786715 t he agencys reading of its own rule is entitled to substantial deference
786716 n either accept s nor reject s the proposition that this regulation can be properly consulted to determine the statutes meaning
786717 through statements in regulations preambles interpretive statements and responses to comments
786718 special understanding of the likely impact of both state and federal requirements as well as an understanding of whether state requirements may interfere with federal objectives
786719 the fda is specifically charged in the pma process with weighing the potential risks of injury and illness against the probable benefits to the health of the patient so the jury is doing the same thing that the fda did
786720 congress must have intended that courts look elsewhere for help as to just which federal requirements pre empt just which state requirements as well as just how they might do so
786721 the historic police powers of the states a re not to be superseded unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress
786722 s tatutory rules like this courts presumption against preemption are the most critical component of this courts federalism doctrine
786723 b ecause the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly pre empt state law causes of action
786724 w hile the common law remedy is limited to damages a liability award can be indeed is designed to be a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy
786725 the overriding purpose of the fdca was to provide additional protection to consumers
786726 tort law has an entirely separate function compensating victims that sets it apart from direct forms of regulation
786727 a jury on the other hand sees only the cost of a more dangerous design and is not concerned with its benefits the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court
786728 whats going on is simply one jury has decided that in its judgment there was a safer device that should have been used and because of the judgment of that one jury the manufacturer is placed at risk in selling a device that scientists at the fda have said is okay
786729 w hether the prescription drug labeling judgments imposed on manufacturers by the fda pursuant to fdas comprehensive safety and efficacy authority under the fdca preempt state law product liability claims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were necessary to make drugs reasonably safe for use
786730 all in all we think that the fda regulation can add nothing to our analysis but confusion
786731 it is not certain that an agency regulation determining the pre emptive effect of
786732 this is a case about an administrative agencys power to preempt state laws
786733 n o case from this court has ever applied such a deferential standard to an agency decision that could so easily disrupt the federal state balance
786734 in the case before us the fda has supported the position taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of the statute
786735 did the agency make a considered examination of the various risks when it decided on its course of action
786736 seeking to marry a proper understanding of preemption with appropriate design of the underlying regulatory regime
786737 weig h any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use

786741 an expression of societys moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct
786742 victim impact evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim and the emotional impact of the crimes on the victims family
786743 life is over for the victim of the murderer for the rape victim life may not be nearly so happy as it was but it is not over and normally is not beyond repair
786744 all those factors which give it power to persuade if lacking power to control
786745 the thoroughness evident in its consideration the validity of its reasoning and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements
786746 it is certainly true that the fda previously took a different view but as the third circuit noted in
786747 t he governments previous anti preemption position is also inconsistent with the risk management principles that the fda currently follows
786748 the state duties in such a case parallel rather than add to federal requirements
786749 then the states can issue regulations that go beyond beyond what the fda says in drug matters i would be surprised if thats the case
786750 i t has not been established as the dissent assumes that no tort lawsuits are pre empted by drug or additive approval under the fdca
786751 the process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the pma process for medical devices
786752 fdas risk benefit balancing for devices is parallel to the risk benefit balancing it undertakes as part of the pre market approval process for drugs
786753 fda concluded that the drug with its approved methods of administration and as labeled was both safe and effective
786754 jury concluded that the same drug with its approved methods of administration and as labeled was unreasonably dangerous
786755 fda approval of labeling under the act preempts conflicting or contrary state law
786756 product liability lawsuits have directly threatened the agencys ability to regulate manufacturer dissemination of risk information for prescription drugs in accordance with the fdca
786757 t he centerpiece of risk management for prescription drugs generally is the labeling which reflects thorough fda review of the pertinent scientific evidence
786758 additional requirements for the disclosure of risk information are not necessarily more protective of patients
786759 can erode and disrupt the careful and truthful representation of benefits and risks that prescribers need to make appropriate judgments about drug use
786760 labeling that includes theoretical hazards not well grounded in scientific evidence can cause meaningful risk information to lose its significance
786761 e xaggeration of risk or inclusion of speculative or hypothetical risks could discourage appropriate use of a beneficial drug
786762 thank god we dont rely on the fda to rely on this drug and make the safe decision you will make the decision
786763 t he united states earlier position was based in part on proposed regulations that fda has since withdrawn and its prior position is inconsistent with fdas current understanding and application of the risk management principles discussed above e g the need to prevent over warning neither fdas reasoned change in position nor the absence of a formal agency regulation addressing the specific question presented here negates deference
786764 a n agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to provide a reasoned analysis for the change
786765 if you look at the file of a pma proceeding after it is concluded can you tell exactly which design features and which risks the fda has considered
786766 no i dont think you can the fda will have examined and presumably done its job with respect to every aspect of the design manufacture and labeling of the device
786767 yesterdays decision seemed in step with the courts recent rulings favoring business and expressing skepticism about the role of civil lawsuits in disciplining corporations
786768 the courts holding does not reach an important issue outside the bounds of this case where evidence of a medical devices defect comes to light only
786769 m aybe in this context it is best to conceptualize it as field preemption of the things that are included within the application that is submitted to the fda and the labeling
786770 w e have to say that we feel better about link
786771 was clearly a valentine gift a few days belated to drug companies and theres more to come
786772 now who would you rather have make the decision as to whether this drug is on balance going to save people or on balance going to hurt people
786773 nothing in the amendments shall be construed as invalidating any provision of state law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of state law
786774 i would think that if everything that counsel for device manufacturer said about new devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs because the testing procedures are much longer are they not
786775 t o add or strengthen a contraindication warning precaution or adverse reaction
786776 t o add or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product
786777 t hat reading is supported by the history of the regulation and its relationship to the purposes of the fdca as a whole it is also the interpretation that fda has reasonably advanced
786778 as a practical matter fda encourages sponsors to consult with fda prior to adding safety related information to the labeling for an approved product even when such a change is submitted in a cbe supplement and sponsors typically do so
786779 would disrupt fdas careful balancing of how the risks and benefits of the product should be communicated
786780 data analyses or other information not previously submitted to the agency or submitted within a reasonable time period prior to the cbe supplement that provides novel information about the product such as a risk that is different in type or severity than previously known risks about the product
786781 provoked charges that it had flouted its obligation to consult with state and local authorities and circumvented the proper notice and comment process
786782 consistent with executive order 13 132 courts might condition deference to agency interpretations of the preemptive scope of regulations on compliance with various congressional and executive measures designed to increase the public participation of states the legislature and outside political groups consultation mandates federalism impact statements or even notice and comment periods could be required for all preemption statements
786783 fda invites comments regarding the circumstances when information regarding a safety issue associated with a drug
786784 fda was thus fully aware of the risk of an inadvertent intra arterial injection and the labeling or revised labeling it approved uniformly contained warnings to address that risk
786785 t he agency could not reasonably be expected to expressly reject every possible variant of approved labeling as part of its decisional process
786786 t he fda could have rejected the new warning for any number of reasons including clarity or technical accuracy without implicitly prohibiting a stronger warning
786787 clutter the presence of so much information that physicians would find it hard to distinguish important information from relatively unimportant information and might not even bother to peruse all the information
786788 with the passage of time however it would be increasingly difficult to reconstruct the agencys decisionmaking process
786789 r espondent has never suggested that wyeth had any new information about the risks of iv administration of phenergan that would have warranted a change without fda approval

786807 because the court did not definitively resolve the issue there likely will be additional litigation until the supreme court resolves it once and for all
786808 testimony is neither per se admissible nor per se inadmissible the question whether such testimony is relevant and sufficiently more probative than unfairly prejudicial in a particular case is fact based and depends on many factors including how closely related the evidence is to the plaintiffs circumstances and theory of the case

786812 as in many rape cases there are rarely witnesses leaving the factfinder to weigh one persons word against anothers
786813 this is especially critical because sexual harassment often takes place in the absence of third party witnesses
786814 because sexual advances and requests for sexual favors tend to occur in the corridors of privacy there are often no third party witnesses

786822 testimony from other employees not similarly situated is not admissible where the plaintiff has made no independent showing of a company wide policy of discrimination
786823 i do not believe the district court abused its discretion in its evidentiary rulings excluding testimony
786824 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issues or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence
786825 the use of me too evidence is likely to significantly increase as a result of the notoriety of the mendelsohn decision and the increasing importance of comparative type evidence to employment discrimination litigation

786828 an appellate court should not presume that a district court intended an incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible of a correct reading particularly when the applicable standard of review is deferential
786829 the supreme court has directed that we afford broad discretion to a district courts evidentiary rulings
786830 many rulings on evidence of course do not bear dispositively on the adequacy of the proof to support a verdict
786831 employers predict juror confusion and prejudice minitrials within trials and lengthy and costly discovery
786832 g iven the limited importance of these two cases and the absence of any direct conflicts it appears the court may have taken the cases simply to correct erroneous lower court decisions and thereby to deprive the unions of their victories
786833 the united states supporting sprint takes the position that although this evidence is not always non admissible it was properly not admitted in this case
786834 the otherwise mendelsohn supportive justices breyer and souter appear to believe that scalias best point is that we should defer to the trial court absent an abuse of discretion
786835 justice scalia seems to suggest that this case should be about the appropriate standard of review for the appellate court if theres any basis on which the district courts decision would have been correct the district courts decision is upheld
786836 unfortunately the court decided the case on procedural grounds and as a result the court did not promulgate any clear legal rules

786956 adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills
786957 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
786958 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
786959 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
786960 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
786961 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
786962 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people

786965 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
786966 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
786967 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby

786969 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age

786971 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins

786989 postmodernism is addling the brain and wasting the time of some our brightest young people
786990 this book is about what a group of intelligent students think postmodernism is
786991 you could say they dont have it right they dont understand it they havent grasped it but if this is what they think postmodernism is if it has led them to argue in these ways then its educationally damaging irrespective of whether they have it right or not
786992 calling these people terrorists distracts attention from the justice of their cause
786993 they have a very narrow idea of how we use words
786994 they believe words have given meanings and these meanings have certain biases or prejudices if you use words you have to accept the biases or prejudices youre stuck with them that you can use words ironically is not something they can take seriously

787008 there is no systematic association between consumption of 100 fruit juice and overweight in children and adolescents

787148 pdvsas national contracts were valued at 6 billion of this amount 80 was concentrated in the hands of 148 firms in accordance with the concept of participatory democracy in venezuela pdvsa made it a priority to democratize its supplier base meaning that it opened up to the many small cooperatives prevalent throughout the country this way the state oil company fostered an endogenous model of development that is in line with venezuelas social principals by december 2007 pdvsas supplier network included more than 3 000 social production enterprises

787483 i try to stay cool and i absolutely resent any implication that im anything but honest and respectful

787499 our full service with avings program gives home sellers great service for a low flat fee of 2 995 paid at close and this award means people are catching on
787500 we saved home sellers an average of 6 400 in april 2008 in this tough real estate market we allow people to price their homes to sell
787501 we still have sellers who are in denial of the market and dont want to price properties where they need to
787502 if you cant get people into your home its highly unlikely that it will sell
787503 if youre getting showings but not getting a contract that means youre still not quite low enough
787504 ten showings and no offer or two weeks with no showings you are probably overpriced for the current market this is true especially in this very competitive market
787505 historical data isnt quite so powerful anymore you have to look at what is selling now and what it is selling for
787506 shit come in im sorry i was so busy this afternoon

787521 bahkan hal itu wajib karena allah subhanahu wa taala telah mewajibkan untuk memberi keterangan bukan sekedar sunnah anjuran semata
787522 nasehat ialah kalimat yang diucapkan kepada seseorang karena menginginkan kebaikan baginya
787523 untuk allah kitab nya dan rasul nya serta untuk para imam pemimpin kaum muslimin dan awam mereka
787524 alangkah senangnya aku jika seluruh manusia taat kepada allah meskipun dagingku dikerat dengan alat pengerat garpu atau lainnya
787525 segala puji hanya bagi allah subhanahu wa taala yang telah menjadikan pada masa kekosongan dari para rasul fatrah sisa sisa ahli imu mereka mengajak orang orang yang sesat agar kembali kepada petunjuk dan bersabar atas gangguan yang ditimpakan kepada mereka ahli ilmu itu menghidupkan kembali orang orang yang mati dengan kitab allah subhanahu wa taala al qur an mencerahkan kembali mata orang orang yang buta dengan cahaya allah subhanahu wa taala betapa banyak korban iblis yang telah mereka hidupkan betapa banyak orang sesat kebingungan telah mereka bimbing alangkah indah pengaruh mereka pada manusia namun alangkah buruknya perlakuan manusia terhadap mereka para ulama itu mengikis habis tahrif penyelewengan orang orang yang melampaui batas dari dalam kitab allah subhanahu wa taala ajaran bidah orang orang sesat dan takwil orang orang yang jahil yang telah mengibarkan bendera kebidahan melepaskan tali tali fitnah
787526 mesti ada di dalam buku buku ini hal hal yang bertentangan menyelisihi dan as sunnah
787527 setiap orang boleh diambil dan dibuang pendapatnya kecuali pemilik penghuni kubur ini sambil menunjuk ke arah makam rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
787528 kalau kalian dapati dalam kitabku bertentangan dengan sunnah nabi maka ambillah sunnah nabi dan tinggalkanlah ucapanku
787529 apakah sibawaih itu nabinya nahwu sehingga harus mashum bersih terjaga dari aib dan kesalahan sibawaih keliru tentang al qur an dalam 40 tempat yang tidak kamu pahami juga dia
787530 jika nasehat itu adalah suatu hal yang wajib untuk kemaslahatan diniyah urusan agama secara umum maupun khusus seperti menerangkan keadaaan para rawi yang salah atau dusta sebagaimana kata yahya bin said al qaththan saya bertanya kepada al imam malik ats tsauri al laits bin sad saya kira juga rahimahumullah tentang rawi yang tertuduh berkaitan dengan sebuah hadits atau tidak menghafalnya bagaimana tentang orang tersebut
787531 berat bagi saya untuk mengatakan si fulan demikian si anu demikian
787532 kalau engkau diam dan saya juga diam tidak menerangkan keadaannya kapan orang yang jahil tidak berilmu akan tahu mana hadits yang sahih dan mana yang cacat
787533 seseorang berpuasa shalat dan itikaf itu lebih anda sukai atau orang yang berbicara menjelaskan kesesatan ahli bidah
787534 jika dia menegakkan shalat itikaf dan ibadah lainnya maka itu pahala dan kemaslahatannya hanya untuk dirinya sendiri sedangkan kalau dia berbicara menjelaskan kesesatan ahli bidah maka itu adalah untuk kepentingan kaum muslimin maka ini lebih utama
787535 wajibnya melakukan amar maruf nahi munkar telah ditegaskan berdasarkan as sunnah dan ijma umat ini bahkan amar maruf nahi munkar ini adalah nasehat yang termasuk ajaran agama islam 7
787536 wahai rasulullah anda mengatakan sebelumnya demikian tentang dia kemudian anda melunakkan pembicaraan terhadapnya
787537 hai aisyah sesungguhnya sejahat jahat manusia ialah orang yang ditinggalkan oleh orang lain atau dibiarkan karena takut kekejiannya
787538 di dalam hadits ini terdapat dalil bolehnya melakukan mudaaraah 9 terhadap orang yang dikhawatirkan kekejiannya dan bolehnya meng ghibah orang fasik yang terang terangan melakukan kefasikan kejahatan nya dan orang orang yang memang perlu kaum muslimin jauhi
787539 allah subhanahu wa taala telah mengisahkan kepada kita bagaimana sikap orang orang kafir yang mendustakan para rasul allah alaihimussalam yang datang kepada mereka allah subhanahu wa taala terangkan kekafiran pendustaan dan penghinaan mereka terhadap para rasul tersebut kemudian bagaimana dia membinasakan dan menghancurkan mereka semua itu tercantum dalam al qur an dan sama sekali tidak ada penyebutan kebaikan mereka karena tujuan utama adalah agar kita mengambil pelajaran dan menjauhi apa yang mereka lakukan terhadap rasul mereka allah subhanahu wa taala mensifatkan orang orang yahudi dan nashara dengan sifat yang sangat buruk bahkan mengancam mereka dengan ancaman yang sangat hebat dan sama sekali tidak menyebutkan kebaikan mereka yang mereka runtuhkan karena kekufuran dan pendustaan mereka terhadap nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah pula men tahdzir memperingatkan red umatnya dari ahli ahwa bidah tanpa memperhatikan kebaikan yang ada pada mereka karena kebaikan mereka sangat lemah sedangkan bahaya mereka jauh lebih hebat dan lebih besar dibandingkan kemaslahatan yang diharapkan dari kebaikan mereka
787540 dia lah yang menurunkan al kitab al qur an kepada kamu
787541 kami beriman kepada ayat ayat yang mutasyabihat semuanya itu dari sisi rabb kami
787542 maka jika kamu melihat orang orang yang mengikuti apa yang mutasyabih dari merekalah yang disebut oleh allah maka jauhilah mereka
787543 akan keluar di tengah tengah kalian satu kaum yang kalian meremehkan shalat kalian bila dibandingkan dengan shalat mereka puasa kalian dengan puasa mereka amalan kalian dengan amalan mereka
787544 al mudaaraah artinya berlemah lembut dengan orang yang jahil dalam mengajari dan terkadang dengan orang yang fasiq dalam melarang dari perbuatan jeleknya dan tidak menyikapi keras dan mengingkarinya dengan ucapan serta perbuatan yang lembut lebih lebih bila dibutuhkan untuk dilunakkan hatinya
787545 for the first time since opening weve been able to establish a strong foothold in the local real estate market sellers are excited about the additional exposure we can offer their homes and buyers are responding positively as well

787662 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
787663 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
787664 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
787665 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
787666 the nightly soap opera has mainly female viewers glued to their tv sets not only because mohannad is a cuter version of justin timberlake but because he offers something many lack in their lives romance tenderness and a supportive partner to his independent wife mohannad has become the standard against which many arab men are being judged much to their chagrin

787672 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
787673 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
787674 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
787675 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
787676 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
787677 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
787678 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
787679 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
787680 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
787681 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

787687 once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heavens
787688 have adopted an ideology that opposes the concept of gender roles
787689 you are my son today i have become your father
787690 you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek
787691 the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever
787692 the promised land is not firstly a geographic area but a way of life that is entered into when we enter into the way of god
787693 the time has come for help without delay we hereby announce
787694 im just excited to be here to stand before you all and get to work with my teammates and my coaches

787699 the opportunity cost of higher education or student debt crisis
787700 while first student and its executives rake in the cash its school bus workers are paid low wages work long hours and dont always have adequate health insurance
787701 le nostre assicurazioni sono pi serie e affidabili dei politici italiani
787702 in cui la tutela giuridica delle formazioni sociali diverse da ununione eterosessuale considerata inesistente dalla politica ma ormai voluta dallintera societ civile tuttavia decine di migliaia di coppie lesbiche e gay ne stanno facendo le spese senza che i nostri politici muovano un dito per assicurare loro diritti considerati basilari in gran parte dei paesi dellunione europea
787703 n di disobbedienza civile n di unazione avventata mirata a fare clamore bens di una battaglia per la civilt dove proprio perch i politici non sono in grado di rispondere ai nostri bisogni e alle nostre istanze garantendo luguaglianza di tutti i cittadini di fronte alla legge come vuole la costituzione i cittadini omosessuali sono chiamati in causa per rivendicare i loro diritti fondamentali come individui
787704 ci che avvenuto a fano ovviamente sintomatico del clima di omofobia e ignoranza che offusca la chiesa cattolica
787705 e il voler alzare il dito da un altare contro

787814 hi this is insert name im from the frg i swear i can hear a fake ass smile across their face and im calling to check up on you and see how your doing and make sure all the information we have on you is correct
787815 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
787816 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
787817 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
787818 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
787819 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
787820 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
787821 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
787822 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
787823 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
787824 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
787825 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
787826 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
787827 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
787828 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
787829 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
787830 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
787831 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
787832 if you want a better qwerty keyboard youll need a bigger wider device its that simple
787833 its not packed with features and one concern is the packed together keyboard
787834 we know the keyboard is on your mind so heres the deal it isnt that great but it isnt a deal breaker the phone is designed with the youth market and women from what we can tell in mind and if thats the case they should be happy with the full qwerty of the centro the jelly ish buttons arent exactly a joyride for us to press though weve got massive bear like claws the keyboard works certainly better than t9 and definitely better than no keyboard at all still youll find yourself backtracking plenty when your nail hits a key next to the letter you meant to press

787853 i dont really know where my faith will go after i leave jim elliot school but i dont think it will go anywhere
787854 im neutral because church bible class missions they all bore me its not that im opposed to it im completely open to it but no one has ever made it appealing
787855 some days i feel close to god and some days im so bitter towards him ive had a lot of bad experiences with christians and a lot of resistance is towards him i fear that i will become a christian who is legalistic and judgmental remember in class when we talked about moving towards god and then turning your back i feel like in general im moving towards god but then when i feel too vulnerable i turn my back from god and find comfort in worldly things i want to be running towards god i guess this is where i am right now

787944 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
787945 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
787946 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
787947 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
787948 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
787949 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
787950 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
787951 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
787952 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
787953 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
787954 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
787955 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
787956 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
787957 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
787958 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
787959 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face

788275 researchers have uncovered new evidence that sleep improves the brains ability to remember information their findings demonstrate that memories of recently learned word pairs are improved if sleep intervenes between learning and testing and that this benefit is most pronounced when memory is challenged by competing information this work clarifies and extends previous study of sleep and memory by demonstrating that sleep does not just passively and transiently protect memories rather sleep plays an active role in memory consolidation
788276 sleep apparently rearranges memory within the brain we presume that its organized into a more efficient storage location walker says that means you can recollect that information the next day much better than the day before sleep has this effect only on procedural memories that is memories associated with a physical procedure such as playing a piano or riding a bike these memories are normally used without conscious effort for motor skills that cant readily be described in words furthermore its only light dreamless sleep that works this magic by contrast deep dreamless sleep consolidates or crystallizes into long term memories newly formed declarative or episodic memories such as what you had for dinner yesterday or the fact that paris is the capital of france sleep stabilizes these memories and prevents them from decaying over time

788279 for the most part i think we started the game out with a lot of energy and it kind of died down in the second quarter until halftime
788280 we were just playing sluggish we picked it up finally but i think our defense needs to get much much better we need to keep our energy throughout the whole game
788281 defensively i think we still have a lot to work on just trusting each other being in the spots and knowing that if somebody gets beat there is help
788282 i think everything will work itself out its just about playing together and getting the chemistry down but we pulled it out

788295 today my fastball and breaking ball were good so i felt i was able to pitch well overall
788296 i wanted to keep throwing into the seventh inning but with the rain and everything even if i were able to stay in the game that would have been the end of my start
788297 in limited at bats hes gotten some big hits some timely hits but hes played the game and blended in like our young guys do
788298 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
788299 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
788300 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
788301 when i got him to settle early he just got into a galloping kind of pace and they just left him alone
788302 when he straightened up in the laneway he accelerated underneath me and i knew we had a big shot
788303 when he straightened up and i went past the quarter pole i asked him to run a little and i looked over and i saw a horse on the outside fence almost and wondered where did he come from
788304 after that it was great he just accelerated and i knew i had a good shot from there
788305 when youre going a mile and a half you want to ask your horse to run as late as possible because this laneway here believe me the wire looks like its in malton sometimes you want to be as quiet and give him as little to do as possible
788306 i tried to get him back by hitting him right handed just to straight him out
788307 marlang was pretty strong but i love my horse today note to self easy on the left hand with him
788308 i didnt want to take my horse away from his running style so i couldnt attack as early as maybe i wanted to
788309 i just couldnt get to him i got nosed out late
788310 im happy for debbie trainer debbie england because this is probably the biggest race shes ever won and shes done a very nice job with this horse
788311 from day 1 she told me this was probably best horse shes ever trained and she proved me right
788312 i think he handles polytrack but hes better on turf
788313 i could see he was relaxed and i knew hed be tough from then on
788314 he just kind of said im going to give you a horse to train and he did
788315 taking nothing away from the horse that finished second but when a maiden is the favourite i just thought if he could get up there and relax he could go the mile and a half
788316 i was worried about the distance because he does have a lot of speed but when i saw him relaxed on the front end i knew hed have a lot left
788317 it was my fate to survive while others perhaps with a greater gift and stronger than i have perished
788318 they certainly can co exist if there is a need for both of them
788319 the multi billion dollar question is if theres a need for both of them
788320 for that reason the gulf coast will pretty much take whatever canada can sell
788321 producers seem to be looking for faster transit times and large batch shipments those shipments are not loaded and unloaded from the pipeline theyre sent straight through to the gulf
788322 we have some information but its not coherent enough to provide any detail and wed rather not do that given next of kin issues
788323 he is seeing the search aircraft but were not seeing him
788324 the survivor is located near the top of the mountain and he has been able to see search aircraft below him but we havent been able to see him
788325 ive been doing this a long time and this is the most unusual circumstance in terms of having some information but not enough information to do what you need to do
788326 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
788327 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
788328 when you looked at his reaction when it happened there were natural moments that you cannot premeditate
788329 after the push armour took two or three steps because he still had his mind on the play then he turned around and went to the official to see if he was okay the natural reaction under stress is the truth so i have little doubt it was an incident of being blocked into the official
788330 we are getting to the tipping point if we havent already seen it were seeing ridership drop in all the routes
788331 it affects everything tourism the cost of food services you get into a circular thing as fares go up ridership goes down its not sustainable
788332 we want to meet the minister to start developing one with our route before its too late
788333 there is uncertainty about the impact on ferry traffic levels as a result of the increasing cost of motor vehicle fuel and there is a risk that customers may alter travel plans as a result
788334 the amount per year the minor route group receives has been essentially the same since 2003 to 2012

788381 there isnt much traction in monetary policy these days im afraid because of a lack of liquidity in the credit markets
788382 can help in a rather small way but the underlying risks will remain with the institutions that borrow from the fed and this does nothing to change their capital

788398 the outlook for the economy has worsened in recent months and the downside risks to growth have increased

788428 in 1990 i was hit head on by a car while driving my scooter i wasnt wearing a helmet my head and the cars front end met in the middle of a busy intersection i was lucky that nothing was broken and that i didnt suffer a more severe head injury recovery was slow and soon after the accident i started having panic attacks i couldnt sit in a crowded restaurant i couldnt tolerate the middle seat at the movie theater elevators made me anxious and my biggest fear was sitting inside an airplane for ten hours with a trip to europe already planned this was going to happen whether i liked it or not i went to a therapist who specialized in post traumatic stress disorder she taught me breathing visualization and relaxation techniques i started to find myself reversing the panic attacks if i felt one coming on i could close my eyes visualize a calming scene breathe deeply and conquer the anxiety it was a powerful tool however i realized that i could also create a panic attack just by thinking of the trigger so now i could sit in the middle seat at the movie theater but i would start worrying what if i have a panic attack by letting the idea get comfortable in my mind i could create the panic attack out of thin air now i had the tools to combat the attack and i also had the tools to create one from scratch your mind is extremely powerful it creates fear where there is none however you can control the fear and anxiety you experience around public speaking you have the power to turn negative and fearful thoughts into positive ones today were going to talk about how to do that

788450 theyve decided they cant win on the issues so theyve decided to try to destroy his character
788451 notwithstanding his celebrity status is barack obama ready to serve
788452 it tries to insinuate that his celebrity is all obama has
788453 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
788454 this man does not have a bigoted bone in his body
788455 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea that he was going to be a victim of his name and his race is a lie
788456 he has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist
788457 what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader
788458 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board but theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy
788459 senator mccain understands that you dont begin a negotiation with an ultimatum on the other hand his record is crystal clear
788460 barack obama has proposed solving our social security problem with an increase in payroll taxes john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes
788461 you never say never to anything people have their parliamentary options available to them
788462 but from my standpoint my flagship issue as speaker of the house in this 110th congress has been to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to save reverse global warming im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that will do neither of those things that supports the oil big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer
788463 it tries to insinuate that his celebrity is all obama has
788464 except a couple of best selling books did you forget about that which he wrote himself unlike mcdoodles ghosted job
788465 the moment that obama claimed that mccain was trying to
788466 do we realy want a president who forgets what year it is
788467 why is mccain confusing basic socio economic political and geographical data
788468 iraq is the central front of the war on terror
788469 ok so what else does he have harvard law review editor nothing published himself community organizer a whopping 1 year in the senate no legislation written
788470 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea that he was going to be a victim of his name and his race is a lie
788471 theyve decided they cant win on the issues so theyve decided to try to destroy his character
788472 he doesnt seem to work at anything if it involves sitting down and paying attention to something for long periods of time
788473 he habit is more to stay up all night write a speech and deliver it the next day
788474 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea that he was going to be a victim of his name and his race is a lie
788475 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories

788493 i think that the river is a strong brown god sullen untamed and intractable
788494 all i see is the long river flowing to the edge of the sky
788495 resource scarcity competition for water food and energy in an era of climate change
788496 the glaciers on the himalayas are retreating and they are the sponge that holds the water back in the rainy season were facing the risk of extreme run off with water running straight into the bay of bengal and taking a lot of topsoil with it
788497 a few hundred square miles of the himalayas are the source for all the major rivers of asia the ganges the yellow river the yangtze where three billion people live thats almost half the worlds population
788498 water is not a renewable resource people have been mining it without restraint because it has not been priced properly
788499 this drought is an urgent reminder of the immediate need to upgrade californias water infrastructure
788500 there is no more time to waste because nothing is more vital to protect our economy our environment and our quality of life
788501 theres a growing risk of conflict over water and its not just the typical state versus state conflict where major rivers cross international borders
788502 its going to be farmers versus farmers farmers versus cities
788503 the places that are water stressed are the places that tend to be pushed into a drier state
788504 global warming is apparently affecting the overall circulation of the atmosphere including patterns that govern where deserts form
788505 with warming temperatures were quite likely in many parts of the west to see a shift from snow to rain
788506 but rather one that will impact each and every one of us who live in the southwest
788507 historically an engineer has to tell you how big a dam you need so he looks at the data for the last 50 years and figures out what size dam has a 99 percent probability of being big enough
788508 he cant do that anymore because the old record isnt representative of the future anymore its kind of a daunting task how do we take the information that were beginning to see about climate change and its effects on the water cycle and put it to an engineer working for a given township
788509 a lot of people in responding to climate change are kind of going to be flying by the seat of their pants
788510 if runoff in the colorado decreases a bit it doesnt matter how big your reservoirs are
788511 they could be the size of bathtubs or as big as lake mead they eventually run out of water
788512 it requires so much energy to move water and it requires so much water to create energy that they are essentially the same resource
788513 but the trouble is that the technology is way out in front of the social science policy and regulation the disgust response isnt irrational but it stands in the way of making good decisions about water management
788514 the technology exists to do all the things we want with less water
788515 but no one is doing it entirely right because the pressure isnt there
788516 groundwater the nations subsurface reservoir will be relied on more in the future to help balance the larger swings in precipitation and associated increased demands caused by heat and drought
788517 even though a single snowstorm wont produce more water than a single rainfall it adds up in the snowpack into an account that could be made up of snow from 10 to 20 storms that makes it a much more efficient agent of groundwater recharge than rain
788518 may in fact be very vulnerable to global warming in ways that no one really thought about before
788519 once you have a huge amount of economic infrastructure based on a particular interpretation making massive institutional changes becomes very difficult
788520 to the extent that changes in groundwater management would affect existing water rights there would be legal challenges and the effort would be unlikely to survive
788521 in the case of the amas we built into the system a likelihood of failure
788522 because we predicted inflows that are higher than what theyre likely to be in the future we assumed the hydrology is constant our water management system can simply no longer be based on assumptions that came out of the past
788523 we could manage these ecosystems to be very productive but then they lose a lot of water
788524 the problem is that people have been looking at issues sequentially
788525 at least when you start looking at them together you can figure out how to manage both for example you can try to optimize both water supply and carbon sequestration its better than trying to manage them as separate problems
788526 the glaciers on the himalayas are retreating and they are the sponge that holds the water back in the rainy season were facing the risk of extreme run off with water running straight into the bay of bengal and taking a lot of topsoil with it
788527 a few hundred square miles of the himalayas are the source for all the major rivers of asia the ganges the yellow river the yangtze where 3bn people live thats almost half the worlds population
788528 water is not a renewable resource people have been mining it without restraint because it has not been priced properly
788529 demand for water continues to escalate at unsustainable rates at the risk of being alarmist we see parallels with malthusian economics globally water consumption is doubling every 20 years by 2025 it is estimated that about one third of the global population will not have access to adequate drinking water
788530 weve got droughts combined with a psychotic excess of rainfall
788531 there are 800m people in the world who are food insecure they cant grow enough food or cant afford to buy it this is a seismic shift in the global economy
788532 as we package chips on top of each other we have found that conventional coolers attached to the back of a chip dont scale
788533 in order to exploit the potential of high performance 3d chip stacking we need interlayer cooling
788534 our improved plan unites governments and citizens across the country to take action upstream and along the coast to reduce river nutrient pollution and increase gulf of mexico health
788535 sound science cooperative conservation and innovation will accelerate environmental progress throughout the 31 state watershed and this plan puts us on a course to do just that
788536 the mississippi river built almost all of south louisiana we will rely upon it to help us rebuild what has washed away over the last century the river must be healthy in order for us to succeed said graves
788537 the gulfs world class recreational and commercial fishing is at stake
788538 this industry is not only a major contributor to the regions economy but is a huge part of the heritage of the people of our state and region the culture of fishing has shaped south louisiana and the rest of the gulf and we must do all we can to preserve that culture
788539 the action plan signed today will provide a solid foundation for an aggressive program to reduce and eliminate the nutrients that cause the gulf dead zone
788540 the 300 million that governor bobby jindal and the legislature provided earlier this year for coastal restoration and hurricane protection will allow us to move forward on river diversions that will help to filter nutrients and restore our coastal area a win win for louisiana
788541 clean water permits should focus on water pollution not water movement
788542 you could take a really scuzzy canal system and pump it into a drinking water supply
788543 the problem isnt the transfer its the introduction of the pollutant in the first place
788544 in some cases the imported water is cleaner than the water in stream in the first place
788545 folks on the street wholl hear about wastewater treatment may have some reticence about it the more this languishes the more the fires of suspicion are going to get fanned
788546 you can say the climate is better it doesnt mean its going to be smooth sailing
788547 the quality is extraordinary when you run water through that level of treatment
788548 we dont have as many options as we did when joel wachs raised this
788549 i think people are really more concerned about other things going on like gas prices going up and home prices falling
788550 one of the lowest cost electricity producers in the united states
788551 we will not sit idly by and let buffetts dams poison the klamath river while california does nothing to protect the people of the klamath from this toxic pollution
788552 with this ruling the court invites the board to rethink its assertion that it is powerless to regulate water quality and protect the public from pacificorps toxic pollution of the klamath river
788553 the state is warning people to not contact the klamath river during the height of fishing season and during our most important ceremonies however our medicine men are obligated to bathe in the klamath river in late summer in preparation for our world renewal ceremonies
788554 its high time that somebody stood up to pacificorp and held them accountable for their destruction of our river the water board should use its clear authority to protect the public now
788555 synthesis and assessment product 4 3 sap 4 3 the effects of climate change on agriculture land resources water resources and biodiversity in the united states
788556 the report issued today provides practical information that will help land owners and resource managers make better decisions to address the risks of climate change

788558 things have deteriorated to the point where staffers at people are mystified by the inanity of the political press corps
788559 lets just say were taking a flying fuck at a rolling donut
788560 there could have been more panels with people disagreeing with each other
788561 in a rare act of defiance six house republicans voted with their democratic colleagues to override the veto of the new transportation bill
788562 desperately seeking sarah july 26 2008 10 00 am est by stephan andrew brodhead desperately seeking sarah americans need a little palin power sarah palin the current governor of alaska is john mccains ultimate choice for vp i do believe a woman is next in line for the presidency all conservatives like her she is popular in alaska hillary supporters would relish her she would solidify a 12 or possibly 16 year republican executive john mccains boring campaign is wearing thin i need a little palin power to get me interested again they would say but she is only a half term governor and your point is thats all i have to say about that
788563 sherrod brown he needs someone with more experience than him
788564 and i dont just mean that there were few african americans latinos and asian americans were scarce as well i also noticed that the attendees seemed to skew heavily male
788565 blacks are poor so they are not online as much
788566 conservative on many social issues distrust ed the do good mentality and suspicious and resentful of patronizing elites
788567 confirm that blacks receive less encouragement to apply and are more likely to be encouraged to apply to other lenders
788568 specific minority borrowers are significantly more likely to be sold a subprime or predatory loan than are nonminority borrowers with similar risk profiles
788569 the evidence for discrimination in the labor market seems strong nay nearly incontrovertible
788570 the national community reinvestment coalition recently studied mortgage information from 100 metropolitan areas in the u s some observers say the results have been quite shocking for instance the study shows that in hartford connecticut minorities were much more likely to own a high cost mortgage than caucasian homeowners this was the case no matter what the income of the people being studied interestingly enough the difference was actually greater for middle income blacks than for low income blacks according to the study middle income blacks in hartford were 2 9 times more likely to have a high cost loan than a middle income caucasian borrower meanwhile poor blacks in hartford were 2 1 times more likely to have a high cost loan than poor white borrowers hartford ranked 11th worst in the nation for racial differences in high cost loans since blacks and hispanics comprise 80 of hartfords population its not surprising that there have been so many foreclosures in minority communities
788571 which is not surprising because in todays mortgage market its very hard for lenders to find out what the race of an applicant is while obviously most employers know right away
788572 in issuing credit you have a bunch of statisticians gathering data putting it into their computer which then spits out a formula designed to optimize profit then when it comes time to run a credit check the ssn of the applicant is typed into the computer which then runs the formula on their data
788573 that sounds like magic it also sounds like your fico score plus maybe some correlations matrices conditional on the banks holding not the applicant your fico score isnt the only thing they look at when you decide to get a loan that data you refer to by the way doesnt give you anywhere near a clean of an answer as you might think it does also her arbitrage based argument for why loans would converge to an optimal risk reward setting has problems as well if only cause there are massive transaction costs with home loan searching
788574 rather the point was that i think the evidence for current discrimination is pretty thin
788575 two of these studies find no evidence of redlining but a third which accounts for the relationship between redlining and private mortgage insurance finds redlining against low income neighborhoods which in boston are largely black tootell 1996a hunter and walker 1996 ross and tootell 1998
788576 most studies focus on outcomes by census tract while one attempts to isolate the role of lenders schill and wachter 1993 phillips patrick and rossi 1996
788577 if borrowers sic were irrationally discriminating against minorities their loans should outperform whites in the same loan class
788578 for an interesting study on this see the university of chicagos school of business study on job applications with african sounding names versus anglo sounding names
788579 information on race does not pass from the broker to the issuer and therefore can not play a part in the decision of the issuer
788580 they need the education and training particularly since more and more women are heads of their households as much or more than anybody else and its hard for them to leave their families when they dont have somebody to take care of them
788581 a lawyer and not a thief and therefore a wonder to the people

788583 politically speaking it was the most transformative book i ever read and it ranks as my favorite nonfiction work to this day
788584 a melancholy democrats fever dream with hundreds of small sad jokes digressive stories about chicago ward politics and glimpses of wry self possessed former girlfriends
788585 people scream over something for years that a union business agent used to handle in a single afternoon
788586 but the problem is political types often dont appreciate the literary qualities of his writing and the literary types dont get the politics
788587 you aint a child anymore you about to be a god damned man its about time you start learning what life is about
788588 you know what were going to do were never going to talk about this ok
788589 really if the lower orders dont set us a good example what on earth is the use of them
788590 how likely are you to recommend company x to a colleague or friend
788591 ive got stuff in the works but nothing i wanna talk about
788592 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
788593 i was concerned at the 3 8ths pole and it looked like we were beat turning for home
788594 but he got down on his belly and he won though
788595 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
788596 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
788597 because of convincing evidence of benefit and the strong evidence of safety we urge those who have the ability to support public health the media vitamin manufacturers and policy makers to undertake new initiatives that will have a realistic chance of making a difference in terms of vitamin d nutrition
788598 minimum vitamin d blood levels needed to reduce disease risk is 30 ng ml
788599 i am teaching my law students a class on preparing to take exams i have all the usual exam preparation information but is there any new slant on things you can offer to facilitate their performance
788600 i am in a situation where i know what i want to do and how to do it but i can not seem to follow through on my intentions i get started and feel great about what i am doing i get all excited and vow this time to really follow through but soon the same thing happens i just fade away i cant seem to stick with my good plan and my good intentions what should i do

788608 were delighted to have commenced our recruitment campaign for the first ever nyl season with signings that are totally aligned with our club philosophy of looking local and promoting talent from within our region
788609 brady has been on the radar of the mariners since first joining our youth academy and hes a player that we have identified as one of the central coasts truly promising talents and one that we are incredibly excited by
788610 nathan comes to us from sydney olympic in the nsw premier league but is a product of central western nsw which is represented by western football one of seven regions in the state that we enjoy a partnership with
788611 ive seen nathan in action with our first team in trial matches previously and im excited by just how much he will develop with guidance from one of australias all time great central defenders in our nyl head coach alex tobin
788612 both brady and nathan are players that we had intentions to sign as soon as the nyl was introduced
788613 both have such huge potential and we hope that they can fulfill this with the mariners
788614 as with all players that we will sign we hope for them to not only play an integral part in our nyl campaign but also push for places in the senior squad should the situation arise and both brady and nathan have played in trial matches with the first eleven and made the step up quite comfortably
788615 there is no need to be anxious because there is not long before my debut and that wouldnt be good for me
788616 we have to share the pressure i have come to barcelona to enjoy football and the grandeur of this team i hope we can change the image of the last two years
788617 we have to take the tie seriously because we know we arent in the real champions league yet the team is working hard and thats the way to go if we want to do big things
788618 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
788619 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
788620 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
788621 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
788622 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
788623 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
788624 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
788625 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
788626 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
788627 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
788628 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
788629 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
788630 as soon as he came on he got us playing you never lose that ability he created a few chances and forced a brilliant save out of their goalkeeper
788631 i have had the best players in the world around me
788632 that makes it easy for forwards you dont have to work hard creating chances for yourself they do it for you
788633 the fact i had that and played for the best manager in the world in front of the best supporters makes me feel very humble
788634 when ole arrived coach jim ryan was the only one who had heard of him
788635 jim had been over to see him and recommended to the manager that we sign him i am glad we did
788636 testimonials dont happen very often and it says a lot for ole that he stayed here long enough to receive one
788637 there were probably times in his career when he might not have played as much football as he liked
788638 but he always got himself ready for the games how many times did he come on and change a match for us
788639 none of the lads are quite at 100 yet but every game helps
788640 kenwynes going in tomorrow for an operation and we will know in 24 hours of the exact damage so fingers crossed
788641 well know one way or another tomorrow so ill be saying a few prayers tonight
788642 kieran just had a stiff back the last couple of days
788643 there was no point risking him today id be very surprised if he wasnt on the flight to ireland with us on wednesday
788644 the last few days we all had to switch off
788645 we had this game coming up and sometimes have to prioritise focus on that but im sure tomorrow well be back on that roundabout with speculation of whos going where
788646 ive said for the last week or two were hopeful of two or three players coming on board
788647 we have two or three weeks to play with but dont want to get backed into a corner at the end of august
788648 i was generally pleased with the game today but we probably need three players
788649 im not so happy about one thing if we create a chance we must take the chance
788650 we need a killer instinct normally a good player before he scores concentrates his whole body and muscles on putting the ball in the net
788651 im unhappy we lost the ball on the offence too early we have some problem with ball control we make everything too hurried
788652 we can talk to the players about this but if we win every game 1 0 ill be happy
788653 if we would like to have a striker with the killer instinct we must have two or three million euros i dont think this is the best solution
788654 we can look for luca toni but i dont think its possible to bring luca toni here its possible to work with players and build a scouting system to find a new luca toni
788655 maybe we can do something in the transfer window but the most important thing is for me to work with the players we have
788656 we must give confidence to the players rather than talk about new strikers
788657 there were one or two positives and one or two negatives
788658 i thought we showed a little bit of a lack of intelligence in the first half we condensed the space when we were attacking
788659 bringing on the old war horse dean windass at half time helped us stretch them a bit he pulled off the defenders shoulders to create space
788660 the final third is a little bit of a problem we have only threatened from long range free kicks and follow ups
788661 but the bottom line is pre season results do not matter they are about getting the players fit
788662 testing the integrity of data communications over networks isps and firewalls
788663 bartenders who wish to make a pimms cup without its main ingredient usually mix one part gin with one part red vermouth and 1 2 part to 1 part of triple sec or orange curacao
788664 so what are you going to do for dinner tonight
788665 mark already has dinner plans with a friend of his
788666 i guess youre grilling me some skirt steak for dinner tomorrow
788667 oh expletive i wasnt supposed to add the lemon juice yet
788668 expletive the custard has to chill for several hours before we put it in the ice cream maker
788669 ill just save that until the summer where there are good tomatoes at the farmers market
788670 hello can you fill this bag up i tell ya you people really skimp on these and never give me enough its your fault i have 8 kids
788671 so last time you were on this ok six more months ok
788672 your weight is over the top you should try to lose the weight any way you can
788673 welllllll were sorry but you probably should lose some weight you loud fat american
788674 shes an old lady you should never hurt the elderly
788675 i promise to insult belittle and malign patients i promise to spout useless garbage based on the latest research in readers digest and or the national enquirer i promise to hate my job and take it out on anyone who walks through the door that i
788676 yes you definitely need to stuff suppositories in both your nostrils for maximum effexct
788677 youre fat youre pregnant oh you werent here for an abortion whoops
788678 hey emily wants to know if i can sleep over i dont really want to is it ok if i tell them you said no because i have to go to dads tomorrow
788679 yeah thats fine just blame it on me tell them i say no
788680 the life my parents have paid so much money for
788681 all the therapy in the world wouldnt be able to help me if i stayed with him
788682 im sorry but you still used me to get to iain and are wrong about everything that happened
788683 best friends all ended up changing and i started to realize that my friendship with them was more a competition than camaraderie and here i thought friendships were supposed to be full of support and compassion
788684 so i cant remember are we getting each other anniversary gifts next week or not
788685 well do dinner night in a hotel thats probably all we can swing right now
788686 mother fucker though obama is such a lying trainwreck i go too far sometimes learning on my feet as it were
788687 i think john mark may have touched more alabama fans than any other person ever did i would like to thank the stallings family for sharing their love for john mark with all of us
788688 advice jokes and tough love for people who want to make a living making culture
788689 its hard to think of another site quite like newstrust the fact that they are a non profit whose only agenda is gathering quality news is probably the secret to their success in terms of integrity and objectivity i cant think of a source id trust more
788690 we are a group of virtual assistants people working from home offices that will do your work administrative bookkeeping personal so you can have your free time back to do whatever you want with it
788691 senator kennedy showed again today why he is so beloved in our senate family why he is the model of public service and an american icon
788692 senator kennedy managed to make it back fro treatment for cancer but senator mccain couldnt be bothered senator mccain who wants to be our next president has skipped this vote three times now clearly hed rather hide than face up to the insurance industry you can do that when youre in the u s senate maybe voters should leave him there
788693 republicans will make a fundamental if not fatal mistake if they seek to win the election by demonizing barack obama
788694 to a point where we did not see his color but we truly saw his charisma his message and what he brought to the campaign trail
788695 when people are really hurting and they are right now theyre not looking at a persons race
788696 you cant accept an invitation to the prom until the football captain asks you so im not going to go out and buy the outfit just yet
788697 madrid it will take the united states a century to recover from the damage wreaked by president george
788698 the president behaved like a virtual criminal but we didnt have the courage to sack him for fear of violating the american constitution
788699 we live in a dictatorship we have a fascist government which controls the media
788700 put mccains speech against obamas and this is a wipe out not a victory a wipe out
788701 tonight after fifty four hard fought contests our primary season has finally come to an end
788702 tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for the president of the united states
788703 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
788704 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
788705 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
788706 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
788707 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
788708 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
788709 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
788710 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
788711 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
788712 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
788713 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
788714 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
788715 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
788716 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
788717 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
788718 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
788719 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
788720 we manage our extensive network of ticket agents through our three international offices london new york and sydney
788721 if i failed to recognise this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
788722 so i can empathise with others in the same position
788723 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
788724 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
788725 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
788726 we realise and understand that the ioc are looking to shut down and take further action on that website
788727 but we at the australian olympic committee of course have encouraged everyone all our shadow team members everybody thats part of the olympic family and advertised it very very widely that cosport are our official ticket agent and encouraged all enquiries and everybody to go that way

788732 it was dreadful one fella was cut and everything i have never seen anything like it i know there was rows like that up in grange grange crescent
788733 theyre all the time kind of fighting but never out like this it was frightening now horrible it was
788734 i am deeply disturbed that rioting on such a scale could break out in a residential area like dalton park
788735 although the initial cause of the riot is not yet fully known such actions are irresponsible and dangerous particularly when young children are on holidays and playing in the area
788736 the gardai have moved down in great numbers he said
788737 there must have been at least 10 squad cars went up through town heading for it
788738 the fire department is down there an ambulance has gone to the scene and a garda helicopter has moved down to view it from the air
788739 at the end of the day that wont bring our brother back

788741 they started asking us for our phones and searching us out of nowhere i got a glass bottle in the face i fell down and they started kicking me in the face
788742 having been presented with detailed information from the five medical experts including the two consultants engaged by the tribunal and it is their essentially unanimous opinion that mr reynolds has a significant cognitive impairment which renders him medically unfit to give evidence to this tribunal at this time or the foreseeable future

788744 i have to know the beautiful girl to learn better english
788745 i didnt even know that was today to be honest youre giving me news there
788746 but there was never a problem anyways there was never a problem with that
788747 it was great while we had it but all these things move on
788748 fifteen years we built it up to a really good event but the party needs new ideas and new things
788749 yes i heard of the galway races i heard they are the most beautiful event in ireland
788750 not now but many years ago i had a friend who was the coach of horses and then i knew
788751 he answered trailing off into broken english the translator helpfully shrugged his shoulders not to worry mr trapattoni was brought to galway by a man who knows a thing or two about gambling
788752 the atmosphere in here is so much nicer than outside its easier and faster to place a bet and theres more room to move about
788753 im not a racegoer at all i actually dont approve of racing
788754 the only people who are talking about that this week are ye in the media
788755 they seem to have a fixation with it i didnt realise ye liked it so much
788756 it was a good opportunity for us for many years but we felt that it was time to move on and try to think up of other ideas
788757 its working with others its a challenge to get on with it and do the job as people expect and to manage the situation thats now arisen
788758 ruby has certainly been a great friend to the punters over the first three days a lot of people just back him blind because hes the best around and who can blame them
788759 there is nothing we can do it is the excise duty
788760 if you take these costs away you would see there is not that much difference between them
788761 when specific products are compared on a country to country basis certain parameters have to be taken into consideration
788762 as ireland has a relatively low level of direct taxation through income tax indirect taxes like vat and excise duty are very high this affects retail prices directly and hampers for instance price comparisons on alcoholic products between different countries
788763 each lidl country operates independently and therefore there is no uniform pricing ireland is a high cost economy
788764 obviously we lack the economies of scale and are also affected by high costs for sea and road transport but although we endeavour to source as much of our produce locally particularly our agriculture fresh and dairy produce we do need to import some other produce
788765 we want to win more than 10 games this year

788773 in my opinion all this is just deception and stalling until the bahais of egypt become so downtrodden and submit to any of the wishes of the ministry of interior to the end of being forced to enter only muslim or christian
788774 in the early hours of the morning of 18 july the house of the shaaker family in kerman went up in flames only weeks after their car had been torched and in the wake of a series of threatening phone calls
788775 as would be expected in the light of the mistreatment bahais in iran are routinely receiving the officials who investigated the fire either ignored or dismissed obvious signs of suspicious activity including a muffled explosion simply saying that it was the result of an electrical problem
788776 these latest attacks follow the authorities attempts to deprive the iranian bahai community of its leadership
788777 as bahais worldwide watch with alarm this escalation in violence
788778 their fears that a sinister plan of persecution is unfolding become increasingly confirmed their only hope is that enough voices of protests are raised around the world to compel the government in iran to put an end to this violence
788779 son they can force you to speak german but nobody can force you to think in german
788780 in pursuing this policy the education ministry is in breach of the constitution

788794 the iranian regimes human rights record is shameful a month ago today the regime arrested six bahai leaders solely on the grounds of their religion

788806 the original inspiration for this film was simple enough a love for my familys stories and a wish to share them it was a story telling project

788830 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
788831 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
788832 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
788833 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
788834 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
788835 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly

788841 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
788842 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

788851 they kneed me in the head they told me to get up i had cuffs on i told them i could not get back up they choked me back up they told me to get in the back of the van they pushed me in there
788852 if police get accused of brutality they attack the person in the media

788869 so the store and your suit doesnt smell like chicken
788870 we need local people to enlarge their gardens with foods they would be willing to sell
788871 i understand that you need food you want at prices you can live with
788872 if someone comes in and uses a card to purchase a can of soda
788873 we need consistency its not any worse but its not where we need to be
788874 if people dont walk in that store and buy we will lose that grocery store
788875 its the wettest on record for the first seven months

788896 i felt good about how i was throwing the ball i didnt win some games you would normally win
788897 he was really pounding the zone and throwing strikes it was fun to watch
788898 i was just trying to find the strike zone and i ended up throwing it up and away it was a pitch that a pitcher can handle
788899 when he gets an rbi on top of that its hard to beat him

788916 inform the public resource agencies and local governments of changes proposed to the project
788917 the lack of proper legal limits on the new fusion centers not only threatens to undermine fundamental american values but also threatens to turn them into wasteful and misdirected bureaucracies that like our federal security agencies before 9 11 wont succeed in their ultimate mission of stopping terrorism and other crime
788918 the angry boyfriend or angry girlfriend scenario is so frequently behind abuses of information that its almost comical someones resentful of their new partner so they check out the new partner and they shouldnt use the system for that
788919 i think its important that mnjac find a way as fast as it can to build in an automated audit system both because common sense demands it and the federal standards theyve agreed to abide by demand it
788920 i know they want to do it but there are funding and time constraints that have made it impossible to date
788921 no decisions have been made in regards to any legislative work at this time
788922 its a little early for us to be looking at dollars its up to our oversight group to decide what that agenda might be
788923 generally what were looking for is a police report because we want to have that report vetted through a local law enforcement agency
788924 i have a visceral problem with government being in the data collection business without more of a focus
788925 when you get in the crime prevention business rather than the crime solving business it gets real fuzzy
788926 lets not go down that road unless you can demonstrate that this is going to make us markedly safer
788927 i want to make sure were operating in a way thats sustainable because i think this is real important
788928 this is important for the state and the citizens and i want to do it in a way that we can keep operating
788929 youre not going to get an endorsement from me for this
788930 the privacy policy if you just view it alone is just fine and this is not the worst fusion center model that exists in the country im feeling almost like harry truman im from missouri show me why would i want this
788931 theres often a propensity in government to co opt ones potential opponents and adversaries and its a good strategy by bringing your opponents and adversaries into a process you can mute their possible future criticism of what youre doing i was thinking that might be what was going on but i concluded it was not at all the case
788932 its a pretty good piece of paper at this point i think its well balanced in terms of law enforcement needs and these other concerns but it doesnt enforce itself and so the second part of the equation is still to be solved which is will the department of public safety and mnjac follow their policy but im optimistic based on my observations during the committee process that it will be observed and respected
788933 weve already made what i consider a pretty significant step toward avoiding abuses
788934 this could be crucial evidence toward trying to recover the laptop
788935 we realized that it was a fairly deep question to try and understand how we could build a system that simultaneously tracks a device but at the same time preserves the owners location privacy
788936 i dont want someone to steal it laptops arent cheap
788937 our major problem is the information on the laptop and not the laptop quite so much
788938 the information on the laptops can be very expensive for us to deal with protect and in the worse case notify people about
788939 encryption software that encrypts the whole hard drive all the information on it is for our purposes maybe a better investment
788940 if youre trying to get your laptop back after its stolen these products are something to look into
788941 all three contracts are dead in the water and management has to start over at the beginning

788945 finally new yorkers can say stop the junk and have the force of the law behind them with the ability to file complaints directly against distributors

788947 sustainable flatbush strongly supports the unsolicited materials law as part of our mission to promote sustainable living in flatbush brooklyn it is a prime example of thinking globally while acting locally we vocally oppose the waste of thousands of pounds of paper that unsolicited materials represent we call these materials junk litter and have to remove piles of flyers menus and advertising papers from our porches lobbies and front lawns no one should have the right to dump litter this way we hope that the businesses that promote this practice understand that they are not only wasting paper but are wasting money too

788953 they were the melendez family and a good friend named doug taft and they told me about a man named jesus jesus saved my soul gave me a different perspective on life he showed me i could be a man and walk right the things my son talked about i can have integrity i can be honest i can be faithful i can be true and so i brought what my parents had taught me and what jesus had said and i put that to work in my nfl career and god told me not to leave washington d c so i was there for 20 years that was during free agency time yes i was a part of that i was a part of that free agency but god had a plan for me i stayed the course not only did i stay the course on the field i stayed the course faithfully to this woman for almost 24 years faithfully to my community faithfully to my pastor pastor brett fuller and the grace covenant church in chantilly va faithful to my community and the centers and the other works and faithful to the people i believe that this day is a part of the continuation of gods sovereign purpose and righteous destiny for my life and that being knowing jesus loving him and making him known i did that even as a professional football player everywhere i went and that was done through the visibility the influence the access all that god gives us the lord gives us while we play a childhood game can i tell you today at the expense of sounding real self righteous i belong here i belong here i belong here i belong here because i know what to do with it i know what to do with gods fame with gods dollars with gods visibility gods influence and relationships i know what to do with it to jesus be the glory thank you bless you
788954 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
788955 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species
788956 they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
788957 elephants are also a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries recent reports have shown that demand for ivory is growing in places such as china japan and the us
788958 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again

789003 hollywood says you can be deeply in love with someone and then your marriage will work
789004 but you can be deeply in love with someone to whom you cannot be successfully married
789005 its important to do it before they fall seriously in love because then it will be too late
789006 this usually means that he will be incapable of the intimacy that marriage demands
789007 does he use money responsibly is he stingy most marriages that founder do so because of money shes thrifty hes on his 10th credit card
789008 steer clear of someone whose life you can run who never makes demands counter to yours its good to have a doormat in the home but not if its your husband
789009 is he overly attached to his mother and her mythical apron strings when he wants to make a decision say about where you should go on your honeymoon he doesnt consult you he consults his mother ive known cases where the mother accompanies the couple on their honeymoon
789010 a therapist friend insists that more marriages are killed by silence than by violence
789011 dont marry a problem character thinking you will change him hes a heavy drinker or some other kind of addict but if he marries a good woman hell settle down people are the same after marriage as before only more so
789012 take a good unsentimental look at his family youll learn a lot about him and his attitude towards women
789013 imagine a religious fundamentalist married to an agnostic one would have to pray that the fundamentalist doesnt open the bible and hit the page in which abraham is willing to obey god and slit his sons throat
789014 finally does he possess those character traits that add up to a good human being the willingness to forgive praise be courteous or is he inclined to be a fibber to fits of rage to be a control freak to be envious of you to be secretive

789018 i run a development team at one of the government agencies and just happen to be a former vstser getting folks up and running is not a trivial task but we held a quick 2 hour how to session when we started working with vsts most of our developers were able to get going with cm just based upon this session the trouble came when we had new folks enter the project each one requires a twenty minute one on one workspace creation get edit check in explanation i havent met a person yet who has experience on vsts tfs coming in getting tfs up and running took roughly half a day but the use of multiple domains many reports do not have the fully qualified domains in the urls made us hold off on using the full capabilities initially we had started development at the same time as standing up tfs which was an interesting process you look at the work of vs differently when using tfs get all of those slns out of the documents and settings folders we restructured our tfs tree a couple of times to put all of the pieces in the right place your architects should learn to use the command line build can take some effort especially for more sophisticated apps we are composite with everything from web biz talk vsto c vb script c db pro id recommend simple scripting to augment team build some of these areas required a few of us to dedicate a couple weeks to get all of the respective components built it looks easy but gets harder as you get into all of the things that vs can do work item migration is still in progress as our test folks had been using another bug tracking system many projects start with wis first

789025 we are investigating the possibility that these are one in the same incident
789026 men were held captive under the devil and served the demons but they were redeemed from captivity the redeemer came and gave the price he poured forth his blood and bought the whole world
789027 that we whom he satan held as debtors should be dismissed free by believing in him whom he slew without any debt
789028 in this redemption the blood of christ was given as it were as a price for us by accepting which the devil was not enriched but bound that we might be loosened from his bonds and that he might not with himself involve in the meshes of sins any one of those whom christ free from all debt had redeemed by pouring out his own blood unindebtedly but that they who belong to the grace of christ foreknown and predestinated and elected before the foundation of the world should only so far die as christ himself died for them i e only by the death of the flesh not of the spirit
789029 how could someone educated such as karadic someone so smart educated at columbia university how could he be so evil
789030 we report to no denominational or outside groups in our work

789033 for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant jesus whom you annointed both herod and pontius pilate i e rulers along with the gentiles and the peoples of israel
789034 how can he god still find fault for who can resist his will

789047 weve looked for common variants in schizophrenia and get almost nothing
789048 this means natural selection has done a really good job of purging them away and were left with rare variants a constant flow of them as the principal driver of the disease
789049 this may be the case in other brain diseases too
789050 because successful cognitive functioning is a highly complex system and there are many independent ways to take it down
789051 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
789052 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
789053 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
789054 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
789055 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
789056 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
789057 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him

789066 we believe its important to expose our residents to life after the grove living here is pretty sweet with no worries about roommates not paying rent or bills and the luxury of having a full amenity package at their fingertips we dont want them having total culture shock when its time to enter the real world
789067 we know college is stressful so we help balance that stress with a lot of fun we put together themed parties like peace love grove event where students wear tie dyed grove shirts love beads and participate in green days
789068 other ways we help residents relax are through fitness classes pool parties monday night football parties and movie nights
789069 our events are successful because they are led and organized by our community assistants peers attending the same university when residents feel a part of something they are more likely to stay where they are making our residents better makes the grove a better place
789070 one way we help residents is through designing programs to help them look at things from a different vantage point for example in one of our past events residents helped blow up hot air balloons and took tethered balloon rides illustrating how different things look when you see them from a new perspective
789071 ask any of my friends im incredibly annoying if it was up to me id be up on stage yelling over and over the same sentence that i was amused by that day
789072 each episode is going to centre on a different social issue
789073 and be affrontive with it like my show last year itll be loud and excitable but essentially a bunch of stories about what an idiot i am
789074 would be a post operative transsexual black lesbian in a wheelchair
789075 remembered what the fun of the job is turning around someone whos never heard of me
789076 and i will never turn my back on it ever
789077 the show is about finding the balance between what makes me laugh and what makes other people laugh
789078 but its also all about what happens when someone like me is offered too much artistic licence after having a success
789079 ive written a show where if you dont like it im kind of on your side
789080 my career would be in freefall if it had ever reached any heights from which to fall
789081 if you stuck a bow tie on me id look like a ventriloquists dummy
789082 every tear youve ever cried a rubiks cube a farberg egg the bayeux tapestry the turin shroud
789083 whatever youve still got to do you cant do it any more its something to look forward to
789084 most of us have a skeleton in their closet he takes his out in public
789085 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
789086 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
789087 the peninsular war was the crucible the nursery of the greatest general weve ever had
789088 my great love has always been the age of the red coats slang for the historic british army and the musket and during the peninsular war we see the red coat at its apotheosis the british army was rarely as good before or since and weve never had a commander in chief as good as the duke of wellington
789089 throughout british history the iberian peninsula has always been a place to win your spurs
789090 when wellington was given this independent commission to cause trouble for france an overstretched imperial power hed have relished the opportunity
789091 from it you get this extraordinary sense of wellingtons genius for topography location and the nature of the countryside
789092 later at waterloo he knew exactly where to hold napoleon because hed hunted over that ground and knew it like the back of his hand
789093 you walk around these very high walls and you just cannot believe that the men effectively walked into a hail of gunfire
789094 yet when he wanted to he could fight a very aggressive battle and completely annihilate the enemy
789095 he was determined to conduct battles himself so he was racing around on horse from unit to unit deploying reinforcements personally
789096 british infantry already had a reputation for lining up in serried ranks to deliver huge amounts of musketry
789097 but wellesley did it better than it had ever been done before
789098 he probably regarded revolutionary napoleonic france and its inversion of hierarchy as a threat to everything he believed in
789099 as a military leader his men respected him but i dont think they loved him
789100 he won battles and that was the important thing however the idea that a great general is going to make a great prime minister is something weve rightly abandoned because it doesnt follow and it certainly didnt in his case
789101 i dont think weve ever known a warrior statesman like him in british history
789102 h bscher kettenschutz f r den simpel ch optimist mit gates carbon drive
789103 just because he is black doesnt mean he cant run for president
789104 why not post i have a vagina where we can bring our plates and utensils
789105 im not sure how one languishes a cigarette but i sure can languish
789106 this makes me feel like i reading the inside front of a dust jacket for a new novel very intriguing and well written but it just dont do it for me poetically not enough umph or statement or shock or emotion etc
789107 six years ago i was told that if i insist upon writing to kindly confine myself to sharing my work with my mother i told the ass what he could do with his group and sought out places where i could get the feedback that i needed i found splashhall poetry
789108 the hardest part about critic of any kind is the fact that poetry is art and as art is not only a means of expression but a form of entertainment add in the fact artist poets feel a connectedness to their creation and any negative feedback usually meets with opposition
789109 i begin my remarks by recognizing the tensiled backbone and the sleepy river no pun intended flow of your poem the movements seem to take us along the contours of our inspired coffee maker on the soft edges of her banks we take the brewing process like a tour across her fertile knolls and hidden inlets
789110 sensitive story but what is the word when we attribute human characteristics to animals probably not a nice word maybe attribute all these things to a hiker solitary figure wordsworth above tintern abbey who is prompted to muse as he spies on antelope aware of but indifferent to his presence
789111 i am infused with a pungent scent of coming across a patch of wild leeks the leek can be said to be a cross between garlic and scallion imagine fresh picked garlic and scallions saut ed in rich creamy butter this is the poetic ax in a patch of wild leeks the pungent scent of creativity and friendship this is splashhall poetry splashhall is poetry

789139 the court gave us until sunday and if were not able to serve him the matter is still in front of the court on tuesday
789140 i didnt talk to him for long i just wanted to gauge from him if this is what he wants to do
789141 and he assured me that he wants out of there and wants to come and test himself in rugby union
789142 well just keep him busy on what he needs to learn here and that he enjoys his time here
789143 they say class is permanent and you can tell hes got that
789144 so i dont think itll be hard for him at all
789145 tana just wanted me to know what the situation was that he was talking to sonnys agent
789146 my primary objective was to try to keep sonny in our game
789147 i made it very clear to tana in terms of the plans i had for sonny to keep him in our game not just for the 2008 world cup but to grow league in new zealand over the next two to three years
789148 theres no way my client would be induced to break his current agreement
789149 but once hes off contract at the end of next year my advice would be for him to carefully consider any potential switch to rugby given the money on offer
789150 he played rugby at high school knows the game and would be ideally suited at either at five eighth or full back
789151 i said a week ago if he plays rugby union the door would be closed if he tried to come back
789152 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
789153 i had a great match last night against rafael nadal i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
789154 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
789155 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
789156 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
789157 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
789158 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
789159 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
789160 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
789161 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
789162 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
789163 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
789164 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
789165 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
789166 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next
789167 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
789168 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
789169 iranians will never step back from their inalienable nuclear rights

789186 if im elected president ill sign efca because if the majority of workers want a union they should have one
789187 and were gong to have a president who isnt afraid to say labor needs to be strong a department of labor that works for workers and a national labor relations board
789188 negotiate new trade agreements with worker rights in them crate three million
789189 doesnt have any new ideas so theyll spend their time attacking me instead
789190 so we depend on you to tell voters about where i am on workers issues
789191 i am my brothers sister i am your sisters kids
789192 to understand the significance of his campaign one must remember historically significant episodes such as the harshness of slavery and the struggles of countless men and women during the civil rights era we are called upon right now to fight for workers and their families hold america to her promises and be the tide that lifts all boats
789193 was to bring jobs to the jobless and hope to the hopeless
789194 we can elect john mccain and have four more years of george bushs disastrous policies or we can elect barack obama a champion for working families
789195 we can elect someone who doesnt even know our economy is broken or we can elect obama and get our economy working again its time to turn the page its time to reclaim america
789196 the stakes are too high too high for our nation to elect another president who doesnt respect our work doesnt respect our families and doesnt respect the public services that america depends on and that our members provide
789197 we are not the first starbucks workers to take this step and we will not be the last
789198 even at starbucks workers can come together and make the kind of changes we need to see in this country
789199 id been a half hour late to one shift after being on time for a year then i was fired because i talked about my final warning with another worker
789200 for every person i talked to about my firing i heard another story about someone they work with
789201 its inspiring to see co workers break the silence about their treatment at starbucks
789202 i heard a common message communicated from every woman in this room today whether spoken or unspoken and it was this i am proud to be a woman
789203 i would like to hear that message spoken by all my union sisters
789204 it was wonderful listening to fellow sisters and it made me aware that we are not all that different
789205 these gatherings remind me of why i am active in the labor movement and the importance of meeting to discuss trials and tribulations so we can hear about successes

789270 private equity management fees have come under the spotlight recently with increasing comment in the press about the absolute levels of management fees that limited partners pay on their investments
789271 weve been leaders in private equity since we entered the field 10 years ago were there for the return
789272 not all service companies have become great take over candidates mostly it s the ones that have become technology enabled those that leverage technology to fuel growth and not just people especially those that have crackled the code of recurring revenue
789273 a few years ago when economists talked about service companies they were mostly talking about restaurants or auto repair facilities or lawyers or accountants
789274 in recent years we have seen the rise of technology based service companies
789275 the new digital service economy operates with very different economics than more traditional service firms to double revenue they may have to double the amount of computer power or storage capacity but their people costs grow at a much slower rate and they sell recurring subscriptions which makes their future revenues much more certain and predictable combine these new attributes with the fact that the cost of computer power and storage keep declining on a per unit basis and you have a whole new dynamic modern technology enabled service firms have become cash generating machines that s why they are such desirable take over candidates that s why banks are so willing to lend to help fund these transactions
789276 i would think that this could be a private equity play because these kinds of companies tend to have strong cash flows and leverageable assets
789277 strategics can get the same debt leverage as the private equity players but also they can get synergies and have a lower hurdle rate what i mean by synergies is that the strategics can reduce combined costs and thereby bring more cash flow to the bottom line and also they may be able to leverage product lines to generate more revenue or in some cases raise price the second reason that a strategic can out bid the financial player is that the strategics have lower hurdle rates the pe players typically need to earn an internal rate of return of at least 20 the strategic just has to meet or exceed his own cost of capital which is probably closer to 8 these days that too allows them to pay more

789280 at the high end of the market as defined by size of the corporate customer one can only conclude that the private branch exchange pbx business lacks global scale
789281 the high end of the pbx market has five years of declining revenues before ultimate capitulation
789282 truth be told avaya has done an admirable job protecting its installed corporate and call center customer base while transitioning from analog to digital tdm to ip primary rate interface pri to session initiation protocol sip
789283 now fast forward to the likely scenario we will encounter under silver lake and tpg ownership over the next five years
789284 in summary one can only conclude that the corporate chieftains at avaya knew exactly what they were doing when they agreed to sell to private equity buyers the potential corporate acquirers knew precisely what they were doing when they allowed private equity buyers to acquire avaya which begs the second question that reporters and bloggers have not been asking did the private equity buyers at silver lake and tpg have any idea of what they were getting into when they acquired avaya
789285 higher education has entered a new era of accountability for the last several years policymakers and the public have been calling for higher education to become more transparent in what we do and how we are performing
789286 its time for us to embrace the call for accountability with a visible useable tool

789317 what is historically a packaged goods business is now an exploding market with online connectivity that gives those products a huge lifespan
789318 i think youll see more online features with activisions product line
789319 blizzard would help with that so for guitar hero theres the potential to download songs and generally extend the product package
789320 whats attractive is that you get to unite all of the best development talent in the industry
789321 that also translates into advancing the art form if you look at guitar hero or call of duty the production value of those games can be enhanced to take advantage of the high production qualities of consoles
789322 we will get the benefits of discussing the ways blizzard has gone to market in china and korea and apply it to our franchises
789323 but their growth will come from focusing on their games that have done so well and the same will hold true for activision

789606 liberty heroism honor a love of country a love of god
789607 i grew up in an atmosphere tinged with militarism and afterwards i spent five boring years within the sound of bugles to this day it gives me a faint feeling of sacrilege not to stand to attention during god save the king that is childish of course but i would sooner have had that kind of upbringing than be like the left wing intellectuals who are so enlightened that they cannot understand the most ordinary emotions it is exactly the people whose hearts have never leapt at the sight of a union jack who will flinch from revolution when the moment comes
789608 for too long as reagan saw it the dominant culture has been telling stories that denigrated the american experience and undermined public confidence listening to the left reagan believed one might think us history was primarily a tale of white male brutality reagan wanted to persuade americans to believe in a more heroic story he was more successful than his critics expected
789609 its time for americans to start feeling patriotic about something other than war

789613 it was initially 10 minutes but just grew longer and longer
789614 i think it became half an hour there was chemistry and we realised we should do a radio show together
789615 it would have been the first all female breakfast show for chicks of a certain age
789616 there are not a lot of places where you can tune in and listen to women having a conversation
789617 you can go to fm radio and hear a girl screaming arrhh stop it stop it you boys or you can go to commercial am radio and hear a bloke saying and thats my opinion but where do you hear two women of a certain age sitting and having a chat about life
789618 on the radio you are a presenter presenting information the time and all manner of stuff but this is a genuine conversation and it is great to be free of all those crutches and distractions and just have a conversation between a couple of chicks
789619 its never easy finding a vacant spot in the radio schedule and podcasting gives us the opportunity to try something different in a fairly cost efficient manner
789620 its an opportunity for people with talent to do new and interesting things and just see how it develops some of the shows might end up on radio or one of the new digital stations or they may just continue to add an extra richness to the audio mix available online
789621 weve both had pretty big careers you dont get to be on radio as long as we have without a healthy ego
789622 we lead quite different lives and we are finding we disagree on a lot of things
789623 i was horrified and i knew i had to be happy i was wrestling with this dilemma of whether to say mummy you look beautiful and where is my mother it was a huge moment in my life and i remember saying you look really fabulous but in my heart id lost my mother
789624 brendan said this is amazing fantastic you never hear two women talking like this this will totally work but then hes a girly man
789625 she never listens to me on the radio but she was chuckling and engaged i thought you beauty
789626 what i like about the iphone is that the email function works well i have my gmail and my work email set up on microsoft exchange and that works seamlessly i also like how my calendar is synced to my work one
789627 using wifi on the iphone 3g is great and particularly useful for using the youtube application i have already used 50mb on my 250mb data plan with 3g and i am not too sure where it went using the web browser safari is great i can view most of the websites i visit
789628 what i dont like is that i cant view flash such as when i want to watch a news piece on tv3s website
789629 my iphone has also frozen up once for about two minutes and that scared me a bit
789630 other than that its fantastic i was waiting for a client who was running late at a caf but the caf had wifi i was quite happy to be able to check my work emails and websites while i waited
789631 i still love my iphone as much as when i bought it
789632 the app store is filled with awesome apps available for free or at a cost
789633 the best feature i found was the ability to use your iphone as a wireless keyboard for the apple tv
789634 a few of the free apps seem for the sake of it not really practical but in saying that there are a lot on there that are just too cool
789635 for those who havent seen sms on the iphone it is amazing
789636 i have found one little bug in the sms application im not sure if it is just my iphone or something in the iphone os but occasionally my iphone will stop making the txt alert sound and just vibrate instead i have to reboot to fix the problem this bugs me but its not major
789637 i chose the 80 a month plan with vodafone and so far have found it to be ample for my needs apart from the txting
789638 guys just want well you know while gals go to bed with the false impression of flattery and a craving for feeling desirable
789639 men reported feelings of success since the partner was desirable to others and found the experiences much more sexually satisfying than women did
789640 women were not hooking up in an effort to secure a long term beau but because they felt flattered by the overnight proposition
789641 contrary to popular belief women said they didnt view casual sex as a prelude to a long term relationship
789642 m en lower their standards when it comes to one night stands so the presumed flattery is a fantasy or close to it
789643 often women said things like i felt so flattered so happy that he found me attractive
789644 i felt degraded made myself look cheap and easy total regret
789645 oh i just couldnt help myself i just had to spread my legs and let him fuck me hard
789646 t hey could be collecting healthy genes for their offspring
789647 if youve got a brad pitt character absolutely gorgeous and incredibly loaded with money and so on the chances of getting him to commit himself to you for the rest of your life are pretty slim
789648 but the chances of him giving you a half an hour on a wednesday afternoon in a hotel are probably much better
789649 why do women fall for looks and the perception of money or just the knowledge of money
789650 what the researchers here are saying is that women fall instantly for a good looking guy with money and an expensive car
789651 tell me debbie what first attracted your to millionaire paul daniels

789659 the seats of power can make you rich you know
789660 they can also give you access to things you shouldnt know or what some dont want you to know and people who can make you disappear suddenly and permanently without warning
789661 ive wined and dined my share of power brokers in my day and since im under federal protection i guess i should get rid of this evidence but they remind me of my past glories
789662 well lets get at it my wife wont be home until tomorrow so we can play all we want stand up

789705 webber officially grabbed the torch from karl malone patrick ewing ralph sampson and elvin hayes as the high priced superstar whos great to have on your team unless theres three minutes left in a big game none of this was really a surprise but watching c webb figure out ways to eradicate himself from crunch time possessions was the most intriguing subplot of the playoffs didnt it crack you up when webber would receive a high post pass spin 180 degrees so his back could face the basket dont worry im not shooting have no fear then desperately look to shuffle the basketball to the nearest available king has anyone even played hot potato to that degree even back in college webber was pulling this stuff jalen rose probably took 90 percent of the big shots during the fab five era its almost unprecedented
789706 we will ask that you blog for 50 for the first month while we ascertain the value and advertising potential of the blog after that month we will likely need to restructure the network theres a reason it wasnt making any money redo the pay structure and even let some bloggers go but if you let us we will turn the network around and make it profitable we are fully committed to doing whats fair and in many ways being more than just fair
789707 now it sounds like these guys are basically saying if you can put together a half dozen blogs that are all doing mid sized 150k pages month traffic you have something worth buying
789708 but lets break this down real quick 1mm pageviews per month gives you 2mm high value impressions ie above the fold right now bloggers are lucky to be making 50c unit so thats 1000 month 1k month split amongst six blogs thats nothing
789709 the reality is that small and medium blogs that have real value great content solid writers and an engaged community will always always always make more money from sponsorships than cpm based ads
789710 the long and short is that grabbing a half dozen or even a few dozen blogs together wont net you cpms of more than 4 5 and even 5mm pageviews month only really nets the whole network 5k month
789711 blogging included know nothing about selling advertising not only do they lack the resources to mount a dedicated ad sales effort they dont know what brand advertisers are looking for they dont speak the lingo and they dont have valuable madison avenue relationships
789712 to get higher cpms you need someone to sell that inventory and that is where the bottleneck is its not in inventory or even quality inventory its someone that can go to agencies go to microsoft go to disney go to p amp g go to vonage go to dell and say heres somthing of value and heres why you should pay more for it
789713 because without a sales team youre stuck in the 1 2 cpm world or youre stuck selling sponsorships which im a huge fan of for high quality mid sized blogs
789714 can generate before making greater commitments its difficult to overlook the fact that b5media essentially wants
789715 to continue writing for an amount that probably wont even fill up any of their cars with a single tank of gas
789716 a respectable wage while it determines the value of their blogs just how compelling are the economics of blogging both for the bloggers and the operators of blog networks
789717 are allegedly the words used by gawker media owner nick denton in a staff email
789718 in the blogosphere is just the regurgitation of commoditized news
789719 especially in these troubled economic times its difficult to retain skilled experienced writers with uncompetitive salaries or risky revenue share arrangements
789720 you dont need to shortchange people with a 50 buck token pass to determine the worth
789721 the income i earn from my blogging activities is not my primary source of income
789722 listen were tight on cash but well pay you 500 for the month to fix as many or as few cars as you want after that were happy to pay you the same as all our other mechanics get which is above market rate
789723 we want to see how this works out well pay you 30 000 year for the first 3 years and after that well propose a pay structure that we think youll find competitive
789724 we arent asking bloggers to do a specific amount of work
789725 and the scraps comment was made from a blogger who felt that he should earn more than the blogs revenue
789726 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
789727 some bloggers get paid per post like pieceworkers in a 19th century factory some get paid for pageviews which is even more idiotic from a workers perspective it means youre not paid for your labor except your monthly minimum but paid instead on a sort of gamble how well your product will perform when its thrown into the open marketplace
789728 if youre blogging for someone other than yourself not as a commenter not as a personal blogger those are labors of love and dont count you deserve to be paid
789729 why dont the airlines just automatically call me when my plane is delayed
789730 bloggers have to stop thinking of themselves as white collar creatives and more like rank and file workers after how theyre paid
789731 its about a garage closing where no other garages in the world are hiring
789732 how to hire and retain employees using depression era economics
789733 well i understand its going to take you 40 hours to produce what i need but since i can only sell your work product for 500 i can only afford to pay you 7 hour even though i know your skill probably reasonably demands a 40 hour wage

789753 at times he didnt want her to participate with the family he would be aggravated if she even went to church
789754 then in school one day he came and sat on my lap
789755 and i told him to get off and he slapped me

789757 but ashley told him go ahead which is an appropriate response
789758 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies

789761 sexual harassment has become an overwhelming and very real problem experienced by all women in egyptian society often on a daily basis
789762 the vast majority of women did nothing when confronted with sexual harassment
789763 out of egyptian women and men interviewed most believe that women who wear tight clothes deserve to be harassed
789764 yeah thats cool when the wind blows stuff around or when strangers hug but im not going to cry about it or anything
789765 im not surprised that people like me believed it was real its just incredibly sophisticated
789766 i must say i got a little bit suspicious when i went back in to check the website they still had tickets for sale and everyone was telling me that everything was sold out
789767 the reason why my normal level of cynicism and distrust didnt kick in is that that site has been operating for a considerable period of time
789768 it came up on google ahead of the official chinese olympic site
789769 how is it that a site like that could have operated for at least 11 months if not longer without anyone in officialdom taking some sort of action against them
789770 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
789771 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
789772 so i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
789773 i would say i was maybe more experienced in the final and it really paid off
789774 i hit some good shots she gave me some points in the crucial moments she gave me some good mistakes
789775 i could say thank you that helped me to win in two sets
789776 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign

789785 women are more vulnerable to become victims of violence as the seven groups which fall under the vsu are rape carnal abuse incest attempted rape indecent assault domestic violence and murder
789786 it is for this reason why females continue to suffer
789787 the leaders did not report the person to relevant government authorities allegedly in the belief that he would repent his sins for god to forgive him
789788 while the parties to the peace agreement attend talks in goma their troops continue to kill rape and loot civilians
789789 the government and international donors have provided limited funds to carry out that work
789790 the peace process is meaningless if it fails to protect civilians from the worst abuses
789791 the parties to the peace agreement should abide by their commitments to protect civilians and diplomats should urgently appoint a special advisor on human rights to ensure the commitments become a reality
789792 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
789793 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
789794 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
789795 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
789796 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
789797 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
789798 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
789799 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
789800 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
789801 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
789802 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
789803 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
789804 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
789805 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
789806 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
789807 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people

789821 if you read the blog headline or the comments this is mostly portrayed as linux vs windows in reality that just isnt true
789822 there are many situations where windows or commercial proprietary unix really and truly is the best fit
789823 why is microsoft so threatened by linux could it be that linux is in most cases a better server product than windows
789824 when the migration costs are exorbitant training costs software porting new licenses for commercial software that cant easily be replaced by floss equivalents and the cost of testing and deploying new code are all issues that can work in microsofts favor in such situations if a customer is seriously interested in moving away from windows i recommend doing so when hardware and or software need to be refreshed anyway to mitigate some of the costs
789825 the second situation which applies equally to the server and the desktop is when a very specialized piece of software is needed for the business and its only available for windows to use a desktop example there still isnt an adequate replacement for autocad that runs on linux this scenario is becoming less and less common but it still does exist more so in the business world than on the consumer desktop we discussed in the comments on my previous article the best use for windows in the corporate server room the only really good use i can think of is as a specialized applications server
789826 the third scenario is when a business has a customer who demands windows and not fulfilling that demand will cost the company a valuable customer in those scenarios a company can try and sell a linux solution by pointing out advantages over windows if the customer isnt buying then you have to weigh the cost of losing that customer its often many customers not just one in the end the business has no choice but to satisfy customer demand even if the customers are making a poor or uneducated choice money talks
789827 its not surprising the linux build on an eee won that sort of contest by all accounts xandros has been heavily tweaked for the diminutive machine whereas windows xp hasnt or at least not to the same level

789835 large numbers of girls working illegally as barmaids under the age of 18 are reportedly sexually abused by inebriated customers
789836 this region has been under conflict and children have continued to be sexually and psychologically abused
789837 continuous hiv aids sensitisation campaigns which include advertising prevention services available for survivors of rape and sexual abuse have encouraged people to report cases more frequently
789838 respondents also noted the positive impact of grassroots participation in the promotion of rights awareness and reporting procedures this includes the role of local leaders past victims parents and special police constables people are in many cases more likely to listen to those whom they know and trust
789839 there are a variety of reasons for this including parents using the reported case as an opportunity to extort money from perpetrators

789841 i have no way of feeding my children other than by doing this disgusting job
789842 i am a widow and i have to feed my five children i am illiterate and no one will give me a job i hate to be a prostitute but if i stop doing this job my children will starve to death
789843 extreme poverty and the obligation to feed their dependents have increased prostitution among women
789844 this sex work is an abhorrent deed and an appalling crime we encourage and help security forces to arrest and punish women involved in prostitution
789845 we move as soon as local people become suspicious of us
789846 people will spit on us and no one will interact with us if they know about our work
789847 i have not seen any of my clients using a condom
789848 we will launch a project to boost awareness and introduce preventive measures among sex workers hopefully in september 2008
789849 its a very sensitive project and we will try to avoid misconceptions that it supports or encourages prostitution in afghanistan

789851 vl light is an ultra light version of vl built with a current kernel and current applications but designed to run smoothly in just 64mb of ram i have vector linux successfully running on an old liberty small footprint box with just a pentium 133mmx processor and 32mb of ram
789852 ill be following up my alixe review with reviews of other lightweight and small footprint linux distributions including vector linux light when its released
789853 this particular user has his own criteria for using small livecd type distros such as puppy can be put on a 200mb mini cd and on a 128mb pendrive small for portable use can run on low end hardware
789854 also how do you find vector linux 5 9 unstable also how do you find vector linux 5 9 unstable you claim simplymepis is more stable which implies there must be some instability in vl i havent encountered any id love to know what makes it unstable if noting else it would be something to report to the developers to be fixed
789855 i dont know what you complain about it works here
789856 using linux on a desktop computer at home is a risk a user cannot be sure that he or she will be able to find a solution to a problem he or she might have in the future
789857 your argument boils down to your choice of a specific program and methodology that isnt supported not that adequate and safe tax preparation isnt available
789858 however linux fails as a platform by platform i mean a consistent target for developers and isvs you cant just make one package you have to make several for just about every relevant distro and for various verisons of those distros and worry about various dependencies versions of glibc and so on and package them in either rpm deb tar gz or write your own complex shell script like netbeans has done
789859 linux is a great way to learn unix nothing more
789860 fragmentation linux is linux anything that runs on one distro can run on another that isnt true of commercial unix variants is it
789861 the hobbiest mentality will not get you folks far and i suspect some of you are limited in social skills anyway based on your responses
789862 one possible reason for migrations is the decision by novell and red hat to abandon the desktop
789863 this is not really what our customers are looking for
789864 we need to use police resources to investigate where there is a suspicion that women and children in particular immigrants are being exploited
789865 in april an audit by the u s department of justice found that men who participated in the program were 30 percent less likely to be arrested for soliciting a prostitute than men who did not

789871 the subtle art of flirting is a warm and entertaining comedy thanks to an enthusiastic cast and some sharp one liners from writer director tunks
789872 the grim reality however is that women in prostitution are often unable to negotiate condom use and are at high risk of contracting hiv aids
789873 extensive rhetoric has been generated by un conferences like the vienna forum earlier this year and standards have already been set in international treaties like the un protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and children adopted in 2000
789874 but what is lacking is the political will to curb the multi billion dollar industry

789878 busy parents and crafters dont always have the time to invest in traditional scrapbooking and with the digital share amp tell scrapbooking solutions from lucidiom and pebbles time is no longer a barrier
789879 now that weve taken this time saving binder program digital with lucidiom consumers are going to have a lot more time to create lasting keepsakes with even greater speed and ease
789880 with digital photography growing in popularity it is only natural that the next big thing for scrapbooking and crafting be digital
789881 we pride ourselves on innovation and trend setting so for us partnering with scrapblog a leader within the digital crafting community to bring our papers and embellishments to the web just makes sense
789882 the quality and elegance of annas creations has been an inspiration to us at scrapblog since our beginnings
789883 offering anna griffins designs is a major milestone for scrapblog and for the growth of digital scrapbooking
789884 creating scrapbook pages in minutes is the norm with this user friendly application and you dont have to deal with the mess
789885 the days of downloading your digital photos to sit in a folder are over say hello to technology that actually allows you to display those photos in a fun and creative way
789886 with digital scrapbooks accounting for one in ten of all photo books posted to shutterfly gallery the creativity and craftsmanship of digiscrappers has really inspired the shutterfly community
789887 we have teamed up with shutterfly to launch a digital studio that will provide us with dedicated space to teach and enjoy classes for beginning digital scrapbookers
789888 im thrilled to have the power and experience of shutterfly on our side they are dedicated to storytelling and supporting scrapbookers in general with comprehensive online services and quality printing solutions
789889 the book has everything a retailer needs to know about setting up digital hybrid classes in their stores
789890 after teaching digital scrapbooking for a couple of years ive encountered just about everything
789891 ive included tips to make the teacher look brilliant even if theyre just a beginner
789892 i cant believe how many people actually want to get their certificate at the end 90 of people that start these hands on classes finish the series of five most in the same weekend
789893 well id dearly love to go to hawaii but i hate both airplanes and ships so would you build me a highway from here to there
789894 indeed i said you could have one wish but this one seems nearly impossible could you ask for something easier
789895 ok can you then tell me what is a species
789896 the question of species the question of species among bacteria is at present an insoluble puzzle it has become manifest that it is quite impossible to carry over to the classification of bacteria the conception of word species which zoologists and botanists have developed in the last century it has been recognized by the modern zoologist that the early conception of a species as something sharp and distinct is bound to be modified as variations are recognized if this is true in animals and higher plants it is more emphatically true of bacteria indeed we must practically abandon any thought of using among bacteria the term species with a meaning which has any similarity to that which is used for the rest of the living world the question as to whether physiological variations are sufficient to characterize a new species is one which we cannot now answer but this would be involved in an attempt to determine species of bacteria
789897 it should finally be stated that the forms which we recognize in the following pages which we name must be regarded as groups and not species this is not at all material inasmuch as we have no conception whether the term species has any meaning whatsoever among the bacteria
789898 older papers are superseded by more recent ones and soon forgotten
789899 this is so cool how does it work have you ever studied this in one of your classes
789900 we dont know we definitely had another series in us
789901 theres a sort of fear going back ten years later
789902 that it would be our own phantom menace with cgi backgrounds flat dialogue and unfunny comedy characters
789903 we knew we had to end the midseason finale with something
789904 we argued about whether to reveal that baltar was the fifth cylon or wait a minute
789905 the end of the first half was almost the end of the show because of the writers strike
789906 we were all well that would kind of suck they get to earth and it sucks thank you goodbye
789907 theres a fair amount of what do we do next
789908 and then the story continues in unexpected ways theres a tremendous amount of upheaval its not really the most happy go lucky ten episodes weve ever done which im sure doesnt come as a surprise
789909 in an american story the bad guy gets more tail
789910 when youre preaching that you love god can you be a complete nymphomaniac on the side does that make you less spiritual it took me three years to work that out there are so many people who have goodness in their heart but theyre obsessed with something one particular thing these last few reasons ive found that gaius makes peace with himself on that
789911 its a little scary at times i hope that people teach their children to take starbucks bad and throw it away the drinking a lot and sleeping around use protection im just rambling because i have no idea to answer that question theres a fine line weve tried to walk with her where shes very good at her job and then theres a fine line of turning her into some kind of superhero theres a fine line of whats realistic and whats not
789912 especially the way it deals with gender the men and women on the show shower together fly together and still sleep together it doesnt matter
789913 it was a dream job i stuck around and at the end of season three they give me a script that says youre a cylon and im like fucking wow guess ill be around for a while aaron douglas who plays tyrol was the first one to tell me he was like dude dude dude you heard were gonna be cylons and i was like shut up they dont even know my name on this set theyre even calling me steve
789914 theyre really neat my other one has to do with guns as well the mexican standoff with trucco reminded me when helo and i rescued anders our stunt guy gave me two machine guns and says you can have two machine guns and im like awesome
789915 finally james and i we started the first scene of the miniseries having sex and we finished the main shooting with shooting
789916 filming the end of battlestar was like being in apocalypse now
789917 hard to identify one as the best for me the most memorable moment was watching starbuck and number six pound the entire living shit outve each other for an entire act at the end of season one they wouldnt kiss though no matter how much i begged them
789918 its utterly sublime and a perfect way to finish the show it took me by surprise i remember the final read through was a disgraceful exhibit of tears and lower lip quivering as we got to the end it does everything justice
789919 the final two episodes are perfect theres a lot of closure to a lot of the storylines but there are still some questions which are the way that things should be
789920 the two starred in a stage production of the musical a long time ago
789921 day six ended with jack at the edge of the cliff a very existential moment but an emotional bridge was missing from the season finale
789922 pretty exciting being there gave it a whole new feeling
789923 it was arguably one of the best scripts weve ever had
789924 we werent racing against some clock to get it to air
789925 allowed us the freedom and creativity to make the season even deeper
789926 very well could be a measure of our desperation that hes back
789927 the most difficult thing during the run of the show
789928 were not trying to reinvent the show but make it better tighter and smarter and thats hopefully what youll see in the seventh season
789929 jack is in the bathroom and not only is he peeing hes having a drink and getting something to eat
789930 very organic from where his story has gone since the beginning
789931 i got to shoot at him and tackle him i loved it
789932 while the series is on the air i dont want to mess with a good thing
789933 boys and girls in a perpetual state of arrested development
789934 havent seen the last of either of them death is a relative term on lost
789935 we will say that you will see definitively rousseaus story
789936 and its safe to say that he will make it to the very end
789937 id be a little more worried for the five non line speakers
789938 theres a monsoon coming things are looking up for faraday
789939 you will be rewarded for hanging in all the way to the end of season six
789940 which featured an eye patch clad lindelof and cuse sporting an obama four more years t shirt
789941 i havent done an exorcism in six or seven years
789942 the fact is im very proud of the ep we shot and the series is making me crazy with the excitement but i tend to come at things sideways and there were a few clarity issues for some viewers there were also some slight issues with tone i was in a dark noir kind of place where as many of you know i make my home and didnt bring the visceral pop the network had expected from the script the network was cool about it but not sure how to come out of the gate with the ep
789943 joss came to the realization that there was a better way to start the show
789944 after he wrote episode two he asked the network to use that as episode one

789959 experiences trauma and then tries to come back and love someone
789960 after six feet under i was tired of people talking about their problems
789961 they didnt want to throw us under the american idol bus
789962 death is just the punctuation of everything that has come before
789963 in a different way maybe not better but definitely different
789964 that one idea usurped the other we are aware of the paradox
789965 it is explanable but you will see claire though maybe not for a bit
789966 up until the end of season three we were doing pretty much both
789967 we have 34 hours left season five and season six if we didnt have an end plan we would crash and burn
789968 we knew that hatch was going to blow up at the end of season two but the specifics were more organic
789969 opens the door to a whole new way of storytelling
789970 falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic
789971 one of the greatest advantages is the ability of recombinant adenovirus vectors to reduce gene expression both in vitro and in vivo
789972 nous ne demandons pas un pr sident qui r ponde lui m me ses m ls
789973 mais nous voulons quil comprenne le contexte de ce que les m ls veulent dire
789974 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
789975 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
789976 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
789977 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
789978 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
789979 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
789980 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
789981 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
789982 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
789983 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
789984 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
789985 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
789986 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
789987 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
789988 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
789989 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
789990 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
789991 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
789992 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
789993 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
789994 hey i see you yes im crazy too keep on movin
